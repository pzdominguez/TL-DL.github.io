â€“ A Wisconsin company that's developed a way to make windows more energy efficient has received a $10 million investment from Google, the New York Times reports. robach shield, CEO of Shield, says the investment is the biggest of its kind ever from Google. The company's technology is based on porous glass that acts as a sort of insulation, making windows up to 30% more energy efficient than other types of windows, according to TechCrunch. Shield says its technology could be used to make up for the 40 billion dollars lost every year in the US due to windows that aren't energy efficient.
