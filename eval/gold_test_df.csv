So I got a patron supported that wanted me to talk about passive aggressive women like this is a category of women. All right, guys all women a passive-aggressive. All right guys, when a woman won't set a date with you or you know tell you will see or she cancels a date. That's a woman being passed.Aggressive guys, that's a woman that didn't know how to tell you directly. I'm not interested. All right guys now as y'all guys might know sometimes maybe she did have a little bit of interest but you just did some just went on a kilt that but a lot of times they don't even be that guys when you go up and get some of these women normal guys. They don't want to be confrontational. They know that a rejection is basically a woman's way of saying you're not good enough for me and I'm a I tell you guys why. Women are never off the market. Even if she's married if when you go up and you meet a woman if you are higher value than the man she got at home and what I mean by high value, I mean whatever she values some women are into pretty boys. Some women are into money. Some women are into Charisma more all women are into some of them to some degree, but some women just Are you a man? That's smooth as fuck and some women are just into primarily into looks and some women as y'all guys might know are all about the dollar. So and let me tell you guys like what I mean by that if you are dating a woman and she's with you cuz you are better men provider. That's what she's seeking. She wants a man that's about two dollars that look out for her and a billionaire comes up and approached her and she knows he's a billionaire. Yo chick gonna be gone not that day. Not that day because she got to see what he's about. She gots to see his is he he just want to fuck one time. But if he won't show job, he will have your fucking job. Alright guys. So now she won't leave you that day. She got to see what this motherfucker maybe you only want to ask one time. But if he show us some consistency and she and he shows that he want to be her man. She gonna leave your ass it just that if a woman is into Luke's and Meet a guys that's in her eyes more attractive than you and then after she doesn't talk to him a couple of times on the side. Guess what your chick gonna be going. I got your chick motherfucker. Alright guys, so anytime a woman rejects you what she basically saying is you are not what I'm looking for because there's no such thing as a woman being off the market i period and for any of you guys go jump on your fucking soapbox talking shit if women approached me. N and you will marry in a hotter chick came up and approach you that was hotter than the chick you got at home your ass or do the same fucking thing. Unfortunately for us women do not approach us. And so therefore if you have a wife at home, unless a woman is choosing extremely hard. You really won't go out your way to talk to no other cheese because you married so fuck it. All right. So that's the thing with that some of you guys still be on. All right, some of you guys are still married, whatever you still. Young but so all rejection is a woman's passive-aggressive way of turning you down. I'll pay for all you guys who don't know what passive-aggressive mean that means a person is trying to avoid confrontation. They're trying to tell you something without a confrontation. I have this shit with me on the Train sometimes sometimes strangers us this started talking to me on the train about anything and I'm not talking about because they recognize me on YouTube. I'm just talking about people be sitting on the track and then just start talking. Going about some random shit. And then I take my help ease out. I listen I like. Oh, okay. All right. We all know Spotify as the huge music giant app on Spotify. You can also listen to podcast. They have a huge catalog on every topic including the one you're listening to right now. You can easily share what you're listening to with your friends on Instagram if you haven't done so already Ready, be sure to download the Spotify app search for alpha male strategies and be sure to follow the podcast. All right, and then I'll put my ear PC because I'm being passive-aggressive. I really want to tell them to shut the fuck up but I don't want to do that. So I'm hoping that they understand me put my earpiece back in my ear lets them know motherfucker. I don't want to talk to you and then you'll see them they'll still be talking and then you take the other piece out and be like, oh, okay. All right, and then you put this You see this in the gym, sometimes two motherfuckers come up talking to you when you if you go up help to somebody guys and they try to put the earpiece back in. Why are you talking to them? That means shut the fuck up. All right guys, passive-aggressively. All right guys, so women are do all those type of things guys to avoid confrontation to not hurt your feelings or whatever. That's past my girls now in a relationship a woman does different type of passive aggressive. All right. A woman pulls back. All right, if you're dating a woman she pulls back that's passive aggressive guys. That's not done indirectly. All right, some of us men do it too when we started like when you hit the as a few times to minute well before you was, you know, texting her and ask her out and shit now, you ain't doing it you pulling back a little bit you hoping she get the hint. All right, a pullback is a passive-aggressive way of letting the person know I'm losing fucking interest now. Sometimes it's done hoping that the person You know taste a shit up because they ain't on point and sometimes it's done cause you really tired of motherfucking and you want them to get the hand get the fuck on. Alright guys. So if you date a woman she passive-aggressive if you laying in bed with a woman and you live with her and she sleeps with her back turned to you guys that's passive aggressive and letting you know that I'm losing interest. Oh, I ain't got much issues in you right now all that's passive aggressive guys. Now, there's levels to passive-aggressive. First a woman is passive aggressive. That means she pulls back. She does things to show you that she's losing interest that's passive aggressive guys. All right silent treatment all this shit all that's done passive-aggressive if you don't pick up on it, or if you pick up on it, and you start acting insecure about it. That's when the masculine energy comes. Alright, so first a woman is passive aggressive. She pulls back she tries to dusting to let you know she's losing interest the Great way to handle it is for you to pull back and get on your fucking purpose and shit like that and let her come back to you. All right, that's the correct way of doing it. But if you didn't do it that way you start acting insecure or accuse her of cheating and shit like that. That's when the masculine energy comes. All right that lets you know that it's really low. Alright guys, so that's all that is what that passive aggressive guys. Is that that's just a way of woman lets, you know, all women are passing. There's no such thing as talk about passengers you be at basically a Asking me to talk about 4 billion women because all women are passive aggressive and when a woman won't typically if a woman is being passive-aggressive and she wants you to make some changes to where she really cares about you and she wants you to make some changes. She used it'll do us in a passive-aggressive match message on social media Facebook or some shit like that that you are. No she's talking about you but the and everybody else would know she talking about you. But she really wants some change and she's also playing the victim card. All right, that way she's letting everybody know look at the sorry piece of shit that I got at home. Alright guys, so that's the thing with that guys. So just pay attention. All passive-aggressive is a woman losing interest. All right, and all women are passive aggressive. It's a feminine trait, but we men also have it too sometimes sometimes I am comfor tation. I'll let you know. All right, and sometimes I'm not all right men and women both carry trace a masculine and Feminine energy. Obviously, we care more masculine than women, but we still some of us guys are passive aggressive to guys. All right, so that's the situation with that and I had another Patron supported. I wanted me to talk about being mentally strong. All right guys, mentally being mentally strong guy comes from going through trials and tribulations and when you go through those trials and tribulations, it's not about crying while you were at the bottom. It's about figure it out. How can you be better next time what got you in this position? Like when you see basketball players football players and shit, like let's let's think back to the Chicago Bulls or the 90s right when the Pistons will be Nee ass in the late 80s early 90s, right right before the Bulls won their first championship. All right, when the Piston will be named as what they did each season in the you guys know each season. They push them closer and closer to they finally beat them so they was learning from them. Mistakes see that's the thing about being mentally strong. You have to learn from your mistakes. All right, when I first joined on YouTube and you know David Koechner was taking shots at me and shit. I show week mental strength because I would lash out and respond back to it. All right. And when this after I came to Patron and I went back I learned something from that II like I said, man, you know, what can we do? Because this ain't going on. Well, alright, if you going to be on YouTube and you're going to be getting the views that you getting and they getting the views that they getting well jealousy is going to come with that. So, how are you going to handle that? Are you going to stay here and have a Jocelyn match with these motherfuckers going backwards and for all right, or are you going to learn from what you did last time guys? Come on here all the time. Hey, did you see such made that video about UAMS you need to respond. I ain't responding to shit. All right, guys, that's what I learned from that I don't even watch guys. Come over here not letting me know all these guys people making reaction videos about me. I don't even watch the reaction videos about me period I made a video about Derek Jackson and somebody told me he was funded to a comment and go check it out. And then that come in. He said I ain't seen the video and I'm not going to Watch the video and that is precisely how you handle the guys when people like me being on YouTube and shit. What I learned is, you know, not only do you not respond. Do not even watch it. I don't care if they make a hundred reaction videos to me. I don't watch one of them. All right, that's the thing with that guys. So the thing about being mentally strong is that usually means that you had a low point if you're being mentally strong that means you're at a low point now, You got to look at what can I do to come back stronger and better next time when I was at the gym? In a client would not want to rehire me to train them when they will come through an a you know, you know money's a little tight right now, which is bullshit. I don't see you fucking moving out of fucking Manhattan. I see you still paying that six grand a month for rent. So ain't no fucking financial problems. You just don't want me to try. Well, I learned to be a what I took from that EOS. I need to become a better trainer surely enough. I started hearing that less and less and less take the very end when I was training. I had lost a client and over two years guys over two years. All right guys that because I seen that I'm losing clients. I felt like it was something that I was not giving the clients and instead of mibu and and crying and want to quit what I took from that is I needed to enhance my skills. All right guys, so being mentally strong is not about suck it up and be a man being mentally strongest taking something from the lesson taking something from that ass-whooping you. Eating right now and coming back stronger next time. Alright guys as I get bigger and bigger than your own on YouTube and shit like that. You're gonna see more reaction videos. You don't seem oh hey and guess what? You ain't gonna get out of me. You ain't gonna get not one responds you be talking to your motherfucking self. I wouldn't give a fuck if somebody showed y'all a picture of me fucking a pig and five years old. I ain't get a missile got to respond to this. They got your father to paint you you gotta respond. It ain't responding to Shit, believe what you wanna believe? I don't give a fuck if they got a picture of me being a 90 year old lady up. Well Kane Ain't responding to shit. Believe what you wanna believe. I'm not responding to Jack. All right guys, that's what I fucking lurk about it. Alright guys. So if you if somebody is hating on you in your unless it's being disrespectful. Just ignore it. All right, if somebody being disrespectful they hate on you and your face. Oh, you need to check the ass. But if somebody just hating from afar let they ass hate for my father. Somebody come telling you some other fucking say it behind your back man. Listen, you know what I would tell them up like that man. I don't even want to hear I don't care what they say it. They said my fucking face. That's why would somebody come try to tell me something if somebody on my YouTube Channel right now right now comes on my channel and try to tell me somebody say Some about me on my YouTube. I block them for being messy for being a little bitch. I blocked the ass trying to bring Miss to me. Hey, it'll Miss Southern such channels that I never even fucking heard of and I blocked the ass for being a little bitch. All right, I don't block them for relaying the message. I blocked him from being a bitch. That's what I blocking for. I don't even want to hear it. Alright guys, so that's how you become mentally strong guys when you go through something. Take a lesson from that as in what can I do different next time? How did I get myself in this situation? All right guys and learn from it. Alright. Alright guys, so that's the situation with that like the video comment down below what you guys want to see next. Holler back.","– If you're a guy who's never met a woman who's not interested in meeting you, well, you're not the only one.

Thanks.Hello and welcome back to nothing. But a bob thing I am Justin The Fierce and he is Justin. I'm Nathan the brave. Yeah, I mean you're brave in your own way. I mean, I think you're brave enough. I get out of the house every day. That's pretty brave. If I say so but you put your pants on one leg at a time just like everybody know I'm brave. I put I put my pants on two legs at a time. You've got a wire.Suspended I jump in time to jump into my pants evidence out of your bed. It takes 10 to 15 tries. But I eventually nailed it. What a way to start the day. Hmm. That's why you don't have to drink coffee. You've already fallen. It's yeah, I mean, I may have a concussion by the time I get to work but my pants were on and that's what matters dr. S you so how did you get the concussion you play a contact sport? Yes. Oh tonight friends. We are going to be journeying down a lazy river, but For that it is traditional on the show to have some sort of little factoid about Bob in this case today. We have a bob news story who's Bob news Bob news, but new All Rise. So I think we can all agree that the late Bob Ross has really not gotten the respect. He deserves in the art community. Yes. Weather whether you really like what he makes or not. He is a very influential art figure indeed and he deserves some recognition. I think we on this show were championing that in our own small way. Well, let me tell you Bob Ross is finally having some paintings featured in the museum exhibition. You're kidding. It's taken him being dead 24 years to finally get done. Wow, but the DePaul Art Museum. Okay, Chicago. Oh wow is having an exhibition called New Age strategies for survival. Ooh, I like that. Wow. So for of his landscape paintings, which represent self-care in the New Age movement. Yeah are included in the exhibition. That is excellent. Yeah. So do you think of price of a bob painting just shot way up? I mean, I would assume so once you get featured in a museum or recognized yeah, which is it's ludicrous that hasn't happened so far. I mean good on you too. Paul Museum this a which which ones which pieces it doesn't say. Okay. Well, we'll have to keep following this story. I'd be really curious to know. So this is his official Museum debut. Okay, his work has once been loaned out to the Lyndon B Johnson Presidential Library Okay, not really. Yeah an art museum per se right, right. I mean to be fair. I haven't been to the Lyndon B Johnson Presidential Library. Maybe it's full of great art. Are we to suppose then that Lyndon B Johnson was a fan but Bob Ross and The Joy of Painting. I mean, I guess I would like to know that it would be really random if if Lyndon B Johnson just didn't care about Bob Ross. Yeah. Anyway, I did stick. There's just one guy who's like, you know, it'd be awesome. Bob Ross. Did London like it? Yeah, but Bob I films job like four years ago curating for this this library and man we have had some wild shit up in here man. We're just gonna put Bob floored fucking ceiling every day man and blast of fucking Fish Man top volume, you know, I'm saying Trey Anastasio man. Fuck I got some cushion the back you want some the Lyndon B Johnson library has the world's largest fish bootleg collections. That's right. No one can prove. I'm wrong in the house employees which are all those people like Park Rangers. Yeah. They probably are see they're like super hippie Park Rangers. I love this idea. So what was the name of the exhibit again at the museum in Chicago? Chicago new age New Age. Yeah to nuages MMM don't know why: strategies for survival. I like the strategies for survival. That seems I wonder what other artists are going to be in the exhibit to I'm glad you asked. Okay Rashid Johnson not familiar Tony or Isler and Robert Pruitt. We should know these people but we don't because we're not real are. Oh, I know all those people again. You can't prove it strip. No, but I the the strategies for survival. Yeah, I mean that's kind of been one of the thesis that we've had on this show is that you know, people are turning back to Bob as a way to relax in this crazy world much like ASMR much like the CBD phenomenon. People are just trying to relax. Yeah. It's very very difficult to relax when you're on your screens constantly. Yes. Listening to Cheeto Hitler. Yeah, you know things like that out off at the mouth. Yeah, I spew. Yeah. I mean there's there's a lot going on. There's a lot of tension. Mmm, and even I mean even the mall soft and vaporwave music, I feel like there's an element of relaxation doll that that one's more confusion painting painting you work with a great deal of Illusions. So in addition to Our Bob news we just before recording tonight. We just put it out on Twitter to the twitterverse. Hey any questions for us as we record tonight and our good friend Chris on Twitter who listens to both this show and our other shows who jackknife which you're more than welcome to listen to the content varies significantly, it would be very strange if you forbid them from listening to it. You were forbidden. Yeah, Chris a Asks, I'm not sure if you guys answered this in a past episode. But what is your first memory of Bob Ross? So I'll go first okay because mine is not interested. Okay. I don't have a specific memory. Gotcha. I just remember it being on TV show all the time. Sure my family we didn't have cable. Yeah for most of my life no cable. No satellite anything like that. So we had ABC Fox CBS NBC PBS right maybe TBM. Yeah, in case you wanted to listen to a preacher quote heal someone or through a dollars on a stage. Yeah. I'm just imagining a strip club Church strip club church. So, you know you flip through the channels just like six choices. Yeah. And Bob was one of them. Yeah, I grew up very similar to you didn't have satellite. There wasn't ever cable. I mean I saw cable it other people's houses and stuff, but I'd heard I'd heard of it. Yeah, but I mostly grew up in a pretty rural area with whatever we could pick up on rabbit ears back before your digital antenna kids and yeah similar it was, you know, ABC Fox CBS all the networks and BC and then yeah, we would pick up PBS. Okay, and we also picked up this channel called packs. Oh, yeah, which was like a sewer pipe. I left them off the list. Yeah. Now I feel bad packs came in clear than anything else. Honestly, that's because it had the Lord's power button. And so the best shows on packs were Diagnosis Murder featuring your And in mind Dick Van Dyke, yeah all all the old reruns diagnosis murder and his son Barry Van Dyke, I think bear bear bear and their family is what Van Dyke brown is named after PS. You don't know if that's true. Yeah, I'm sure it's fine. So packs would run that and then at night my favorite thing. Maybe I was trying to chill out. They would have nature scenes with this like classical very light remember this I do like classical music in the background be like a water faucet. It's like a live-action Bob Ross painting really this would come on like whenever Dana's murder went off the air or like what was the show? Highway to Heaven Michael Landon, where are Touched by an Angel whenever those were off. Yeah, you get nature scenes with Bible verse not read aloud, but just projected on top of the nature seemed kind of disrupting the Nature's right? It was sort of, you know flow in and melt away and then this like really light classical music going and it was I mean, it's a great way to fall asleep was fantastic way to fall asleep. I would really like Like to have been the person who chose the Bible verses for that because I'm just saying throwing something up front of the story of Joe. But over that we righty crates are one of those chapters were it's just someone begat someone else and just slowly covers the entire screen just keeps fading him. We got him. We got him. We got him. We got him the gun. I can't see the Gobi desert of or what the hell so so because I had a similar TV situation and I would Been a lot of Summers with my grandmother who worked at a dry cleaners and there was a glass top table in the back and a small TV on the glass-top table. She would sometimes have to go to the front and when she wasn't doing that or doing something else we would just sit there and watch TV. So I watched a lot of Price is Right. He's the catch Northern Exposure, which was also pretty cool show and definitely a lot of EVs and so I'm pretty sure that's where I first saw Bob at some point in there, you know, I was born in 84. So Bob was definitely doing his thing when I was a child same for you. I mean, you're a little bit younger. But yeah, and then she also had her house we stay with her for a while and she had one of those big wooden TVs, you know in an entertainment center. Yeah anything the ones that are an actual piece of furniture. Yeah, exactly. And I remember like spending hours like, you know laying on my stomach on the Carpet with my hands you propping my head up. And I know I watch Bob Rost are to I'm sure that I did sure that I came across it - just you know, I was watching TV. Yeah General. Yeah. I also if anyone knows and I've mentioned this another podcast. I may have created this memory. I've done a lot of Internet research can't find it. I came across a show on PBS pretty sure it was PBS when I was a kid where a woman received a test-tube baby on her doorstep and he grew into a little boy and she took care of the little boy. That's basically all I remember but it made an impression on me and I can't figure out what it was. What was that scripted? Yeah, it was scripted. Yeah. It was like it was a drama like a like a you know, kind of a light drama show. Yeah. He was just like a A premade baby that she got. Yeah like you do. Yeah in her adventures and raising him she was a single, you know single mom. It's like hey, so the baby was still in the test tube. Yeah, he likes showed up and like a capsule or something and she cracked it open and was like, oh my God a baby and it's not scientifically sound. No. No, that's not certainly not I don't I'll talk about this with you later. Okay off the air. Yeah, that's not where baby, okay. Come from. Oh really? I have a few things to talk to my wife about yeah. All right, everybody. Let's get knees deep into the Lazy River season 2 episode 10. What a lazy river. It is. Bob hit us with some lazy river. Welcome back. Glad to see you again. Thought today would do just a happy little picture this deep in the woods. Okay original air date, November 2nd 1983. Yeah a nice vintage of Bob tonight. What do we got? What do we well, I mean we have a lazy river. We have a lazy river. So I'm just going to go ahead and say before we discuss the full painting. Okay. This is one of those paintings that confuses me about Bob sure because I look at it. And just looking at it. I do not care for the painting. Okay. I don't actively dislike the painting. I just don't care. I know you're saying not great. So you're saying yeah, but watching him paint it. Yeah, I'm like, oh that's really good. So it's a very confusing situation for me where I like I like the process and I like seeing him do it all but I hate the end result. Yes. Right, right. It's one of those it's enjoyable to watch and put it together. Right and there's a lot of them. I mean he again in this has been Theme lately he broke out some new techniques that's true, which is really fun and his little toy gun. Yeah. Anyway, yeah, which he we still don't know what it is. Yeah. I don't think we're ever going to know is what it is an our person. Let us know what it's called. Please go watch The Lazy River episode. You can fast forward to about half way through about half way. Yeah, and he pulls out his little little carving gun. That's it. What is it? We don't know it's his tree branch toy. That's all. I know. That's it. That's it. I picture. It's like it just a crayon and a gun. Yeah, I don't know. I've no clue what sky start with this guy a nice. We got some trees. You said we're at trees and under two minutes. He's painting we get started right away laying in some trees and their background trees are diffuse trees. They're not offensive not offensive at all. Laughs and you know, I I certainly don't offend me fright. No, I enjoyed these trees. Yeah, quite a bit actually socata Sky trees Tree Trunks and then we start to lay in some ground and the Van Dyke brown makes an appearance pretty soon too and I can tell you I was very concerned. Yeah because as as we've established the last few episodes Van Dyke brown has become my treat. Yeah, I do not. Not like it when he pulls up a VanDyke anytime. He's reaching for it Nathan shudders a bit. It's just ruined so many things I liked and paintings. It's usually not that bad in situations like this where it's not covering something up already. Right? Right, but still it's a little nerve-racking. Listen. It's it's a very thick and dramatic color and not used properly it can wreath. No, not wreath. It can it could wreath a kid wreath destruction. Yeah, why not whatever. I'm trying to say. Um, yeah, whoops. There's one that's nice and crooked hate for them all to be straight. Maybe a fisherman kicked that one when he was just a little baby and he's got a little cooking we get a quick shot of Bob. We rarely get these little Snippets of the full Studio like a wide shot very rarely get those and let me just tell you everybody Bob is packing some heat. Oh, yeah in the back of his pants Bob could back that thing. He's got a tight ass. I mean, he's got the kind of That's the putting in some cowboy boots and send him to you know, the Wildhorse Saloon here in Nashville. Yeah, and ladies are going to be all over Bob Bob could shake those tail feathers. That's right. Shake it like a Polaroid picture. Oh, yeah. He has very he's a thin man. He has thin skinny, you know kind of skinny arm. Yeah, his frame is skinny, but he's got a couple of well-formed hams under there. You know what I mean? Yeah. No, sir. Salt added nitrate free organic whole it's like it's like a couple firm mango. That's it. That's it. You know something to hold about that August our lawsuit that we've been waiting for you they talked about is a slot PLS someone put that in a review positive or negative. I don't care just mention that we talk about Bob's ass all the time. This is the predominant Bob's ass podcast. That's right first really cool technique. Yeah. Even though we're on a lazy river. He never actually paints water. Not at all which still kind of blows my mind a little bit amazing amazing. So Bob's putting a lot of color into the shore the trees the Van Dyke brown the foliage and as he so often does so beautifully he just pulls that down to make a reflection and then hypnotizes it and suddenly as he does this over and over. Again, you get the real impression that you're looking at a body of water. Yeah, I will say one really positive thing for this painting. It is one of those that really draws you in like I'm being that's true. I'm being drawn down the river right now as I look at it, you know, and there's not even any waves or anything. It's a lazy river. Yeah now it's I mean nothing's happening very aptly named. I I will say yeah, I know this is nitpicking, okay. That's not river. It's more of a stream even a brook. I don't know. I mean it even looks like it could be a pond a creek. It's not it's not a river but going anywhere. There's no River. Okay. I know it's nitpick. No. No, it's it's a fair. It's a fair point. The only counter I have to that is is I feel like you can see a Bend there is a bit at the very back like there's a suggestion of a Bend, right? Yeah. And so that means that this continues far beyond what we can see it continues into our imaginations. All right. Okay, I'll give it to you. Okay. Um, so just by pulling all that color down we get this amazing impression. He does a little shorelines the little white. Yeah short lines, which I like a lot as well really, it sets it off from the reflection. Yes. Yeah. It adds a little bit of motion I guess. And it's just a relaxing picture overall it just I mean my even as it's finished now, I was done with the painting at about 15 18 minutes. I was fine. He could have stopped. We it's another one of those days you wish exactly we get we have this this happens all the time. It was exactly what I wanted right at that point. And then what happened Nathan? Well, I'm glad you asked. And you noticed another thing here. We put no color into the water all we're going to use for coloring the water is what we pull down. You don't have to go to a lot of trouble and put color in here. All you do is pull it down. Just wipe across to give it a nice watery Sheen and it looks like water without doing a thing. I'm still not sure exactly what it is. Yeah, but a tree is put in. Oh, yeah now I have a few things about this tree. So it's on the right side on the bank. Yep. Just a trunk that goes from nearly the bottom past the bottom third right of the painting all the way up the top of the tree is not in frame exactly paint exactly big big big. So it's a very very tall skinny tree. Yeah. I mean very tall skinny tree. Me being the way I am. The first thing I noticed is on this bank. There's not room in that bank for the root ball for a tree that big. Yeah, there's no way yeah, there's no way that tree survived. Okay. Okay, like it's not going to stay in the ground. It's going to fall over. Yeah. Okay. Okay. Number two. It clearly looks like Bob doesn't study how trees meet the ground. Yeah. Because both so he does this with this tree and then there's another tree off to the right the another big one both of them the trunk just kind of like curves at the ground. Yeah. Yeah one side like it just goes an L shape. Yeah. It's kind of how I used to paint trees. Yeah, when I was a child, it's that's still how I paint trees by the way. That's not how Roots were right, right. He pointed out that you need a tree to shade you when you're fishing indeed you do which I mean that's good advice, but I want you to look at that tree real quick. I'm looking at it tell me how much shade like there are trees all over this River very shady trees and you chose the half-dead waterlogged. Tiny rooted giant tree. Yeah as your and like No shade from that tree that tree is on its last leg. It's about to die. It's even leaning. Yeah, it's leaning towards the water. It's giving up right it's leaning because it's saying if I try hard enough I can drown myself there. You're right. The leaves are sparse. Yeah. However the way we get those leaves is another really cool technique. Oh, it's fantastic. This is palette knife leaves. Yeah brand-new as far as I'm concerned never seen this before he loads up. Some marbled color. I think it's some green and some yellow maybe a touch a permanent red and places and I love it when he says that to like mix it until it's just marbled marbley and I know what he means right? It's like not completely mixed together. It's a good description. You swirl it it's world price world. It's chocolate and vanilla. Yeah not totally combined. You want the swirl? So he loves that up on the palette knife and extremely lightly touches it horizontally on the branches. It just makes these Little impressions of like I don't know like levels of leaves and they're just cool. They look kind of Japanese almost, you know, I get some it's a really cool technique and I really like it really is one thing about those branches. Yeah, and I'd like you to explain to me, why are all the branches on the trees growing downwards? That's a great question. I'm just so it's a great question. Question two trees. Yeah, well and you say to their he not only do we get this one we get another one even more in the foreground. Yeah a little wider. So with the entire leafy portion it out of view. That's correct that the branches that you see they're all just growing straight down. Yeah, it's true. Like they have also given up all this tree is just very depressing. There's no denying it. There's no denying it. What? Whoever my friend and last tree point I have to make yeah, and I feel very mixed complaining about this because I like the Reflections in the water a lot. Yeah, however There's no Reflection from from the big tree. Right? Like it didn't reflect. There's a couple big Reflections. He missed it's a vampire vampire who owe a couple of vampire trees. You say maybe that's maybe it's not a real type of tree. Oh Lazy River underscore alternate title vampire trees. We all have established at this point the Bob's paintings do not exist in reality. Correct. He's painting a fall seen in the middle of winter on a summer day. That's right. Every painting is like in the ocean vampire trees. It could be not Off the Mark. No, I think my question to you is would that necessitate a bonus point it was unintentional unintentional or okay Counterpoint, okay. Was it fully intentional? Mmm, and we're just the first ones to realize it out. Alright, well, we'll talk about that in a minute. If you're going out here to fish you need a nice tree to sit underneath. Keep the sun off your head. I don't know Nathan any other major things about this painting. I mean that Mama less covers a lot the so he spent a lot of time on this. I feel like for what he did. Yeah, but the very end the last thing he did is just some floating Pond scum. Yeah. That was great. We both like the pond scum which it's just a little layer of Van Dyke brown. Yeah, and then mixed some yellow and some green A little Bush material and and put it on top and you're like, okay, whatever it's fine. Yeah, and then the fan brush just swipes it up. Oh, yeah, and I think we've all seen this on any body of water where it's just like the the kind of like plant sticking out of algae. Yeah type of thing. Yeah. That's what it looks like it. What's this shit growing in the water? Yeah. I mean it for such a small part of the painting. Yeah. He spent an odd amount of time. On it to me more minutes. Yeah, but it was interesting know. I was very good I get you. I guess it's like a tiny little Island right there. Yeah, and then yeah, of course, he spent a lot of time to filling in foliage a lot of yellow kind of grassy stuff highlighting the land masses, which I always enjoy I do like the Van Dyke rocks with white o it one point. This was really cool to me. He's picking up when he's highlighting. He's Up some of the not quite dry magic white. Yes off the bark and on about the that was so cool. It's like Bob like you're breaking my mind. Like you're just using what's there man? You're so Zen Bob. He's like who cares? It's right here. I got it. I'm just listen to Bob season to Bob is all over the place compared to season one bomb. Yeah in a good way. Yes season 1 Bob. I feel like was playing it safe. Maybe it was afraid he was going to get kicked out of Muncie. I don't know WIP be Be pissed but season to Bob. I know he just does his own thing. I you know, I think he is growing in confidence. We're most of the way through only a couple episodes left to season 2. He's a veteran TV painter. Now, that's true. One of only two who have ever existed as far as we know the only one who has success exactly. Yeah. Well, he doesn't yell as much don't tell the Alexander family. I said that we liked you Bill they'll yell at me. But yeah, just another crazy cool technique. He's just like here's some magic white. I just need a little right here done done using it one every painting the season even the ones we hated. Yeah, there was one thing in each one that you see that you're like, huh love that. Well, okay, he has broken out no less than I would say seven or eight like really crazy cool techniques. Yeah in this season and a weird gun that we don't know what it is exactly. By the way. This is a total of side, but I was reminded this week of another PBS Superstar who I'm interested in not heal Hauser who I have a deep interest in you. I love you love early and erotic actress who else Huell Howser if you're not familiar, he was based in California. He's actually from Tennessee was from Nashville used to be on TV in Nashville, but he did these shows about traveling around California. It's all on YouTube. Check it out. It's fantastic. Another one is Justin Wilson the Cajun chef. Do you remember this guy? Oh, I vaguely remember love him. Oh my gosh, you can barely understand what he's saying, but he just makes the most delicious. He's right up there with Julia Child for me makes the most delicious looking food and he's always drinking wine. Where is the Spenders wearing a little Colonel Sanders Tie, by the way, if you're if you're cooking Cajun food, and you're not drinking while you Cook it. You're not you're not cooking cage. You're doing it wrong. Like you're messing up entire recipe exactly the entire recipe depends on you being slightly slightly. Slosh. You need to do it a little bit, you know overdo it. Yeah. Now what I did there was just picked up a little bit of the magic white so I can put just as very small small amount of highlight into that don't want a lot just a tiny tiny bit. All right. Well, let's do this. This rate the pain rating great here comes a rating hot into your lap for the Lazy River into your lap. Yeah, that's where we're putting. Our rating is ensure people's laps. Don't you want to go there? I mean I do I wasn't going to be that forward about it. I like a lot of laps for those under the show. Unfamiliar forgetful. Maybe you're forgetful and Repainting that we we watch is rated on a five category for point scale. Yeah for a maximum score of 20 points any points bonus points can be awarded at our discretion as we see fit. Yeah. This is our show but usually usually involves some someone dying a Drifter an alcoholic mythical creature. It happens in more than you would expect. Fact there's a magical to te Welbeck. Yeah. Yeah. So lazy river Lazy River first category is visual impact is real impact for is it has the power to wow the viewer, okay. Three is it has lasting impact to it holds your attention one little or no impact I think for and won both off the both off the table. This is a Midway. That's a pretty extreme a great choice right there for me. Again. It really drew me in. I feel like I'm chugging on down this Lazy River. I used to canoe poorly. Um, but I used to Whitewater canoe and I have seen stretches of river. Quite like this now that's exciting in one way because it's beautiful. It's not exciting because you have to paddle now right for a while. You don't want to Raft down real lazy Willow. No, no you want these slightly active river that will move you want the agitated River? Yeah, so you would say it has lasting impact on you. Yeah, I would give it a 3 personally. I don't know if I'm being generous. I don't think I am I like this. I really like it. I feel like I'm I'm being hard on it. Okay, but I feel like it's gotta be two two and a half for me to put a half compromise. Nothing against it. I'm just not going to remember it's fine. It's fine. We don't always have to agree. It wasn't it wasn't memorable to me. Sure. It's good. It's not memorable. Yeah, okay interpretation and creativity. It shows unique and creative interpretation and the effort was far beyond that required texts a 4 that's a 4 all the way down at A1. It's incomplete and lacks attention to detail is not a wood. It's not a one. What are you thinking? Well, alright. So a 3 here with more effort. It would have been outstanding. Okay, that's tricky language. It's actually less effort. Right we come to this off. That's true. We come to this point very often. Let's okay. Let's change the looks. I like writing here. I like it with different efforts like it with different efforts have been Yes, i'ii sounds right to me. Love it. Okay. I'm down with that. Okay, you know what? That's a really good change with different effort because it could be less could be more you know, yeah, I mean there are times he puts way too much into some true. It's true this painting borders on that. I'd like to see Bob do one of those minimal paintings where you only get one color just to see what it would be like, you know, that would be interesting what he or yeah a painting where he's only given 10 minutes, that would also be Resting because there have been a lot. Yeah where we hit the ten-minute Mark and we're like it's done. I don't know what he's gonna do to fillet. Oh, he got the Van Dyke brown out. What is he doing? It's all gone Melton ruined composition and design. Okay. All right. All right F4 is the design effectively fills the entire space. Okay, and it uses the principles of design. A1 is he does not understand the principles of he's never going to get a 1 here. No. No, he shouldn't be painting if he ever gets a one right? There is no excuse for getting a one. Correct, correct? I've I feel like actually a for I would agree. I think he effectively filled the space. Yeah, which it's interesting because of the the amount he didn't paint in the middle exactly like that some good exactly utilization of the space right there again, this gets it that Zen thing, right and that sort of Taoist thing of like, well, there's an old saying like what makes a bowl useful the empty space. Yeah. What makes this painting awesome the empty Ace and he used it. He used it. I I can't really it's a off any point for it's a beautiful scene. I might re-watch this episode honestly. Yeah, it really means it. Yeah, if you've listened to the podcast but haven't watched any episodes. Yeah, I will say this episode if you just want to see the painting. Yeah, the different styles that he pulls out. Yeah. This is a good episode. I agree. Yeah, I'd recommend this one. One it's not the most exciting painting. It's not the flashiest episode. No, but the fundamentals of what he does are there. It's really chill and it's all over the place. I mean everything he does is on that canvas indeed indeed craftsmanship. Okay, a for is it's beautiful and complete. Okay, A1 is its careless know what's a what's a three it demonstrates partial skill and understanding of medium qualities and it's fairly neat. Okay. Hmm. Oh, I'm sorry that that's a that's a chew. Okay, it's pleasing and and mostly complete. I'm gonna lean on a 3 here. I think it's three. Okay. Good good. Yeah good. I think we might pull out a solid B on this. It's not bad. It's not bad. And of course the criteria. Yes. Now here's where our debate comes in. Oh boy. Pom. Pom pom for those who don't know the four. Means he met the requirements. He promised us a lazy river. He delivered a lazy river right now. Can we agree that? This is a actually a lazy river It's a lazy body of It's a lazy body of water. So the minimum giving them is a three. Okay. All right. I think the river I think it's a lazy river. Um, because I see the bend Look deep into creating can bend fine creaks can bend. Okay freaks. All right Rivers. Okay, and they're lazier than Rivers. Sure. It's true. That is actually very true. Good point. What did you say three then? I mean I could make an argument for a for a three for three. Okay, which I think may be the first time I've ever not given them a four four criteria cat in this Killer. Maybe maybe. Yeah, if it's ambiguous whether it's a river or not. Yeah, I can't be a for right because that's all we're asked with the saw. He's supposed to deliver its but it does have the lazy. It's got the lazy Dale delays. So it's at least a 2 right. I'm gonna I'm gonna do this. Okay as I gave we averaged out to a half Point earlier. We did three point five. Okay. I'm good with that. I'm good with a 3-1 average it out now 3.5 do the Trees get a bonus point. Oh boy. No, I think we should give ourselves a bonus Point. Okay, so I get 1 point you get a point one point. Yeah. Well you came up with it. Okay, I'll take two points. You get no I get nothing. Bob doesn't get anything extra. Right? Right. Okay, so plus to Nathan bonus tree vampire trees got right. I'm putting that down The Ledger. By the way, my maximum score was Zero. Yeah, so I'm so far above your ward I could possibly so what's the total here? Let's see you have you have the numbers in front of you? I don't you I do. Hang on so that number. This is this is riveting. I know we are looking at a 16 16 out of 20 20. Yeah. That's an 80 he got the be boom. I need sold out the be - yeah be - yeah, but I mean not bad. It's a beam. I know I agree it started and it's not be you know, what we I think our expectations were much lower. Honestly. I I really honestly didn't know good. Like I said watching the episode right late just looking at the painting. Let's say you go to now no an art gallery in Go and they have Barbara's paintings. And this is one of them. Yeah, you're going to look at and go hmm and move on because without watching it being painted. It's it's not anything. It's not gonna sink into your psyche like some other paintings. Yeah, it's not amazing. No, it's not that's the lasting impression. You know, that's that's I think is a real key thing. But like last last week's episode. Yeah, that's a painting that you Remember, right the last episode we did was very memorable dance in the mud sticks in the mud this one. Yeah. Yeah that said if I encountered it, I would stop and again be drawn into it for a moment. Yeah, lasting impact maybe not but I'm but it definitely had an impact right, you know, but watching it right you and seeing all of the techniques the the technique with the lead. Is the technique where you didn't pay any water? No water. That's my magic water. Yeah, that's impressive that magic water might be my favorite thing this season. Yeah, honestly, honestly, really really cool really cool and definitely worth seeing it come together just a doubly recommend the episode for sure. Yeah Link in the show notes PS. Yeah. We always link read the show notes the show notes. You know, how much? Work just inputs into the show notes quite a bit actually literally weeks that quit his job just so you could write these show knows it. That's it's all I'm doing now. I know I know I know just had an idea here. We'll do that one like that will make a nice little bank right here. I need a little place. I can go out here and set and fishing catch a big old bastard lives out here Nathan where can people get in touch with us. Well, I'm glad you asked first off. They just wander around and say our names until we show up. If you say it three times. We magically appear behind you. You could also go to Twitter. That's twitter.com. If you're logging in from your computer, yeah find us at Bob underscore Thang with an a pod right? Sometimes we are active. Sometimes we aren't you can also follow I'm mostly on atsushi jackknife the Twitter handle for our other show, which has a hundred and forty-three. I think episodes something like that many. Many of them last week. We went into detail just towards the end of the show about the phrase Soup To Nuts Soup To Nuts Soup To Nuts soup to butts. Yeah. Um, you can also email us. It's nothing no G but a bob thing at gmail.com as many of our friends frequently do um, I had this on the anchor app on the anchor app leave us a review in iTunes or Stitcher wherever you listen you just want pod. Cast you know, I want more of what do you want my voice mails? The voice thing is nice the voice memos and anchor and that is cool. Yeah. Yeah. It's really fun.

No, how could it how could it ever occur? It's possible. Yeah, well So folks, I think this was a fun one this week and thanks for being with us. We are nearing the end of season 2 the plan is to as we wrap up season to probably at the end of season 2 we're going to do a bit of videoing of ourselves attempting to paint a painting it will be terrible our good friend phthalo. Dave sent us lots of art supplies and actually found a couple of smaller canvases today. Say that we can use yeah wowzers and they'll oh Dave I feel like they'll oh Dave and I mean he can message us and let me know if I'm wrong just send us painting supplies so he can laugh directly at her face highly doubtful highly doubtful, you know, by the way directly how bad it will be. Did we tweet a picture of his bearing because again, it was amazing. I believe he sent us a painting and it was great. Yeah look back in the history. We got our on our Twitter and see if it's there. I believe we did. Yeah, well everyone thanks for being with us. And as we always say here on the show, just remember however, things are going in life and they're probably going piss-poor right now. That's the spirit. There are no mistakes. Just happy accidents and good night. This baby is getting close to being done. And I think it was a lot of fun if you were painting along with and sit home. I hope you have a happy heart. But now I'm and you really begin to stand back and admire what you've done and it's just fantastic what can be done. Very well and television quite bright that you can use very subdued quiet colors at all. Whatever makes you happy because this is your world. I need a lot of little ones and we don't have much time. But the idea is that we give you here. We hope that you're just going. Absolutely wild with this. And paint your own masterpieces put your own dreams on canvas.","– Bob Ross was an American artist best known for his landscapes, but he's also known for having a thing for fish.

But yeah, and I think it'd be harder like I'm curious to see what happens to like Skylar and all that like in the context of maybe a bigger thing, but that might be a harder movie to make exciting because like characters like Jesse and Saul and stuff are involved in like shady, you know, crazy criminal stuff and like Skylar's I assume what that character would be doing is just trying to raise a family outside of all that craziness, you know, I think like when I look back and braking That in retrospect.",G,"There's probably a lot of like Mexican drug cartels toughest to deal with so now that I'm excusing it rightly sure at all.

Kurkjian Fran fraschilla Ian Begley whole bunch of awesome guests all around basketball this episode. I'm going to try to do a two-minute take on just about every team in the league through two games, which every team has at least played by now two minutes two games. Perfect. Nice. Concise quick takes on every team. If you only care about your team. I'm going in order on the standings right now starting with the Eastern Conference. So pretty easy to figure out starts with the Lana ends with Sacramento all the way through the NBA really appreciate you guys listening and without further Ado. Let's check out my thoughts on the leak so far. All right starting with Atlanta to know start impressive obviously question. Will it be sustainable Trey young is having a score nearly 40 every game. I know Kevin herders still working his way back from injury, you know, he's obviously far from a hundred percent. My question with Atlanta has just been basically the depth issue. They don't really have a backup point guard. They're really thin camera. Reddish hasn't been really good. DeAndre Hunters been. Okay, you know, I think he's a solid Roll player, but you know unless Kevin herders is Klay Thompson, then you know, I think they have a superstar in tray young and then they have a couple decent role players, but I think their bench just isn't very good Jabbar. He's been a pleasant surprise. I will say that he's got himself in shape and as plain as active rolling five man, you know, really diving hard finishing strong at The Rim that's been good to see you know, I just think they basically Need trade ask or 35-40 every night to win games. And you know, I think that's going to be hard to sustain as great as he is and you know, he is he's very great. But you know, I still wouldn't make a huge just meant I said 33 wins, you know, I still think they hover around that Philadelphia has started well to know their issue also to me I think is depth related. You know, you see Brett Brown playing a whole bunch of backup point guards Off the Bench which shows me he doesn't really believe all that strongly in any any single one just yet. You know Josh Richardson's played. Well, I like, you know, how he can kind of handle it as a backup point guard a little bit when Simmons out of the game-winning with Adam bead obviously was was pretty impressive, you know, the rookie Matisse has really good Defender and is played well, but again, I just think they I know that they have a really good starting five, but they do have some fit issues obviously and have to figure out who they want to finish close games with, you know as playing that such a big lineup at the end of a game can pose a challenge. So I'm still you know, I still think people are way too high on them. I don't think they're in the same tier as I say Milwaukee. I think they're in that second tier, you know with With Miami potentially with Austin potentially, you know, I think they're really good, but I'm not overreacting to two wins to start the season for them Boston two and one been really impressed with them. You know, Kemba obviously is great and fits in great as a brad Stevens type player. I think they're back, you know, trying to re-establish an identity as a greedy, too. Nosed defensive team and you know in their two wins, they held the Raptors to 106 the next 295. You know, Philly they lost to Philly opening night gave up 107 but I think they're going to be a team that that you know hang their hat on defense. I think obviously they have a whole lot of bodies and and Williams and you know, semi and Jalen Brown Tatum Marcus Smart, obviously, you know, Grant Williams bunch of guys with that kind of Mindset and identity I think you know the issue obviously is just the Five Spot pretty pretty darn thin there, especially when canners out I liked ice but he's ideally you know it a 15-minute a game guy. You know, I think if they could send my trade for for a really solid five or find somebody out there at least until Robert Williams is really ready to step up, you know might limit them a little bit but I You think you know think it really surprised a lot of people this season I think 50 wins or something around that, you know isn't out of the question. I think like I said, I think they're at that top tier of the East and I think Brad Stevens is a terrific coach Toronto starting 2 and 1/2 really good wins against the Pelicans and bowls siakam is a stud. I did a YouTube video If you haven't seen I think He's going to get MVP votes this season. I think he's he's a poor man's yanis he but he can shoot too. He can post up he can dribble the ball full core. You can pass, you know, he's got some moves off the dribble. He can roll he can handle and pick-and-rolls. He's got a whole bunch of stuff to his game Fred Van Fleet is has made another leap. He's just so funny. Only solid and has improved so much in this time in the league just such a worker, you know, so I might have underestimated them. I said they weren't going to make the playoffs. I still think, you know, unless siakam. Like I said can really take that leap to an MVP guy the season, you know, they're they're going to have some nights where they really struggle, you know to score a hundred six against Boston. I think they're going to have some some down scoring nights they again, Then don't have a ton of depth Nick nurse clearly. He's not happy with with their offseason acquisitions and hollis-jefferson and Stanley Johnson, but you know, they do still have a really solid at least core five starting five and you know siakam can score 25 30 if OG can continue to play well and you know really make an improvement all offensively, you know, then for sure they'll stay around the the top of the East But you know, I do think they need a little more at least scoring help for sure. Miami has been awesome to watch without even without Jimmy. I love I love bam. I love Tyler here. Oh, I love Kendrick none as a rookie if you haven't seen him yet. Make sure you check him out. He's got a tremendous amount of confidence, you know Big Time shooter big-time floater. I love how they have. Olynyk and Leonard are there stretch bigs? They have Derek Jones and Bam to dive, you know, they keep the floor space with one of those stretch bigs the other big roles hard every single time, you know, they surround it with Justice handling some they surround it with Goron Off the Bench as been terrific, you know, he's been around so long and his hidden shots really really well. When they get obviously their Max guy back in Jimmy, I think he'll fit in perfectly and be a perfect so player hopefully James Johnson, maybe Dion if he doesn't mess things up can can give them something this year off the bench. You know, I think Duncan Robinson's a pleasant surprise. He's he looks like an NBA player. I mean, he's a good piece Off the Bench can move around all screens. Shoot really good. I work really fundamentally sound Miami, you know, they really defend the gritty and that's how I spoke coaches, you know, a lot of guys with a chip on their shoulder, you know, holding it down again until until Jimmy's back and then I think he really gets them over the hump, but they even without him. I mean they've got a team that's really fun to watch, you know, just wonder you know how exactly the rotation changes it's hard, you know when you start to and one and have some really good. Names and then have to integrate back on your star. You know, does that mean you know Meyers Leonard, I guess probably goes to the bench. But you know, like I said suppose had a good thing going with playing one of Leonard or Olynyk at all times keeping the floor space that way, you know, so it is a new challenge when Jimmy comes back but I would think they'll be able to work come in just fine Cleveland beating Indiana shocked me. You know I said, I think they might win. In 10 15 games that I thought they're going to be really really bad this season, but it's a good reminder that you know, they still have some adults in the room, you know in love and Thompson's been balling out so far Matthew dellavedova, you know, John Henson, they have guys who've been around. I really like Darius Garland as a rookie, you know Sextons played pretty well, you know, but I think they'll hang around maybe the best case for there. Front office is to hang around and look pretty good in the first 10 15 games and you know, then I think maybe you can attract some trade value for your vets and you know, get some more assets and young pieces. I still think as a whole they'll be pretty terrible. But you know Garland is a great piece and you know, obviously love is still a really high level player and kind of sets the tone for the young guys and yeah the wind Randy was impressive but I you know, they've got a tough schedule coming up might be a while before they get that next one Orlando 101. Markel folks has been awesome to watch, you know, really cool seeing him play with a whole bunch of confidence again, you know attacking hard not being afraid to take a mid-range or even a three, you know, when he's left wide open, you know playing really really hard defensively. using that set the tone playing with great Pace offense ively pushing the ball attacking the basket, you know, obviously they've got a whole bunch of wingspan guys, I think for me though, you know, my biggest takeaway is I need more out of Aaron Gordon especially games like Atlanta which they lost you know, he's he needs to be a 20 25 a game guy this season, you know, I just know he's been he's been good overall is analytics or solid he's certainly Good player in the league but every time I watch him, I just come away thinking there's there's something more, you know, there's there's a whole bunch of talent and I always think there's there's a little bit more that you know can be pulled out of him. You know, he's had a pretty very quiet start to this season and you know who bounced back but I need to see him more in an attack mindset killer mentality, you know, he needs to be there. They're Guy on a lot of nights and I think he kind of has a tendency to defer and let you know they've got Fournier. They've got vouched. I've got Isaac, you know, they've got pieces but I think for them to be their best version Aaron Gordon needs to be you know, not only just a solid to way guys. I think he needs to take a step up all fensively really get going Milwaukee lost to Miami at home was really disappointing. They really blew that. Game choke that game away. Also disappointing to me is just seeing them not really change how they're playing at all. They're still really really predictable. You know, they play that five outset pretty much every time they don't run hardly any plays, you know, makes it really easy just to load up Miami just got basically, you know Five Guys in the paint and showed Jana so wall and you know, he Rove when he could kicked it out to spot Shooters when he could but they just you know, Wes Matthews Brook. Even Robin now just Chuck's threes George Hill, you know, they just space the floor and honest Clauses Forces help kicks out for three is don't run any other sets allergic to taking mid-range jumpers and I think they're just predictable, you know, there's still like I said, they'll be the best team in the East I think, you know, I This is that good but I think they need to change up how they play a little bit the same way Houston gets that criticism for being easy to guard and just you know playing that that same way every single time. I think, you know, they need to execute be able to run some things and not just rely on yanis getting the pain every time and kicking out the shooters Wes Matthews took some some really wild shots. Robin did like I Said, you know, I think they they need to switch up the style a little bit, but, you know watching you honest. You know, he's not he's not shooting the ball very well just two games obviously, but you know, I still just you know, I don't really like that. He's taking a whole bunch of Threes. I'd like to see him, you know dribbling occasionally Rise Up from the elbows Elevate over guys, which he obviously can do. You know, I think they're they're playing hardcore analytic ball over will work to an extent especially in the regular season, but is it good enough to To get you over the hump in the playoffs remains to be seen Kyle Korver has been really good for them. You know how he they were able to slide him in there. So cheap was was a great find he's a but player he still can shoot the heck out of it. You know, they have a pretty deep team. I need to see a little more from you know, Dante T Vincenzo, you know Sterling Brown some of the young guys Pat connaughton. I I think you know some of those guys can still step up and make a little leap and you know blowing that game to Miami was was not good. But I think they'll they'll start to see some really strong Charlotte. Obviously guy. Everybody's been talking about PJ Washington shooting the absolute heck out of the bowl, you know miles Bridges has been good Dwayne Bacon's had good moments, you know, I think Borrego has them as I'm Think hard, you know, they're super super hyung team. I can't believe bismack biyombo. I every offseason forget. He's still in the NBA and then I see he, you know started a game for them. You know, I think yeah, there's going to be a whole bunch of growing pains. They might only win 10 15 games when it's all said and done but Bridges has improved PJ's really solid, you know. Terry I've said I'm high on Devonte Graham obviously had a huge first game Off the Bench, you know, so maybe they surprised sorry second game for gram. Maybe they surprise a few people myself included. But yeah, I think overall, you know vets win in this league. They don't have enough of them, you know with with Batum and you know, mkg, you know Rosie tomorrow. Williams they have a couple guys but you know the focal points of that team or their youth you know, which they have to rely way too much on at this point in their career. So it's obviously developmental year for Charlotte. You know, I think you just need to figure out who can really play who's going to be a really good piece. You know, they have a lot of those guys have a lot of confidence. So, you know, I their NBA players don't expect them to back down. down from anybody, you know when you have guys that believe in themselves as much as regehr does and you know, Washington does and bridges clearly, you know, all those guys, you know, they'll be competitive in some games but macro big picture probably not going to go as well Chicago one and two hasn't had a phenomenal start, you know fans are freaking out shouldn't have lost that game in Our let's open the season, you know Toronto still a really good team obviously, but they, you know could have been a lot more competitive in that game. You know, I think they're seeing the the reasons that I ran ski why there was even a starting point guard competition was set around see solid, but he just he loses his confidence in his shot a lot and that's happened, you know a lot so far through three games, you know, I think Market in is spin up and down and struggling like a young player does you know hasn't found the consistency that he needs every night. Kristen's been good Off the Bench, you know playing his role really defending obviously doesn't do much scoring Colby white does some scoring doesn't do some so much passing, you know, so it's just an imperfect team the with a lot of guys who you know, I think don't know exactly what their roles are just yet. You know, I think boy One, like I said, I've been a fan of his and I think he's done a good job getting them to play harder and try to establish an identity as defensive team. But yeah, you know that requires then guys understand that the Levine and Market in an auto or the main guys all offensively and you know Kobe obviously Off the Bench and everybody else, you know has to really buy into being a Defender and doing their job and you know letting those guys go to work offensive. Ali you know, haven't that young is the adults in the room and a couple of the other, you know Arch and auto obviously the Vets will be good for them. So, you know way too early to overreact on Chicago. I think they'll be just fine. I think they'll you know compete for that eight seed which is all all you can ask at this stage in their development. So fans can can take a deep breath and I think they'll they'll be all right. And right there in the long run Brooklyn one and two not good enough, you know losing to Memphis not really acceptable, you know, losing a Minnesota. They look a lot better but probably shouldn't have lost that game at home either to open the season, you know, and to me I get all these these Kyrie stands furious at me for posting a single clip of him. You know not being good defensively with a minute 30 left in overtime and people say now post the clips of you know him playing great defense after that which he played good defense after that or you know, you're nitpicking you're you're doing what people did about LeBron know to me. I think people tried to paint Lebron as a poor Defender went a lot of times. They didn't even understand what was going on in the clips or how the clips weren't really LeBrons fault, you know, Somebody else didn't do their job, you know, Kyrie obviously is we know he can score the ball. He's continued to do a phenomenal job of that, you know, but the question is is he going to Bear down and make winning plays and in overtime 1:30 left up to rough three, whatever was you know, just flying a poor shooting Solomon Hill off the three-point line and you know, No, just just jumping for no reason and giving no effort to get back in. The play isn't good enough. It just isn't a winning play, you know, and that was kind of that was an issue obviously in Boston and in the playoffs in particular and you know, if you're going to be the guy if you're going to have the house of highlights and bleacher report's freak out every single time. You have a nice dribbling move and finish up the basket. You need to remember the Leti that comes with with being a superstar the max guy requires you to be a two-way player and to do it on both ends night in night out, you know until obviously KD maybe next season gets back. They need Kyrie data set the tone and be a leader and that's just not what leaders do you know? So yes, he's done a great job scoring like he always always has he looks really good on that end, but I need to see Kyrie give more effort on the defensive end for me to really really by what Brooklyn's doing. So Detroit one and two obviously been missing Blake. You know, Derrick Rose is still looks like he's found that magical Fountain of Youth Off the Bench, you know, he's I think people get mad why he's not starting at times. But you know if you can only do it for 20 Five minutes, it's hard to start a guy like that. I think he's comfortable in his role Off. The Bench. Tim Frazier is is not a good starting point guard at all or really a point guard even kind of worthy of a roster spot in my opinion. I feel like they'll look to do better than that if Reggie or anybody has to miss extended time, but you know canards been going good Off the Bench, you know Snell is This is up and down as he always is Andre I think is has looked like a much more committed player. So far Bruce Brown is a gritty guy. I'd like, you know in that lineup is going to really defend, you know, I think they have the pieces around Blake to really surprise some people this year and you know when 45 or 50 or so, I think case he's a really good coach, you know, so they just they need to get Of the we need to stay together Reggie when watching a little Reggie Jackson II think he's in good shape this year. I think he you know has been much maligned obviously and probably rightfully so at times, you know, but watching him in the preseason, I think he's you know, Casey's got him a little more bought in he's she looks like he's really playing defense. He's playing hard, you know, obviously making shots and giving them something offensively as more the question mark, but yeah, I think Christian Wood is really exciting Off the Bench. He plays really hard and just super freakishly talented. So still really high on Detroit obviously need Blake to get back. But yeah, the they'll be they'll be solid this year the Wizards won in Sioux, you know bread obviously is the guy andrewy has really impressed me. Burton's shoots the living crap out of the bowl Isaiah had a good game off the bench that was good to see Thomas Brian's a lot better than a lot of people realize, you know, the again, they're competitive. It's just you know, they might only be eight or nine deep, you know, Bongos has had some good moments, but he's just not not a starting three, you know, I think they're having to rely at unruly and he's been really Good. Like I said, he's a lot better than people thought he absolutely can defend. He's really solid in the mid-range. He's even proven that he can he can make some threes. He plays hard he rebounds he runs the floor. He's got a good IQ to me. You know, I think yeah, it's just it's a really thin team, you know, they lack second Superstar at least for now, you know and bread can only Only take them so far but they've been competitive and you know, I Brad is he's a he's a competitor. That's what he's gonna do for them every night. As long as he's playing he's going to go out there and give his all and compete and be one of the best two-way players in the league, you know, really work on defense run some offense obviously through him handling the ball, you know, obviously shooting. He's he always starts assist the season a little cold, but he'll really we warm up and get going. So yeah, you know the Wizards it's going to be a long year for them. But rui is a really good piece Thomas Brian's looking like a really good piece, you know, the it's about figuring out who who was part of that that team next year with John hopefully back and Brad, you know and Thomas Bryant rui, you know, that's a solid four right there who else can complement that as a starter off the bench figuring out. The three position sign mellow maybe, you know, they've got some things to figure out but an encouraging start to the season not encouraging the Pacers, you know, really struggled losing to in Cleveland not good, you know, obviously they need all the depot to come back before a lot of people thought he would you know not yeah, I might maybe I've been too high on them. You know, I I still really like Brogdon there. I like sabonis and Turner, even though they you know still don't seem to really know perfectly how to how to play together TJ McConnell, you know didn't do much in the last game and leaf kind of still doesn't seem to figure it out. You know, they need a lot of guys to step up. You know, Mike D'Antoni old quote. Somebody nobody knows has to ask Step up today or shine today or something like that. You know, they have a lot of guys who haven't really made a big name for themselves in the league yet Off the Bench Sumner starting at times, you know, they yeah, it's going to be hold down the fort until Vic gets back. But you know looking coming up. They've got the Troy Brooklyn Cleveland Chicago Charlotte the Wizards plenty of time to to turn it around and you know, I'd say at least hover, you know be around 500. Hopefully Vic comes back, you know again earlier than people thought couple months less maybe if he doesn't, you know, then it's scratch and Claw just for a playoff spot, but I do think with him, you know with him with Warren with lamb Brogdon, you know with the bigs. I think they're you know as deep of a team as a lot of teams. Yeast I think their gritty I like Nate as a coach a lot. And yeah, I think still really early but the got up got to find a way to get some wins like the Knicks. Oh and three to start, you know, Boston not super competitive Brooklyn. They were competitive Spurs, you know, hung around for a decent portion of the game, you know physics has them competing. But yeah now we've gotta turn that into some wins RJ obviously as been as been really good, you know, that's very encouraging to see because work with your handle and I think clearly paying off Drew's one of the best development coaches in the league RJ's, you know shot that has been a lot better than people thought it would be at this point, you know Randall as been good. I think, you know the issue just remains that they don't really have a point guard. You know Alfred is is a Defender and doesn't things and you know, Dennis obviously was going through the personal thing I guess but you know just just didn't really give them anything and Frank fact that they still won't throw them out there. I think just again confirms that the Fizz just has no trust in him. And you know, I think again, he just doesn't see Frank being able to make shots and you know to handle the pressures of being appointed. Gar, when teams go under every single screen you have to make them pay by making some shots and you know, obviously if Alfred and Dennis continue to not do that either, you know, then Frank's going to have to get his shot by necessity. But yeah, it's pretty amazing. They have three, you know young guys were all high picks and have a ton of potential in this league. But you know right now it just doesn't seem like they really have any NBA starting point guard. Makes it really hard to win games. Despite. Despite how well RJ plays. It's like Marcus Morris playing pretty well, despite Mitch, you know giving them good minutes. So, you know, they've been grittier. But again you can you make that leap to figuring out how to win games. Oh and three not a good start looking coming up Chicago Orlando Boston Sacramento Detroit Dallas, you know, it's there. Is winnable games there got it. Got to find a way to sneak some in there, especially the close ones because the next thing you know, you know, you'll be 2 and 14 or 15 again and you know, the things will be despondent pretty quickly got to turn around speaking of turnarounds, Minnesota or Ryan Saunders done a great great job starts season, that is a fun team to watch if you haven't yet check them out lead pass wherever you can. You know the Boston last night against Miami Miami team who I talked about and love, you know cat bold out in the first half Wiggins balled out in the second half was way too early to write him off despite his inefficiency despite his struggles, you know, he's super young earned the max contract for a reason still a tremendous amount of talent there. I tried Graham plays great defense of kogi plays great defense. Since Covington plays great defense and hits threes. You know Layman's decent Off the Bench Napier's decent Off the Bench Von Lisbon. I don't understand how the Knicks why the next just let him go. You know, they said they you know, they have cat obviously as the guy offensively, you know, I think they have to figure out if Wiggins can still kind of be that that second guy, but you know, I like Covington obviously is has huge. Angel is defensive player of the year type guy, you know grams really gritty and you know, like I said the guys off the bench Ryan Saunders has everybody really understanding their role guys know the offense going to be through cat. Andrew will get his when he can you know other guys T groans A Team a little bit cause of me, you know hit shots Shabazz can come in be aggressive Off the Bench, but you know, they know everybody seems to understand what's expected. The them Culver hasn't been great, you know, but he's had some good moments. He's had some flashes. You know, I think talk again in 10 15 games about him. Give him a little time. He's he's very raw obviously, but you know still still really high on him. And yeah, I think Minnesota I certainly could have been wrong about them. Especially if Wiggins, you know continues to really give them something then Yeah. Yeah, I think Minnesota can absolutely compete for a playoff spot. This season towns couldn't compete for an MVP if he keeps this up and yeah, I think you know, they have the right right amount of defensive players around cat this season to make things a lot easier for him. San Antonio continues to be as well coached as ever maybe the best, you know, well definitely the best all-time in the league. You know beat the Knicks the Wizards gets a lot tougher from here Portland Clippers. You know, how do you do in those ones remains to be seen But Murray looks great plays with phenomenal Pace really defends can score more than I thought can play make more than I thought, you know Eddie obviously, this is huge Off. The Bench Isles has done a couple things as shown me a little something. You know that there's clearly Talent there. The the Papas is working to unlock their quite Lonnie Walker. You know, they have a lot of bodies a lot of guys who play really hard, you know, they play their same way and you know again solid as ever when hover around 50 games like pop always does and you know, they're they're they're going to be right there near the top of the West Denver I notably You know was not huge on but you know a good start to the season for them. You know, yoga job obviously is the guy I think the question is who's the second guy? You know, I think Jamal Murray is the obvious answer but you know, he needs to make a little leap again, you know, he's been really good, but there is career and make taking little jumps every season, but he needs to make a pretty Significant significant one this year same with Gary Harris, you know, I think my concerns still with them remains Millsaps kind of falling off a little bit or hitting kind of a little veteran wall. You know, we'll see jury's still out on that hasn't been you know, hugely productive so far, but Jeremy Grant the big addition Off the Bench Torrey Craig is a heck of the defender and you know had a huge. Block on Booker to to win the game against Phoenix Malik Beasley can shoot you can play defense. My Morris is a solid backup point guard team, you know, they're just there's a lot across the board. You know, I think again, it's to me it's just about every team in the west, you know, even the Spurs have Lamarcus and the rose and you know, pretty much all the teams at the top have have two stars. I think yoga just clearly is star. Are you know and Jamal Murray clearly has that capability. We just need to see it every night from him not just on occasion stroke Phoenix two and one really good impressive start for them to really like what I've seen Monty Williams has done a great job there so far, you know book obviously is fantastic Kaminsky Off the Bench as been really good and makes it a little little mind-boggling. Why he didn't play last year in Charlotte, you know, I think Javon Carter is a heck of a Defender really gritty having a real point guard in Rubio obviously helps having a you know, a big in Danes veteran obviously helps losing Aiden for something stupid does not help can't be taking diuretics. He knew what he was putting his body not good. Sorry, which is gritty really gritty guy. 15 and 10 Uber a gave him 20, you know Tyler Johnson has been solid Off. The Bench Bridge has been solid Off the Bench, you know, they've got they've got pieces to be competitive and you know, both of those struggles, especially if Aiden's suspension is upheld, you know, they have to hold down the fort without him, but, you know been really competitive, you know in just about every game to start the season Them and I think yeah, they can make a huge leap 35 40 wins, you know Monty has them again playing really good ball really impressive. Like I said knocked off the clippers, but still not much reason to be concerned. They're specially while George comes back, you know similar to what I talked about in Miami. They do a great job, you know her L Zu Bots, you know, they do the rolling. Patrick Patterson jamychal Green Space the floor phenomenally. Well Patrick Beverley obviously is a pitbull Kauai, you know is the best player in the league right now Landry sham. It's a bunch player that but she's me bunch better than a whole bunch of people thought. You know Lou is Lou obviously he's gotten so much better as a password. You just be able to go left only to shoot now. We can go right to shoot or pass just picks people apart in the pick-and-roll in the two-man game harkless looks real It Off the Bench playing with the tremendous amount of energy, you know, Doc is an amazing coach. So yeah, the they might win 60 65 if George comes back reasonably soon, you know, they're going to be really really good Portland snuck out when in Dallas last night, you know, they yeah, I think they're they're still right there. They're cunning that Denver group to me, you know, love Dame love CJ, obviously, I think the question just is you know again the Clippers, Utah. You know the Lakers so many teams made this this big leap, you know, did Portland do enough to keep Pace remains to be seen, you know, I think they're relying on the development of a guy young guy like Simmons this season, you know, there was a relying on Zack Collins to really improve and make a jump. You know, I think they you know, they need white side obviously to hold down the fort until nerd gets back. You know, but we know what them they're going to play hard every night, you know that they clearly have those two stars, you know, the Rodney Hood continues to look good for them. And you know is the most more underpaid players in the league. Yeah, every reason to still be optimistic about their growth, you know, that they've been there since they know what they're doing. They've you know, they've got a wild Figure things out. But what they don't have you know is the flexibility that some teams will have like like the Clippers, you know, Glide needs some load management, you know, you can afford to be without George for a while Portland needs, you know, they need Damon CJ to play just about every game, you know, which is taxing is a big load on those guys, you know, the Lakers, you know a DI, it's funny. You know, you hear people Talk to people who watch the Pelicans and you know, they would tell you that ad wasn't all that good in the post. And then you see him with the Lakers. He's just killing guys from the left block, you know shows you fans or the Synergy numbers, you know, just as a lot of bias, you know or people that don't really know what they're watching ad is a heck of a poster vocals going to be committed to pounding and pounding the ball down there through Ooh him through LeBron down in the post as well. Avery Bradley looks good. Gritty as ever defensively in good shape all offensively giving them a little jolt there. Troy Daniels Dudley obviously can make shots white looks good, you know travail look competent. I think Rondo, you know will help Quinn cook just shies away from the moment a little bit too much for me Cruz has been good. He does not try it. He's got he's got Swagger. Danny Green is fit in perfectly. So, you know, it's a process to figure out their exact identity. But yeah, they're going to be just fine with with Ron Nady and the pieces around them and obviously, you know getting because back will be huge, you know, and I think you know that third piece kind of determines how far they can go but you know, they surrounded the roster with with vets Danny like Bradley and you know guys who can really play and I think they'll be you know, one of the best teams in the west All Season Utah's is somehow emerged two and one despite Conley's brutal shooting slump at times, you know, Quin Snyder proven why he's one of the best coaches in the league even without You know bogdanovich at times Royce O'Neill is an X-Factor for them. He was the guy somebody with Utah told me is just really going to break out there. They're really high on him. You know, I think Donovan doesn't need a score 30 every game anymore. Just great more balanced Jeff Green Off the Bench Moody Off the Bench Ingles Off the Bench, obviously Ed Davis, you know, they deep team really well coached team. Team, they play together is my point they you know, it's not about any one guy. It's Rudy being a superstar defensively Donovan getting most of the points offensive ly Mike Conley being the veteran bogdanovich giving them, you know big scoring punch when needed just really solid across the board Dallas has had a good start 2 & 1, you know wins over the Pelicans and wizards lost to the Blazers Luca and kp2 They're obviously look really darn good. You know question is just who else is with them? You know, I think they yeah clearly don't have a third banana that might not even have five stop solid starters. I like the line, right? But yeah aside from that, you know, Seth Curry is a bench piece. It's pretty limited pretty slim pickings just have not done a good job filling out that roster, you know, and I think that That will be why they why they don't make the playoffs. But if I'm wrong if Carlisle, you know can really get the rest of those guys to outperform and be solid compliments to Luke and KP. I might very well be wrong Houston talking about struggling defensively. Well, maybe that's why you shouldn't have fired your entire defensive coaching staff that held one of the best defenses of the past couple of years that nearly knocked off Golden State Which F is delek. And a really good defensive scheme getting rid of all those guys made no sense. No disrespect else in turn. But yeah, just nonsensical, you know Russ's has been really good Harden's been struggling obviously, but he'll be fine. You know, they they have enough they're clearly to win. They'll be a top four seed ultimately all the narrative with them is going to be about the playoffs. That's just the way it is. So, you know if Harden has to Pace himself a little bit more and kind of float through most of the regular season as long as they you know, still the top four or five sixteen, you know, and if he's saving more in the tank to go all out in the playoffs and what Russ do a little bit more of this regular season fine, you know, I as we know nobody cares about the MVPs or how many 50-point games Harden has or still going to trash him until he gets over the hump in the playoffs. It's stupid. It's Out of but it is also the culture and you know, it's about rings and winning and so on and so forth. So yeah talk to me in five or six months, Oklahoma City big win over the Golden State Warriors who everybody is in full-on panic mode about you know, Oklahoma City competitive against the Wizards against Utah. They were no into T home against Golden State, you know, and everybody says, Is talking about how terrible they are and you know, they're probably not very good. But they have pride everybody in the NBA a lot of Pride they came out, you know punched Golden State in the in the mouth yesterday. Shy looks really good proven me wrong so far. He might be a lot better than I thought having Chris Paul there to Mentor him obviously helps, you know, people forget so is much about your situation and your surroundings as it is about as about your abilities. you know Gallinari is still terrific first has been good, you know Adams, I think hopefully they can maybe trade a couple of these pieces, you know, because it's still going to be a long 25 30 something Men season, you know, Chris Paul still way up there in age, but still is heavy as ever and as good of a vet presence as you can have so yeah, we definitely expect Them to compete as long as they have him and the do things the right way and Billy Dee's solid coach Taylor Jenkins solid coaches. Well, I had a good start huge win against Brooklyn last night ja terrific obviously, you know, like the way they play fun to watch, you know fun. Sorry blank. And for a second look. Yeah, just a competitive roster across the board everybody. That's out there plays hard. Jae Crowder plays tenaciously hard Clark's look good. You know Bruno's a good piece Jen's veteran Brooks can really score Jackson, you know obviously is going to be a really really good player in this league. I wonder if maybe they can talk iguodala's back into into showing up and you know being a part of Team, that's fun and competitive because I think he can make them, you know whole lot better and you know, probably still not going to the playoffs or anything like that. But you know, they can win 30 35 games. You know Jaws is like I said, I think he's maybe the best pure passing point guard from day one. He's got phenomenal feel for the game. He's proven he can score better than I thought even he's a, you know, had a huge defensive play against Kyrie. She sent over time so going to be special. They're going to be fine, you know growing year obviously, but a fun really fun team to watch not fun to watch so far Golden State reminder though their own to relax too long season. Okay starting to guys in Chris and Glenn Robinson who nearly were out of the league, you know, Chris could have easily floated overseas Robinson didn't have a lot of This offseason both those guys are starting their beds made up of no names and rookies and you know, God knows who yes, they still have stars and Stephen D'Angelo and Draymond and they should be playing better than this. But anytime you have to you know, integrate like six guys in your rotation from absolute scratch. There's going to be growing pains. I still think they're going to make the playoffs. I still think give it at least 10 15 18 games before we're in full on freakout mode losing to Oklahoma City who are owing to at home not unforgivable. They were more competitive against the Clippers in the first game. There's plenty of time all the people freaking out about Steve Kerr don't know what they're talking about. There's a reason why he doesn't run Steph Curry and 60 pick and rolls every game reason is his body type is ability to see things more than just the first pass when I That is yes Steph Synergy analytics, whatever they ran a lot of pick-and-roll and his MVP season. He'll still run plenty of pick-and-roll. But his thing is he's small. So when you rotate over if the Trap stuff in the pic of hole and then you rotate over and take away that first pass a to Dream On he has a hard time seeing over seven Footers and making those skip jump skip passes against a trap to the corner and even if he does make that pass, it's Glenn Robinson over there. It's not a guy with a whole lot of confidence. They know they're leaving. There's a reason why he's not Steve Kerr's not an idiot. Okay, there's no magical ski most importantly in the NBA. It's not about X's and O's it's about Jules and Jose. They don't have the Personnel right now any system, whatever system you want to play first of all starts with playing hard playing harder playing together learning each other. They have more than most beautiful offensive systems and of all time with Draymond passing the ball with stuff. Flying off screens doing everything obviously harder when you lose not only your superstar in KD, but the other Superstar you were still do have on your team and Klay Thompson. They're severely undermanned right now. Hang in there level the survive the storm, you know, give it a little bit of time. I think they'll be okay, but you know that they were killing Steve Kerr even when they win championships and win 60 games. So the noise levels at an all-time. I'm high. I just have to tune it out find a way to grind out a few wins speaking of grinding out some wins desperate for winds at this point New Orleans Sacramento narrative about Pelicans much better. Obviously without Zion, you know that they've still been really competitive lonzo's been pretty good. Ingram's been really good Alexander Walker, you know, the heart's been solid Off the Bench You know, I think they yeah, they're right there that you have every reason to be encouraged about that team. But you know, you look science going to be out a couple months. So, you know, there's got to be a sense of urgency. You have to just find a way to win some games. Whatever your recipe is for doing that if it's in Ingram scoring 30, 35 points, you know, then do that if it's you know Lonzo spread the getting everybody involved if it's true being more aggressive. You know if it's given JJ go to a little bit more Alvin Gentry just has to find a way to get them some some early wins before, you know, Season really slips away from them because I do still think you know that they can they can hover around 500 hover around competition for the eighth seed. But yeah movement losing Zion obviously was was a big blow to that and makes things a whole lot harder Sacramento. Yeah. I crushed them on Twitter the other day. Because firing Dave Yeager just made no sense, you know to take that team 39 whatever they won last season when most people thought they would win 20 before the season was incredibly impressive Luke Walton like KD tweeted at me. Yes still a young coach in the league still has time to figure out maybe he figures it out in Sacramento, but you know to me he's not he's not but he's not suppose not Brad Stevens, you know, he Not a coach that's worth firing your coach for I think Sacramento still did they signed some vets and Ariza? Dedmon, Cory Joseph but you know the Stars everybody on the team is Young, you know Fox Bagley, you know bogdanovich complaining about his role. Apparently, you know, there's a lot of guys who aren't fully bought into winning and doing what it takes Yeager. I thought was a disciplinarian held guys accountable was was tough on Them, you know and Luke so far has not you know did not do that in La you know as not done a good job in his first three games in Sacramento obviously early plenty of time to figure it out. But yeah, you know, not not an encouraging start at all, especially to not even be competitive, you know, just getting absolutely smacked by Phoenix by Utah, you know looking Man up. They've got Denver. They've got the Hornets Utah the Knicks the Raptors the Hawks Blazers plenty of chances to get some wins in there. But you know clock's ticking. I think the leap for them. I predicted them to be in the 9 seat again. Like they were last year anything worse than that is a failure. You know, I think they're good enough to be in the playoffs. That should be the goal goal should be making the playoffs if they're worse than I thought if there. R regressed from last year that is not good for Vlad a for veck and the front office that continues to fire good coaches for no reason. So anyway, thank you guys very much for listening. I apologized early in the morning going through the whole league. I'm sure there's guys I missed things. I screwed up on tweet at me. Let me know where I was dumb, but appreciate you guys listening. We'll be back soon.

We are live. We are back here on the soapbox. This is episode. I think 11 or 12, which is pretty awesome. And I'm actually in a hotel traveling around for a CrossFit level 2 seminar. It was a super busy week, so I didn't get to record inNormal Abode, but I wanted to bring my stuff along with me and chat about some stuff. So. Last podcast we had I was with Paul Tremblay. We had a lot of good feedback on just barrier to entry that type of stuff. So really appreciate that on Buried entry to and across it affiliate this week. I'd like to switch gears a little bit and talk nutrition nutrition is it's a topic that most people don't like to talk about because it's kind of like religion and politics it brings up so much emotion, and it's really what I want to kind of talk about. That helped me a little back story on me and my life when it comes to nutrition. When I found CrossFit. I found CrossFit Journal issue 21, and with that I read the article which explains the zone and and then from there. I followed the zone to a tee. I weighed and measured food that I was just naturally eating sandwiches. So on and so forth that changed my life. It was unbelievable. my relationship with food changed so much after that and I quickly learned about quality of food because I could eat more of it. So when I was owning, you know, just normal food that I was eating. I learned that okay, well favorable unfavorable carbohydrates and as it was written in the in the in the cross of journalists, you're 21 at the time. It was super simple. It's like, all right. Well, are you have bread right a half a slice of bread is a block of carbohydrates. So if I have a sandwich that's four blocks carbohydrate. So why not just get rid of the bread and eat more fruits and vegetables and other things because I want to More food and that was my natural progression essentially into you know, you know, you could consider it paleo. I would almost consider it more like a you know, whole Natural Foods like we talked about the level on meats and vegetables nuts and seeds some fruit little starch and sugar and the reason why it's not you know, I don't know if I actually ever truly prescribed to the paleo diet the paleo diet, you know omission of grains Dairy and legumes and very very restrictive depending on the practitioner that you're thirstier you're learning from but the reality is whole natural foods naturally occurring absolutely having less processed and refined carbohydrates check and that really did change my life and I weighed and measured my food for about five years straight and never cheating. And for those of you that were around me at that time know that and I changed my life and I recommend everyone to do the Zone because of my experience and I know that seems like what does that mean? Well, I learned about food I learned about a relationship with food. I understood macro nutrients better protein carbohydrates and fats. I learned how to turn my body into a laboratory. It was super easy because it was a block system and it wasn't super complex. It wasn't super minut in the details and into what some of the stuff we're seeing nowadays now. I'm not saying the zone is the diet that works for everybody. I'm just saying it taught me something and I now use it and I use that. Base knowledge for everything that I do from a nutritional perspective. Can you go through that learning process without it? Of course, but coming from someone like myself who really had no scope or understanding but a goal it really helped me. So I definitely recommend it if you want to start to learn and go down that Journey but you know, is it hard? Yeah. Well crossfit's hard and we still do it because we know that hard work gets results. So yeah, you got to do a little more than nothing, but I don't think that's an excuse and you know if we're looking for that. Type of hey, like I just need I don't want to work hard, but I want to see results. You know, I understand nutrition is different than Fitness, but at some level it's like all right. Well, if you want to do 20% of what would be 100% effective you're going to get 20% of the results, which means you won't get as much results and you won't get there as faster, which is okay as long as you're aware of that but just be aware of that right? Well variance functionality and intensity isn't variance functionality and low in density is high intensity. And that intensity gets results. So if you go at low or moderate intensity, you'll get lower moderate results. No different with nutrition. So with that said what what I don't want to talk about is preached about a type of diet I want I want to talk about is I think a problem and infestation that we have in the nutritional world nowadays and I think it's a narrative. That is It's upsetting because I don't think anyone wants to do it. I just think it's how people We'll think it should be done. I don't think at the heart people are have mal-intent everything people have care and I've talked about this a lot. So what I mean by that is alright when someone is talking about a nutritional regiment or type of way to eat or whatever. It might be. what has been creeping into a lot of presentations creeping into a lot of narrative out there is eat this way because the other ways are stupid eat in my way because the other way will kill the environment will you know, kill you whatever it might be so my way or whatever way I'm talking about I'm not going to talk about the health benefits of then how about the negative effects of the other ways so essentially vilifying other types of Foods nutritional programs diets. What have you over highlighting the benefits of whatever style of nutrition we're talking about and I really think this is a problem because I don't think we should be doing that type of stuff. So for example, right take the the vegetarian or vegan. World because it's a world that I think is very interesting. I'm not a vegetarian or vegan. I have a lot of friends that are I know a lot of people that are I know a lot of people that were registering for 20-30 years and have changed and I've spoken to some of the most educated people in the world, which is not me on this topic and it's interesting because putting everything aside I do notice that a lot of the you know, why do I eat this way? Well, and unfortunately I've been I've heard this I've seen it's like well, I don't eat meat or I'm a vegan because of what meat does to you or what these other thing? It's a very negative based as opposed to what I would really love to hear from specifically that Community but others is what are the benefits of a plant-based diet. That's what I want to hear. I don't want to hear the negatives of other diets. I want to hear the Fitz of that diet which I know there are benefits and their office also shortcomings and yeah, let's not also as every there's no perfect fit right the fact that we think that one size fits on everyone should do something is ridiculous. So like there's always pros and cons but it's got to work for you. Right? So what is the narrative that I want changing guys? This can be a simple Concept in a simple episode is Art. What are the benefits of eating a plant-based diet? Diet, you know the micro nutrient content the fiber the you know, the real foods, whatever it might be like, you know what it can do for gut health, whatever. I want to hear. I want to see it. That's what I want to know. So if like hey guys, I want to bring awareness about this type of nutrition program because I'm passionate about it. I like it. It's something that I enjoy great. Tell me what's good about it. What I would rather not hear is what's negative. And so then I did some self-reflection talking to people. It's like, all right. Well, how how I- about other things and I think that okay, you know. All right special interest groups, right? Well any special interest group has a special interest in whatever they have a special interest in and therefore relatively biased if you think that you're right, you're right, right. So the good thing is is I was like I well I think I vilified sugar for sure. I vilified processed sugar. It's not good for you. We should stay away from it. But what's funny and I so I was like, you're right. I have done that. I that's the one thing I have. so I guess my thought process is does that unify across almost all rational nutrition programs and what I mean by that is site from veganism to vegetarianism to you know, the raw meat diet, which I guess would be the other end of the Spectrum, which I know nothing about but and I'm not sure many people do to the Paleolithic diet to zoning to intermittent fasting to the ketogenic diet, you know to you know, you know anabolic fasting to Purification unit but let's go. We got this forever. I'd pretty much across the board. That is one thing. Everyone agrees on sugar is something we should stay away from it's not that we want you to never have cake or enjoy things. We just realized it's a treat it is something that is that yeah. It tastes really good. And if we end it's something that we know we shouldn't be it's not really necessary for survival. We know that it adds really no nutrient value. Other than that empty calories that it provides but it tastes Great, and it's there's there's there's nothing wrong with that other than the fact that unfortunately, it's Laden with in a lot of processed foods and it's masked and within a lot of processed foods and foods that are you know, not naturally occurring so that's something we need to be mindful of so I think that and again let's just pause there for a second to like food that's naturally occurring so like all right. Well, you have plants and vegetables and fruits and nuts and seeds and meats and all these things and all of the nutrition. Programs out there. I really do think so. All right. What do we agree on whole process unprocessed food Whole Foods. So yeah, are you don't want to eat me? All right. Well what we know the challenging to be Associated there you don't eat vegetables. We know this the the challenges Associated there, you know, but when it's all said and done, we're all really trying to fight the same fight. We want to put healthy fuel into our body now if you have a religious or if you have a moral value when it comes to something There's nothing wrong with that just you know, there's a little different purpose behind that and it's not as much nutritional. I can't speak to that too much because that's not something I'm I understand quite frankly to well. It's not something I'm involved with but there's nothing wrong with that because it's works for it allows it to work for you and your lifestyle right? But it's just another variable to way when your when your nutritional regiments I do caution. And here's my caution on any of this stuff because I've tried a lot of stuff guys have I really enjoy intermittent fasting now, you know, I've got, you know, I have never really truly done the ketogenic diet, but I understand it and I said I've eaten very clean for a long time. I've waited measure my food and different shapes or forms, but we need to be mindful of data that we see in studies that we see, you know it, you know the effects of you know, Cultivating on Farmland on things like that like the effects on the environment the effects on this or that like because it's and I tell you I don't know. I don't know here at here's the I don't know the answer because it's so overwhelming amount of information out there the amount of that I can read something like wow, this is amazing. I can watch a documentary on Netflix or whatever and be like, wow, this is 100% the way need to live my life. I need to change everything. You know, they said that there's a new movie out James Cameron directed that I haven't even seen yet. But you know, I mean, I'm sure it's Decorating no different than you know all the other movies and you know out there that you can heal sugar-coated and all these other things like wow, like you kind of go into this existential debate and I think that we just need to really look at where the studies are coming from. And what is a what is the study read it because when you read studies you're like and you have to nerd out on if you really going to go to the bank on this stuff. I don't know what you guys are reading. It's up to you guys, but really question everything. Ethan you're reading because it's correlation is not causation. Okay correlation is not causation which means we can't say if this then that if it's a coral it and and being able to derive causation is something that is very difficult to do we can take best practices and learn and understand that stuff. But I just wanted to get this off my chest keep this episode relatively short, but guys, let's stop. Bringing down other types of nutrition just leave with the Positive. Hey guys, I want you to learn about this this style of eating. I like it. I ate this way and this is the benefits that I see cool awesome, and I'm not talking bad about any other nutritional regiment. I'm just talking about this or it's it doesn't have to be negative about other things and I just it can be a simple conversation that way that you know, or are we all trying to be healthier people? Yeah, cool, then let's stop fighting about it. Now. The proof is also in the pudding. Let's let's get real. Right like I'm around a lot of people that are relatively fit and I see a lot of common denominators and it when I be fit when and here's the thing. efficacy matters I have the opportunity to be around some of the fittest people in the world and we're not talking the CrossFit Games athletes because I'm friends with those guys, but I'm talking, you know, just people that have been doing CrossFit for a decade and I know what they can physically do. I also know their health markers. I also know how they've handled, you know surgeries and injuries and setbacks and honestly across the board they all eat relatively the same. They really do they've tried different things and they're stored if they sat in front of Mike probably similar similar and wherever they're at. Most all of them eat meats and vegetables nuts and seeds some fruit little starch. No sugar. They've waited measure their food in some way shape or form their way of how much food they put into the body. They're clear that they want that clean Whole Foods, but they eat a spectrum of proteins. They eat nice different spectrum of vegetables and eat good healthy fats and they eat the right amounts and honestly, Those are the people that are the healthiest. I don't know their blood work is wonderful, and they get it tested because they're maniacs. It works and and the people that I respect the most that are within the nutritional field also have challenged and continually learn. I was go back to even Clara's and Kowski. I've you know, and I've had her on my on my YouTube Vlog and like it just you know, they anagram challenge is the most all-inclusive nutrition thing you could ever have because it's hey guys eat a hundred grams of fruits and vegetables a day and then from there fill in the gaps. It's the rest up to you and it's really cool because that's a really simple low-hanging fruit, but You know, it's very inclusive to every single human in the world yet because there's a lot of benefits to eating that type of stuff and she talks about those benefits and it's pretty cool stuff. So notice how it's not not no Mission diet. It's an inclusive diet and and again in a world where I think people are too sensitive. They're two emotional they take things too seriously or and they jump to conclusions too much about what works be mindful of this stuff. But like this notion of be inclusive be inclusive I get it. It but let's actually be clear of is your want for inclusivity actually being exclusive which is inappropriate. We want to make people healthier. We want to make people better. How do we do that B+ highlight things let's not vilify. Let's not put in a corner. Let's keep it super simple and just because you do something does not mean it's okay for other people, but you can talk about your experiences what you liked what you didn't like and if you are convicted for For some reason to something 100% solely and not willing to look at something else then usually your Viewpoint is flawed. Just be aware of that. Hey, I'm 100% invested in this because of this reason and that's okay. That's fine. Just be careful of pushing that on others if that's your reasoning. There's nothing wrong with that but we might not want to let that sort of overlay and others there. So again some nutrition stuff. Hopefully this stuff help you guys but let's let's just help our people out right caloric restriction Works eat less eat the right amount of foods, and and you're going to live long and happy gosh. I love it. Fasting I've been doing it and you know, it's like and I've loosened up the reins. I haven't been so maniacal about it. But yeah, like most of the time I'm fasting for 16 hours eating for eight my energies phenomenal works for me doesn't work for everyone. But like I finally found that Vibe and and I'm really enjoying it. So weekends are a little different than during the week. But you know, I really enjoy it and you know, that's where I'm at right now my nutritional Journey. Hopefully you guys can share some of your thoughts concerns comments, you know, hit me up. I law have this posted up on YouTube as well. Thank you guys. And we'll see you in the next episode.","– If you're looking to bulk up for your next workout, there's a new diet plan you may want to try. It's called the Zone, and it's designed for people who want to lose weight but don't want to go on a strict paleo-like diet, the New York Daily News reports. According to a press release, the Zone—which was first published in the CrossFit Journal in 2014—is designed to get people to their goal weight in less than two weeks. The main difference between the Zone and the paleo diet is that the paleo diet emphasizes whole, natural foods, while the Zone focuses on refined carbs and sugars, the Daily News reports.

Okay, so So today we're talking about a Colombian case have we ever done a calming case? I don't know. I don't think so because I've definitely started on some Colombian outlines. Like I have like mental notes about Colombian cases. And this was one of them but like I don't think so if done Venezuela, no, we don't many many. Yeah, I don't think maybe I should have sang Shakira then I feel very no no. Yeah. No, I think it was a good choice the song. Okay. Okay. Thank you. Mhm. So with Columbia, like I feel like I wanted to do something that is not drug related for like, you know, the first time Colombian case because like you search Latin American to cram you only get Pablo Escobar basically. Yeah Google so yeah, I mean Google is not a good thing. To keep finding cases for me especially. So today we're talking about Leanne acid who I mean this is a big case like this is recent history like, you know past like 10 years, I think case that like struck not only like the whole column you like the whole country, but you know, regionally, it's like I'm sure people are like still very upset about it and it's like the big big big One is every time something happens regards to a Twitter Twitter like explodes. So it's a huge one and we're tackling it today Oprah do it justice because it's huge. So this outline was based on articles by tobacco pulled Zoella Universal and a documentary by El rastro, which we definitely recommend for you guys to watch because I mean not only it's available on YouTube, but there you can listen To her parents friends and siblings talking about her you can watch footage of her like doing stuff is really cool. And you also can get more insight into like the case and evidence, etc. Etc. By investigators. You can hear the investigators talking about it. So that's really cool, you know always movie time with Suspiria we can watch the documentary so they get so Leah Patricia nasa.gov idea. Born on December 17th. 1983 instance Alejo Colombia. She had a huge personality. She was super quirky and friendly and honest her brother said that she would just like up and do stuff. She wouldn't think too much about what others would think of her when she was doing so she just like super spontaneous super fun and nice and fun to be around so she had a shit ton of friends. She was the oldest of three siblings and was super Super close to her family. She was 26 and she was attending the Universidad Del Norte anybody Kia for law actually, so she's almost at me. Yeah, and she was on very last semester, you know? No I because it said like she was on her very last semester just bummed me out. I feel like almost done with college. So she was working at the policy decision. Incense Alejo, so I don't know if you have to do that and us but stuff you should know it was doing like a residency med school buffer law school. So she was sick of working in the field before she was allowed to get her degree like so it's looser school. Yeah, you have like, yeah, you have to work during the Summers but I so she was gets like necessary. Sorry. I don't think it's like necessarily like I don't think you're obligated to do it in order to become a Here but by working every summer in law school. You have a better chance of Landing a job after you graduate. So yeah, yes full. Yeah, so but with her case really she was working. I don't know what she was doing there, but she was they refer to as practicing law. So she was probably getting some real hands-on experience at the policy that you see here, and it was I think don't quote me on. On that but it was I think it was mandatory for her graduation. There was a test after the judicial tutor. Yeah thing. So, yeah, she was like enough like at the end of that prepping for the test. So like the bar exam like be Brazil. Yeah, like and then after that she would I mean or base something that you do after you're done with school. I know you can do it but now or two because my best friend's fiancee he Go to law school in Brazil and he did our bit before he graduated. He passed the test that you're graduating. You're any good luck dude. Yeah, not everybody. Does that though? No not let this is clearly the smarter round says someone who doesn't know anything about nothing anyways, but with Leah, she was finishing up her lie since your Twitter, no, sorry. Yeah this institute and then no should be sure to the only since it to the Sorry, and after that she have a test and then after the test, she would graduate basically like I think she would have to finish the test and go like pass the test to graduate. So it's all like, you know sequence of events so in but that's in 2009. I'll go back to 2000 because we're talking about her anyway, so in 2003, she started dating one pop of the logos who sorry I keep saying who fucking aisle, so there are Kind of wrapped up in the relationship and decided they were going to get married pretty fast. I don't know how fast the relationship but they're mine was kind of made up and no one could tell them otherwise their family is approved of the relationship. Don't get me wrong, but they thought it was a bit too early for a wedding, but they got married anyways. Thanks, Joyce. Yeah, and their plan was to get pregnant. So Mary didn't get pregnant and ASAP and that's what happened because by 2004 they had a daughter they sound like me but when I was a teenager anyway, so after a few years their relationship wasn't the greatest The Clash a lot and fight and go on was growing distant since he traveled way too frequently for Work, of course as it turns out. He was really working something else working on something else doing the trips. Mmm sex. He was having an affair. She was devastated when she found out in two thousand seven ish. She divorced his ass, but it took a toll on her. She lost a ton of weight. It was really tough on her. So as with everything time goes by and she's able to you know, rebuild herself up and just like become a badass again. She went back to school changed her hair as we all do after a breakup. Everybody changes her hair. Even it's if it's a little bit and got a boob job. Now get this her and a surgeon Javier Gonzales became instant friends at first. He was kind of a confidant but the relationship develop into something romantic after some time who imagined that I would love to like being a relationship with my plastic surgeon like I would get so much work done for free. Anyway this time it was a little different with no rushing at all. They dated for a while. They're coming out as a quote-unquote formal couple which is like his words. They both had daughters from previous relationships and the families Blended pretty well, they even travel together. Why did I just think of that episode of the office when Michael photoshop's is picture magic arrows Christmas car why I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. I think the minute I read that even travel together - that scene came into my head. Okay. I'm sorry. Anyway, they're doing great. But but but a big but almost as big as mine and carols but not that big Javier had an ex-girlfriend who didn't take The Break-Up very well, and she was trying to raise hell on the relationship. She was verbally attacked lien public Steven. I made some serious threats that prompted Leah to end the relationship. She told her parents like a day before she died that she was a grown I'm grown woman with a kid. She needed to make good choices stay in a relationship wasn't worth the drama, which I totally agree like dude. I don't you love her like this is yeah so nice so good. I mean like it's a good relationship. This is working, but I'd I can't I don't have to deal with this and she does like umi's Thanks. Yeah, like he's strong, you know, it was really good. So now it's May 29th 2009. She tells her dad that she's going to meet with a classmate later on the day as far as we understood there were exchanging study material sump report or Preparatory stuff for the test. You know, some sources said like he had some quite the questions that are being to test some or the sources said some stuff like something else. Some people said they were like, Doing a project together irrelevant. They were like exchanging something. Okay, so he didn't she didn't really say with the friend was though so at 7 a.m. She got on a taxi and when her job Palacio de la giustizia. So now this might seem a little unusual for a lot of our listeners, but Lea was in constant communication with their parents, so they not only knew where she was at all times but had active Taxes are at all times. So keeping that in mind they get a little alarmed after she gets silent after she goes silent for two hours. But I mean, it's two hours. They just brush it off because she might just be busy. But yeah hours and hours passed and she still not picking up the phone. Hmm. But like 1:00 p.m. Her mom's already calling have years mom to check if she knew where Leah was and then she called have yet and all of us. She called them first free. Yeah, I know like yeah, that's what your Hound thing. That is such a thing. Yeah, so she All have yet and she wasn't with have year so he joined the word party they were all trying to call and she'll still in my ear at 2 p.m. Lea cell phone stopped ringing because it had been turned off. Oh, yeah, the parents didn't went to her workplace to investigate. They find out that she had left earlier with an unknown young men. Now Leah's mom was a former judge. So she might have used her Connections in her favor, but she was able to obtain. Security camera flew camera footage that showed Leah leaving with a man wearing a blue shirt and holding a folder. So they show the video song her classmates in one is able to identify the man. Was it water Jose de los acantilados Conte Contreras. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. So the video shows the entrance of the building and also access to the stairway like a door when the stairway is. Yeah, and we can see it wardo entering the building am then walking out a few minutes later. So the appears at 805 out of the staircase and walking out of the building wearing khaki pants and a pale pink shirt very big cash. That's business casual for you guys at on this animal passion. So it's still at the plaza toward you you just like sounded like Tom Haverford. I called chicken parms chicken parms pizza biscuits. Okay guys. So still the past you sorry. Yeah, so the parents are told the policy here and they talked to her colleagues and they tell them that the time that she left. She had been in a brief phone call and she will say okay over there by then hang up and she told her colleagues that she'll be right back. She even left her purse at the office. So she clearly didn't think she was leaving. Yeah, it was probably like to Intrigue. I'm very intrigued. Yeah, I wonder what's gonna happen to break up this sub downstairs. Why did I immediately think about food? That's just how I think Subs leave your purse. Yeah. Yeah, you tell me there's a sub downstairs. I'm leaving. My nephew's upstairs like you guys chill here. Like anyway, I did that today, but it was only for like two minutes. It's so I could get some hot dogs anyway. Oh, it's me. Sorry. So when the search party finds out about it, what don't they contact him? And he pops why the Palacio at around 3:00. He doesn't know where Leah is straight up dead end. He tells them that they left a philosopher earlier on his motorcycle. But before they reach their destination, she got a call and had to cancel the plans. They had made. Can you smell that? Mmm-hmm. She apologized and put a rain check on it, basically. Later on that day. He went back to the police tried 11 to pick her up again, but she wasn't there. That is true. By the way, he actually went there at 11 and she was already gone by mid-afternoon. The family is driving around since Italy. Hope looking for Leah. They're organizing prayer groups getting started on the missing persons Flyers all her friends and family are involved there thinking might be a kidnapping then they finally contact police. After all of this now, let's address that. Okay. She went missing at around eight or nine mid-afternoon. They're already prayer groups and missing were no police isn't this like the fastest? No, but it was actually very effective on this thing, you know because they're always on her and it was not like, you know, a suffocating like family situation know like it was always like it was just the way they were, you know, so the This is going to be like this why they were able to solve this case really fast because they're all on it. So it investigation starts right away, they talk to Eduardo and he says the same stuff. He had said before and Leah had a lot of people that were directly involved in her life, obviously, so that is a pretty long interrogation list. I comes and Leah still Missy that is absolute torture for her parents interrogation list. The investigators had was more like a suspect list really just a reminder. Leah had a sour ex-husband a recent ex-boyfriend. Adam was still looming around for some reason. She had a weird guy pick her up at her job and the crazy ex-girlfriend with the threats and shit. That's a field day for police and also Also on top of all of that. She had a soccer sorter. She had been getting these weird messages from an unknown number telling herself. Like, oh you look pretty today. I like your outfits Etc these P She gonna figure out who was sending her to text. So it's close to noon the day after Lee goes missing police working on the suspects. They're able to cross out the ex-girlfriend right away, but they're still working hard on a rest paying special attention to Javier. Actually, it was the main suspect that's when a woman walks into the station. She is losing stea Romero Eduardo's housekeeper. Oh shit, dude. Oh mmm. so let's put a pin on that for a second and talk about it was a bit shall we so it water was 24 from San Marcos. That's like two hours from since Alejo and he had been living with his sister Ximena and her husband. Akela is for five years at the La Palma neighborhood. I mean he's going to school it's insulated her like a bigger city, but like yikes, you know, so he was a classmate of the has and he was kind of known for being super smart. He was the kind of person who would like reading Tire books in a few days and had kind of brag about this. But anyways, he looks like an evil snail. That's the only way I can describe it. I've tried to do like that popsugar thing that you like put your picture and it tells you what kind of celebrity look like. And here the people that popped up it was ludicrous doesn't look nothing like Ludacris Robert Downey jr. And like Morgan Freeman. He's not black even so I don't know what's up with his face like that. Three reason of this be like because like even ludicrous and we're from a war like black licorice. Oh cool water them and you tell me I think I look like Ludacris more than he does. Jesus yeah, it looks like he works in IIT doesn't he look like a snail? Yeah, like I evil evil face. Yeah person. I don't know. Anyways, we're going to have a picture of him on Instagram. Huh? So loses stay logged tells the police that it was actually bought Leah home on the 29th at around 8:30. So right after she was picked up at the policy. Oh, so she was working and kind of lost track of the to while she made a rate through the house cleaning. She made her way to the master bedroom and it's vital kind of popped out of it like his head and he was like, hey, Loose can you buy some soda at the store real quick? And she was like sure I don't know. Who were you guys doing in there whatever so it's kind of weird and kind of condescending but like, you know, whatever and she comes back and it when the door is locked like the front door to the house is locked and he knocks he opens and he was like, all right, here's some more money go buy me some cookies. I hate this fucking guy just for that but Tim. This later. She makes it back to the house and she saw it why little tide sitting on his motorcycle with a blue Barrel between his legs? But didn't expect that. Right so it will take a 32 gallon container and it isn't like a metal drum. It's like a plastic-like track. It looks like a trash can like of a big trashcan plastic not metal. I know it's it's like a big bucket. Anyways, the bucket had a lid on it so she couldn't see if there's was anything inside. So Eduardo took the fuck off with a bucket basically on the bike like, you know, Trying to bounce Ellison. I'm just picturing out of that and it sounds like disasters this all actually happened. We don't make anything out of it like on a documentary. They have like a reenactment of it. It's possible but like, you know, I don't know. I feel like there's got to be a more effective way to dispose of Honor exact. So we're not getting ahead of ourselves anyways. So anyways loses teller she went back to work. Just clean the house. Whatever just a hiccup. She hadn't seen Dia lift that leave the house. So she just assumed that she was still inside the master bedroom bedroom. Of course, you probably thought they were just having sex in there or something. So that's why it was sent around and so she needs to clean the master suite so she knocks on the door three times, and there's no answer. She calls for deleting. Side, there's no answer and she opens the door and walks in and sees. A blood-soaked metres. So the sheets had been all removed and I was fresh Blood on the middle of the bed like right dead center the blood fresh, but what? Yeah, three hours later. It's hard to comes back with this bucket and starts cleaning. He washes the bucket his clothes his shoes the whole area everything at least it didn't make her washer weren't ya mean ya at around noon Ximena and achilles get home. They asked losses tell about what happened in their bed. Can you imagine walking your bedroom? And it's like blood. Yeah, right. So she tells them that she doesn't know. He has to do with it. Why didn't you ask me ask him, you know, so that's a good guess like not getting involved. But that's a good fuck off answer from a man. What do you think is mean like, why would you ask me? I just clean things. I don't like them dirty. It's like a little weird because house all day exactly. Yeah, so they don't call the police, but they're very worried which I'm sorry, but like if I found blood on my mattress out of nowhere, I'd be like I'm never sitting on that mattress ever again. And yeah the next day but a timely has picture was like everywhere. They showed a picture to lose. She recognized her as the lady who had been at the house almost immediately. I feel is takes her to the police station. Please go shooter house where they examined the mattress and find a blood. Obviously, but also clumps of hair. They find the bucket and notice that the bottom was broken something that would probably happen. If you put something really heavy inside the little bucket drumroll type of thing. They also find out what kind of egg rolls or something. What would you be exact or Rock several hammers exactly. They also find a blood-stained hammer. They start building up the case against Eduardo. And the main thing is to prove that Leah could fit into the bucket if I Woman that was about Leah sighs. She happened to be one of the investigators by the way. How fun. Because we're going mourners would set wouldn't set until all hours after the death. It is very possible to put someone in a bucket which I can just but picture the bones like cracking like, I don't know. I'm sorry. No, I mean she could fit like, you know, like with Annie search has just sitting in the bucket. Yeah, this is the kind of bucket that you like fill up with water and let you like kids play in it, which I've been inside that kind of bucket. So that's nice ruined a nice childhood memory for me this case. I feel like my grandpa's won't problem those things too. Yeah, it's like a big blue plastic. Yeah, like a water gallon the like you yeah. I know what you're talking about. I feel like yeah anyway, so they moved to find a body because they want to charge him with homicide instead of like kidnapping so they get a hunch that Lea might be at a nearby lake turns out that she wasn't The next the next day. Oh, sorry. Go ahead the next day. They move to First Eduardo. Anyways, that's funny because what's funny about that is that it will actually calls the police and tells them to come for him basically saying that he wants to be investigated because he's innocent. What a cocky asshole. Yeah that come for me. But yeah, so catch me outside. He tells them that the blood is really just because they had that sex on the bed. I don't know what kind of sex his Irene but not that I'm going to write that much blood or sex. Mmm. So he's also says that she left the house on her own after he was gone, basically. Contradicts his first statement that she left the motorcycle all that and that counts as evidence against him. So he was arrested only three days after Leah went missing on the 4th. He's already in front of a judge with the whole city out protesting to try to avoid the he gets away with murder. So this all happens fast and people get really involved which is cool. The whole Community is like pissed. I love it. The police actually had to escort him out of the courthouse with riot gear, you know, like those like big like Shields. Yeah. Yeah to avoid a lynching because people were pissed off rightfully. So by then he's playing the fifth. They don't have the fifth in a Million. Columbia but you know like he's it's not talking much doing it. Yeah. Yeah, and he's a he's like super cocky and still insisting that he didn't do anything. They in court show a picture of Leah to him trying to get like a guilt reaction or him and he just like Smiles just laughs. Yeah. So the police is using attention the case is getting to try and find out what happened. So they published the pictures of the involved and the bucket and an architect. I was working at a construction site recognized the bucket. He had seen Eduardo on the bike with a bucket. It's just like they don't forget, you know can imagine just like seeing him like yeah, cuz that's been passed down this fandom. Like that, like sounds we have you seen those pictures of like 20 people in one motorcycle. Yeah, that's exactly what I think. This must have looks like yeah, so he parked in front of him an empty lot of the Venetia neighborhood of since Alejo and he spent about 45 minutes. They're the guys like looking. He's like one of those like Grandma's the say it's like by the gate like walk out and fighting Street. Yeah. He's Definitely does not does not have like anything to do that day. Like I wonder when the guy with the book it's gonna leave so yeah, they go and search the lot and they find Leah buried in the shallow grave wrapped up in the bed sheets and in the fetal position with only a thin layer of dirt and waist covering her. Nice, we should have been joking before we said that so at Topsy confirmed that Leah died as a result of asphyxiation and that she had also been on the back with a hammer. She had been raped the guy had like broke her spine in several places with hammer. So that's where the blood came from the official narrative is that it wardo arranged the meeting with Leah to give her the papers. And she thought that he was going to show up with them. But instead he took her to her his house to get the paper. So there he tried to rape her. She struggled and he used such Force against her that he ended up strangling her and he didn't rape her after that because he killed her before he had the chance which fucking sucks. So he didn't put her inside the bucket which was used as a clean laundry basket usually at the house and he traveled on his motorcycle with the bucket for 15 minutes until he gone to the empty lot located not even 500 feet from her house from her home. You could actually see the empty lot from like her parents house. Oh my God, that's so sad. That's the most heartbreaking part of this case now. Cuz there cuz like they're looking for her and she's like literally right there. It's like soak the closest. So yeah. It was also determined that a doctor was the person who had been standing heard anonymous messages surprise surprise. He was calm.

See you later. Pull your obsessed with her. So during his trial like on the do you plead guilty part? He did a really nice speech. He said that this was all a joke. His family was Torn to Pieces. His dad had been threatened his mom was almost dying because having a son in jail is worse than death itself to a courtroom filled with Leah's friends and family. Can you imagine the size of the jackassery that you like He pled not guilty obviously, but he was sentenced to 29 years in jail for the murder The Disappearance and the highly of the body. He has never confessed. But he has said that he accepted the charges even though he still maintains his innocence. After an appeal, he was able to get three years and one of his charges out of the sentence today. He's in a maximum-security prison, but he's able to get out for we think 72 hours every year a benefit. That is a right for Colombian prisoners who served at least 3/4 of the sentence except that he really hasn't. Yeah, he was he was gift to that benefit like super early and no one else why Yeah, so it's not only Brazil to has the freaking fucked up sentencing system because of good behavior. He's eligible for parole in 2020, which is literally next year. Mmm. And if not, he'll be out by 2030 that's like 20 years after shield and probably exactly killed a mom in 2009. Remember 2009. Guys remember how like recent 2009 is? Think Jesse ever hitting a glass table think what else happened 2009 like oh my God, Katy Perry kissed a girl this 2009. That's like yesterday. I moved to America yesterday steps like because exactly 19. Anyway, it's like no, you know, yeah. Oh my God makes me so mad. There are a few question marks about the case including water Leah died at the empty lot or on the bed. And also what it was premeditated. Which if you ask me I think it was if he was like stalking her this whole time, but do you want to say what you think I mean? I think at least I hate the shape. At least a rape was premeditated because Lea didn't think that she was going to go anywhere with him clearly, but he did you know, and he took her home to get stuff but get this allegedly and I couldn't find too much corroborating like especially car sourcing and you know many sources saying this, so, please don't call me, but the empty lot was owned by Eduardo's brother-in-law the kiwis. So that plus the fact that it was located where it was located that close to the appearances house her house. Yeah that for me kind of seals it they was premeditated. Yes. Yeah, and also, I mean not I mean he was definitely trying to work an alibi like him like the whole thing of him actually going back to be as workplace at a round the Same time that you know like a few hours after before the parents went. You know you basically like finished dumping her body and when like right to the workplace to try to like a fucking piece of shit. Yeah trying to get his story, right? So yeah, the his brother-in-law he lives by the way. He's like the DEA. Like oh, yeah. Oh so that explains a little bit. I think I mean explains like why I think he got them, you know get out of jail card early. So Nia was killed on a DA's bed when you think about that kind of thing those terms. yeah, that's like and the outcome is like not even. Comparable to the gravity of the case. Yeah, not comparable. But like it's not enough. So the overall overall sentiment about this case not only with the local community, but also with Leah's family is that it / AC impugn basically being able to leave the prison this early in the sentence and I'll be in to be eligible for parole barely 10 years after the murder is just bananas her brother has vented on Social media about this and I think it's good to end this with something. Her dad has actually said so he said quote we lost our daughter. We haven't seen her in ten years a person like Eduardo should wrought on the soil which definitely doesn't translate well to English, but the sentiment definitely does he should just vanished Rock on the soil upon the land and work as a fertilizer. That's my final position. Honestly, I say this from the bottom of my heart judge me all you want listeners, but I seriously hope that whenever he gets out his ass gets Lynch. Dude, you guys are gonna watch the documentary right? Scroll down the comments. You'll see a bunch of people like a bunch of Mexicans like oh boy. How is this case happened in Mexico? The guy would be basically doesn't membered in prison first week, man, who would not have Which I think is hilarious thing to say, but like but you know, I know definitely hope that he dies. Yeah. So yeah, I mean, I'm sure those things happening come on in prison too. He's probably like when the high-profile, you know Taemin bear, but call me. Yeah. Yeah, I don't Colombian through my bed where they play Shakira all day. That's a point. Everybody's hips. Don't lie. You're sleeping sleeping in the middle of the night and all of a sudden check it out. Check it out you like, you know, that's your punishment. You can only reach out. I'm We had to wake up like dancing. Yeah, he is. Yes. Can you imagine that can you actually give day woke up people in prison would like frano mass dance routines that people had to do it like 5:00 in the morning. Oh my God. I'm like picture some people some picture, you know, I'm pushing like gar stress with last like the Village People. Wow, the cells. Let me run a point prison, but please I'm happy. Get some awesome ideas. Some people would enjoy it but like other people that's like the worst punishment for them. I feel like after like serving a ten year sentence that's definitely punishment. Like you enjoyed the first week, you know, but then when they start like doing the same songs all over again every day get on your feet get on and let it slide to the left slide to the right exactly. Oh my God. Oh my God. so you guys Oh, man. Are you still picturing? You know, do you do you watch American Dad? No. Fuck there's a there's an episode of American Dad. Where they dance so I'm gonna send you this episode later. But basically there's a dictator that forces people to dance to Bananarama. I'm like everybody has your day is like all day 24/7. So this is what I'm picturing it. I'm gonna send this to you. Definitely. I'm sorry. Sometimes my chair cracks. That's just not a good quality chair and you know, it's well made for my Brazilian body. I like my chair at work keeps like doing this and I'm like, yes, please break right here so I can get Workers Compensation. You're not broken my ass bone before right you have I have yeah, how did you do that? Oh my God. Okay Sobek story. I just got your episode here. But anyways, I was like 11 man. I was like going to field trip to the caves. We're going like to the caves, you know, and so we're going to the caves and that was like one of them. I think it was. Oh my God, what was the name? The name of the case was agua. Suja. Dirty water doesn't even if the cave so there ya are as we want to cover the Java which is the the devil's cave because there's like a face. Face that looks like the devil like on the on the one of the walls but that's like a light cave because you have like rails and stuff you have like path. But dirty water was like Caves at the whole thing. You have like water up to your 11-year old ways. But anyways on the way back, we're like super wet, you know, and I'm going to go through like this hike, you know, and it was like wet stone and it was like, oh my God. No, it was like a I was like super concentrated on like not Alan right and they will take this piece that it was like a totally go down like some like the move like a stair like staircase like, you know, like and I was like so Mario she loves him Donkey Kong like stairs and I felt like I got out of the stairs and like I was like, yeah, I did and I fell on my ass like sitting out back just slam down. I broke my ass, but I didn't find out until after the 10 hour bus ride back home. So my ass was very in your broken ass for 10 hours. I sat on my broken ass for 10 hours and my ass was injured and then we went to a doctor like But wasn't even a bone doctor orthopedist. This is a person that actually exists. His name was Kimball the name of the Kimball but King ball with a W Kimball Kimbo. Yeah. Dr. Kim Bo so, dr. Kimble ordered me to sit on a thing that looks like a float like a donut Lifesaver. Yeah. So for me a very bullied eleven-year-old showing up this school with a little float thing was not nice on my making friends thing. So yeah, I had to leave the school the Eddie another your because I was not having you the time but that's a story for later. Yeah, but at least your parents were supportive and like took me to the doctor. Yeah change you, you know change schools. Oh no total because a lot of toads. Yeah because like like at least not my parents but like my grandma Whole raised my sister for a few years like my sister tells me that if she got beat up at school and she came home. She was like, oh Grandma's on beat me up. My grandma beat her up and be like, this is what you get for coming home crying instead of being who ever beat you up, you know? Yeah, so Your parents could have been like yeah toughen up. Yeah, so I mean they wanted me to be the one to change me like change classes, you know, would you can do them Brazil? Because if you guys don't know it's like the same class and then the teachers rotate instead of yeah, the class is rotating here like it is in America. So she wanted to change me to a different class and she was like, oh you can make friends there. Well, then my aunt was like fuck you guys don't do that change schools, and then we'll school when I went to That I actually liked and I had a chain that's a different story for later time metal leave that school for a different reason but it was yeah, I stayed in that Ike which problem might be you Carol. I mean you probably was honestly, but the next school was super cool because it wasn't my communist school where I went to a mess there. I went to a misstep protests. I went to like a colomba on that school. It was a lot of learning and I loved it. It was great. Like, excuse me. Easy ninth grade trip to a since I mean sink there, huh? We love it. It was good. I didn't know where I was going. But then and the q1 was really good because I'm a was a lot of fun. You know, I would think that that would be him but not like it missed a I'd be like what am I doing here? Why don't you guys have houses that would really like know they know it was like what they do after they invade the lands. It was like a farm just the farm. Oh, yeah. Okay. Okay. Okay. It's like Negative I'd like because this what they do is they they get into like a big like usable like land for agriculture. That's not being used in any way and they invade it and after they are able to acquire that land through legal processes and we have that legislation that allows for that and result and then they divide the land into like little pieces in each little piece goes to a different family and they can like Farm on it and stuff. I think it's pretty Cool still it's not very used, you know. Yeah, but that's a very controversial thing Brazil. But that specific place that I went to the land had been acquired by a farmer like a big farmer fraudulently. So it was not his first place. So up for grabs are rather free go to the poor people just like this one is nice nice people. Yeah, I like the Robin Hood type of thing would like which people's lands. Yeah. So yeah guys, I think this is a good place to end it with Communism. If anyone's listening to this, I did not show any support you anything. No. No, it's just me talking guess. Yeah, we'll talk about more about fraudulent land acquiring and farms on our episode is coming out later this week breaking the format times 2. Yes. Mmm, what's gonna talk about the whole how do we say in the world situation that's happening right now. schedule a shitstorm on fire Exactly. Mmm. This girl is on fire. Did you see the video that deep fake video? They did they got Alicia Keys in the yeah, so it's not as face on her so much. Anyway, I'll kill you first have a good Facebook group that we can like post that kind of stuff. It's like see all the means that we write. Will we ever have a Facebook group dog? Well, maybe when Facebook people get a little better. Yeah, I don't know. Yeah, I'm afraid that if we have been dumpster fires. Yeah, every that if we do create a Facebook group, you just like implode in two months. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, so maybe someday if you guys asked for it we'll do it, but that will be a tough screening process. Number one question. Have you ever started a dumpster fire on purpose? If so, leave the link so I can read up on it. Yeah. So yeah you guys I hope you guys continue to have a good end of the world because he has already started by Estelle. Ciao.

Now you guys enjoy my podcast for the day have a good one. What's going on told my beautiful listeners on my podcast. I would like to make this episode dedicated to the ego because I just think a lot of people don't understand the eagle and what is all about? Okay, I think some people kind of get it but at the same time You know, I guess because so many people's brain are using the left hemisphere is kind of like it can kind of like fog the broader perspective of of what the ego is all about. Now this three reality this this Matrix, you know right now every what we are experiencing right now. Okay, from what we came out of our mother's womb. Umm to when we leave the physical. This is all ego base. Okay. So this entire room is revolving around ego. All right, we are in the 3D Matrix. We are in the third dimensional density. All right or fear. Okay. We are experiencing this 3D realm in the 3D sphere. All right. so, you know when people in the spiritual Community or real individuals that are doing the spiritual work, you know, they're going to constantly talk about the ego because this is something we really have to become aware of on the 3D Matrix because if we don't become aware of our ego is going to consume us and we're going to start operating from it on a very very very very very extreme rate and that is To call the false self. Okay, so when people operate from their ego on an extreme rate and their detached from who they truly are their authentic being, you know, they're not going to even recognize that they're operating from a false self. And this is why a lot of people have issues with projecting self-reflecting introspecting taking accountability things in that nature because they're operating from their false self and an Same rate. They're very very very very detached from the true self. That is you know, the buried within your being. Okay, the body system is just the mobile. You are not the body you are the soul. The body is just something you're using until you leave when you leave your physical flesh. You're not taking your body with you. Okay, and this is the whole thing where reincarnation if people are not aware of themselves and people are just Doing a lot of toxic shit to each other and and it's sad because there I don't think some people are even capable of acknowledging their own toxic traits because they're operating from the false self. So extremely that they think is normal they think is okay and they just start justifying those things. Like they don't know how to self-reflect. They don't know how to acknowledge like wow. I've been doing this all my life, but I didn't realize how toxic it was to me or others. Some people don't know how to do that and it's a sad reality. But now the twist to this is that people think they know how to take accountability. They think they know who they truly are and they think they know like how to tune in keyword think and that's because many people are trapped in the mind. You know what I'm saying? They they But everything that they are experiencing in the 3D realm there, they're stuck in the mind and they're not really truly embodying the things that they're thinking or saying out of their mouths. You understand what I'm saying? They're not embodying it and this is why so many people don't you know, they don't know how to back up their words what action it's a sad reality. All right, A lot of people are stuck in their head. Ed and detach from the body, you know, they you know, they forgot to to I guess it's not that they've they have blockages from embodying the things that are coming out of their mouth. All right now like I mentioned the Eagles not gonna die if you want to kill the eagle, you have to kill yourself. There's no other way around it. Okay, but when spiritual people say, oh kill the ego they're just talking about become aware of the fucking shit. That's really what they're trying to say. Okay. You know, if you kill the ego your you have to kill yourself because then that means you have to leave your body every matter on this physical is ego-based every materialistic thing. All right, even when we speak every time we express ourselves every time we think okay, all of that is Eagle base. You understand what I'm saying? Even when you take action all of that is ego-based, but of course You know, some people have unwell a lot of people actually not some they have unhealthy Eagles. Okay, where's to extreme and they're stuck on their head and you know what I'm saying? They're in prison to their head and their detached from embodying whatever the hell they thinking or whatever the hell they're saying and these are people that are operating from their false self, you know, and it's a sad reality, you know, you know, you can when you speak to people you can see the Ego versus the true self, you know, you can see the difference. You see what I'm saying? But at the same time when you have unhealthy ego you realize like okay, you know, it's still a part of me. So I'm going to have to utilize this in a proper manner. Where is not consuming me too much where I'm operating from a false self a false identity, you know, you know how many people are operating from a delusional? No mindset, it's a lot and and you know, this is the 3D Matrix, you know, everything that is created here on this physical came from a thought. You see what I'm saying? So everything came out of nothing so all of the stuff that that we give matter to his only important because we created that reality and are self-conscious but there's no importance and the majority of the shit on the 3D Matrix not even your body. It's a reality, okay. There is important from the ego the all these things are important from the eagle. So when you have a healthy ego you learn how to you know, do things that is good for your physical body. Go to the gym. He healthy, you know, all those things work out, you know, go ahead and on the physical, you know, do what you need to do. Make your personal life better for your for yourself because we're all individuals. We are we all here for a different purpose. So what I'm here and the vision I have on this physical is different from one of the person because we all lived through different mental Dimension. And I think people forget that, you know, people are very one-track minded but you know, you just cannot escape the ego but at the same time you have to utilize it properly like I mentioned, you know what I'm saying? You have to know because the ego is basically, you know, what you're going to what you're going to utilize the most on the 3D Matrix. Okay, because this is the realm of the ego but not the problem is a lot of people are too detached from their true self their true nature and they're operating from it on an extreme rate. And this is the cause of blockages. Okay, people also tend to be very very You know, they told you one thing but then their action tells you another and that's because the false self is doing that you understand what I'm saying? But you cannot blame these people, you know, it's just the way the body system is like a machine and it's just the way these people are operating on the physical and how self-aware they are of their body which is like a computer system. How aware they are of it. Okay, you are the only one that could uh, you know, decode and recode and and reprogram yourself. Subconscious nobody else can do that. But now if you live heavily from the false self then and you have no control of your power you understand what I'm saying the false self, which is the ego seeks external validation constantly seek external materialistic things, you know, like, oh, well, you know and this is the cause of rebounding I'll give you an example like, you know, let's say you're dumping your partner because their shitty person and then they don't want to take accountability or self reflect that there actually Teddy person because they're operating from the ego the false self, you know, so they don't know how to Humble themselves to go within you know, and and do they know work right as above so below so below so above so what happens to these people is they because they're so delusional to their own shit right there living from the ego and an extreme rate, they run and and and try to find anybody that's going to give them any kind of attention just to seek the validation just to seek the justification that they're not toxic that there are not the problem. You know what I'm saying? This is why a lot of people rebound because you know is usually toxic people that do a lot of rebounding so, you know, what happens to these type of entities is they don't they don't want to take accountability. They don't want to be like, wow. I'm really I'm a shitty person. You know, I just really do need to work on myself. They don't know how they don't want to do that. They're too weak. So instead. They're gonna go ahead jump into a new relationship and then they're going to Feed their ego more through external validation and say well look this. I have a new partner and this person that called me toxic is still single, but I have a new partner and I'm in a new relationship. So obviously that person is the problem not me because look I'm in a relationship and is way better than that relationship. I was in and thought of and you know, that's what the ego does because they egos a trickster. It talks a lot in the mind. It uses words all those words in your brain. That's not you you just a listener. You just observe her. Okay, and you know many people have different name for this, you know, and people, you know, religious people like to call it the that the devil demons, but it's not really the devil or demons. It's just people avoiding the Shadow Self. Okay, the more people avoid the Shadow Self And the more they gonna keep living through external validation. And then this is these this is why individuals think that the devil's and external thing, you know. Oh, you know, why is this happening to me? Why is why is the devil attacking me, you know, these are individuals that live from the ego and an extreme rate you feel me? There's they're afraid of the dark. They're afraid of themselves. The dark is the true self, by the way, you know, and not every darkness is bad, you know. No, you just have to learn how to balance the light and the dark because when you too extreme on the light, you can operate from the false self ego base. When you too extreme in the dark, you're going to consume that energy so much that you can become very self-destructive and very negative on the physical. Okay and very evil doing things doing evil things to people without you even realizing it. Okay, but if you're too extreme on either end, it can become evil. Have to learn how to balance the yin and yang within the body system is state center. Okay, but you know, I just want to make this clear that you cannot kill the fuckin Eagle. Okay, it's just about becoming aware of it. Okay and and things in that nature, you know and about 95% of the time if we go up to people and we just give them are unwanted opinion of who they are, right? You know a lot of people love doing this to other people, but what people that do this are constantly projecting and is sad because they don't realize it, you know, people that constantly have to give their unwanted opinion to other people without the other individual asking for in stuff like that. Usually that's that's most likely a projection. Okay, you know when somebody is at when somebody's ready to ask for your advice, they're going to ask you okay, but the you know a lot of us we just give our unwanted Penny in and perceive it as an advice because the ego wants to justify what they're about to say and they're not realizing that they're projecting. They're not realizing that what they're saying to that individual is actually something that's relying in their own conscience and they're not aware of it because they don't know how to self-reflect and introspect, you know, if you ask me I think one of the biggest and the biggest key to existing here on this physical Without becoming too extreme on either end. It's just fucking self reflecting and introspecting people just do not know how to do that. You know, people are just constantly distracting themselves running away from themselves. And you know, they're just living the fast life and you know what I'm saying, and and all of that stuff is like a it's like a drug to the ego, you know, because the ego definitely releases some type of Endorphins in the brain when it is fed. Okay. So if it become a if it becomes a monster, you know individuals are going to do what they need to do to feed it. And unfortunately, you know, this is what happens to narcissist individuals there. There are slaves to their ego. Unfortunately, you know, they're stuck there. You know what I'm saying? It's you know, this is the Matrix the body system is a computer and you know, some computers are fucked up. You feel me? Some computers have some deep viruses that I don't even think is possible for it to come out you feel me? But you know, I just wanted to make this clear because you feel me a lot of people think like, oh, you know, you know, you know, they go around talking about all you got ego you got ego Everybody does even you telling that individual you got ego. That's your ego doing that. You know, everybody does the Eagles always going to exist and is heightened here because this is the this is the home of it. So it's very big here, but it's about Making it healthier don't beat into it too much to the point. It becomes a monster. Okay, and then you can't control it in your in your in your being you understand what I'm saying? But who you truly are is very transparent. All right, you are a transparent Source. The soul has no gender. It has no no physical attachment anything but we are experiencing this. Room right now. So your soul is trapped within your body. Okay, and eventually as time progressed and and and we and we leave this physical then you your your soul is going to free yourself out of the body. Okay, but at the same time they call this the Saturn moon Matrix, so they using Carmen us a lot here a lot of car Manos. Okay. So if you going a lot of things that are perceived as normal, you know from The Matrix is actually not normal and you know It can cause more karmic depth in your being but that's what the elites want because they want you to come back. They want you to come back right over here so you can keep being a slave to them. So that's why they're going to you know, set the system up to the point where you're going to come back regardless, you know. You know, but I think there's a possibility that people can actually transcend out of the 3D. Once they leave and not come back, you know, definitely you definitely have to have a good heart. You definitely cannot be using people and taking advantage of people and distracting yourself and feeding your ego, you know, and and thinking you're better than people and cheating on people and sneak being sneaky and this Leaving people and a lot of things there's a lot of things that people are doing and the sad reality is they're not even they can't even be there not even able to acknowledge these things. They're not even able to say wow. I didn't realize this toxic trait was in me because the eagle is Big here. People don't know how to take accountability. Okay, so I felt like ranting about them, you know, because I just feel like people confuse the whole ego thing big time. Big time. So yeah, that was it. You guys have a good one.","– ""If you kill the ego, you have to kill yourself."" That's what self-help author and podcaster Tracy Anderson recently said on her podcast, and it's a quote that's getting quite a bit of attention. It comes from an interview she gave to the BBC in which she explains that most of us have an ego that keeps us from being who we really are. ""If we don't become aware of our ego is going to consume us and we're going to start operating from it on a very very very very very extreme rate,"" she says. ""So when people operate from their ego on an extreme rate and their detached from who they truly are their authentic being, they're not going to even recognize that they're operating from a false self."" She goes on to explain that most of us don't know how to ""self-reflect"" because we're stuck in our head and don't know how to ""embrace the things that are coming out of their mouth."" So what to do? "" detach from the body,"" she says. ""You are not the body you are the soul. The body is just something you're using until you leave when you leave your physical flesh.

It's beenIt's been really good, you know DJ to wedding last night as I do I was at sorry for hustling. Do you have a side Hustle No, you know, which is quite interesting because I always had a side hustle and in college and came out here and it just like I wanted to find a side Hustle, but then it's like It's like you have to turn in a resume just to get a freakin coffee shop job or your bartender and it just like it's to you have training days. I just like our lawyer above that. Are you above that turning in a resume for? No, it's just that like I just got like, you know, when I was younger I didn't have to turn a resume. They just told me to fill out an application and come in and do an interview and you're good to go for like, you know, it's got to structure for my liking and just like that's life in the valley dude. You gotta have a master's to work in a coffee shop. Now in the valley, that's what it seems like so I just kind of like put that on the side just kind of like enjoy my weekends now, but I want to find a sidekick Oh, I thought it's pretty funny. When I saw that you were DJ and I was like, what is this dude doing is you get like invited to every wedding what's going on here? Oh, yeah, it's dude. I couldn't believe that you texted me asking if I get paid for that or if I just go for fun. I don't know. Yeah. Yeah, I get paid great company gonna gonna do a little shame. This plug actually we don't have any sponsors. They're not paying me for saying this is obviously but Sound by Design great company if you want us to DJ your weddings, we do an incredible job, especially in the greater Milwaukee area. We've got a pretty great reputation same owner as Camp bar. And you know, how well can't bars are run throughout the city. So Sound by Design look us up on Google Facebook Instagram Twitter the likes go ahead and Give us a shout out if you're getting married and need a DJ. Did you have to do training until I get like taught how to DJ or Yeah, there was a training there was some training involved. But basically you start off as an assistant. You just kind of helped bring everything in and then after a little bit. Once you know enough they'll let you become like a lead DJ. Nice. Nice. Yeah, dude. So earlier this week when I texted you, right, you know last week we talked about how adulthood is all like Like, you know this and that and what not just like it's not out. That's not what it is. You know, you expect it to be or what you said you wanted to be if I may say, I don't know where I'm going with this but earlier this week one of my co-workers, he's Russian and he's been in the US and he's like did Hollywood really screwed me over because you know, he will have to stay in the way they were. So many people put of All Peoples around. Yes. He got stuck in a hole, you know in your adulthood partying and doing crazy stuff and you're gonna have like friends and all that all that good stuff that Hollywood portrays of like a great life and then he's like man Hollywood really screwed my life and he's like 31 and he's like one of the smartest engineers and our floor and I just thought how like funny is that he said that because like yeah like some Some aspect of like Hollywood is like pretty fun to watch and like, you know makes you you know, wish you had a life like that but I never thought someone would take it that literal, you know like to some extent like I took friends like the TV show a little bit like serious. They're like, yeah, I got my I think that's fair. Yeah. I thought my 20s our early 20s would be like that but obviously it's not like that, you know, just like where are you where there's three guys and three girls that are just are somehow best friends and all hook up with each other. And yeah, there's they reserve it in the matter of 27 minutes. Yeah, we've resolved it. I said reserve it. Oh my God. All right, and I just thought it was like just kind of fun. Because like the bra a little bit nostalgic to me when I when I when he said that to me because I'm just like there are a lot of things when I was like young and I was just thinking about like once I get to College. I'm going to live this lifestyle once again, you know a job of a live this lifestyle and it's like damn that was not how I portrayed this like whole story to be like not saying that like, my life sucks right now whatnot. But like to some extent there are a lot of things. I watched on TV that I thought would come to fruition like what Got to that point and then here a 31 year old talk about how Hollywood scooters life just kind of like well, what are some things that I miss from back then or whatnot, you know? Yeah. Absolutely. Do you have any examples of those things that you can think of off the top of your head? Yeah. I mean it's ships is it you know, what you would be spending your free time doing. What is that? What are you kind of going on there? So, you know, I was thinking like this is like on Friday. I was with the girls and friends and I just didn't go out and then I always think about how like in grade school and high school. The one thing that you look forward to every dance party was like a good torque dance. Yeah, I know. I know what it was, but I just like no one goes to party and just says you're saying you were looking back like you were watching like and young adult films that came out weird not young adult films films and TV shows that portrayed Yadkinville, but what I'm saying is you had seen them. Partying and every single party there was just Molly being tossed around and you know you like somebody was getting too worked on dead at some point and you just assume man. That's College. That's what it's actually like Asher Roth was no it before then like like high school like dance just like prom whatnot. I went to Catholic school and it was so funny because I remember R1 dance where they like band torque and right. So this is where this is where like you knew you had to decide this is where you knew you had boys. It was like one of our Dean's will look like ogre right would always be looking in to like the dance floor and making sure everybody's being a poet. He look like Shrek Shrek he did he would look into like the look into like that for make sure everybody was good and then like everyone would be in a circle just like with their hands out. Covering just that one person who's gonna twerk dance and then they'll let that happen to the next song someone else and you put your hands up and I just thought that was so funny to me that we actually did some stupid stuff like that. You went to the you went to the wildest. I'm school that I've ever heard. It's a goblet. What is insane Catholic school? And then that does like to behavior and I was like like, you know, just like dancing with someone casually, like now it's like awkward even go up to someone and be like, hey, what's up? How are you doing or like even try to block you want to dance but they're back then it was like, you know, you guys are dancing while just having a great time, you know, and now it's like yeah, I know I know. Oh that person's that person standing on the Dance Floor. How how we are they? I don't know man. Like I don't know why but like that. I just thought about it. I was like, that's the one thing I just could recall that was like part of probably like the funniest and like Some some somewhat like a thrill to know that you're going to experience that going to a dance party. Hey, you know, what's also another weird thing is this like me and my friends we would go to these teen parties, right? And my mom was never before so go to these teen parties the same atmosphere yet. I mean same atmosphere, but no, what do you mean teen parties? Like they're like people and like like What was like between highs games like high school parties, but not like your friends hosted in my the house, but like actual like promoters that created like a party. I was only four teenagers like oh, yes, we had this thing called night storm. It was the same thing called Purple Haze as Dallas. Yeah, you look who's at some random. Yeah. Yeah. They try to make it. Try to try to like create to get young adult there. Yeah, it's pretty much like until you were 19. I can't tell you how many of those I went to her. Like I would go to that with my friends and my mom I'd like to my mom and be like, hey, I'm like doing some sort of like sporting event with my buddies and I'm staying at their house this night and then it would be a Saturday night will go to the stuff. Right and I go and it would get back on. Our friends parents will bring us back home like around like 2 or 3 a.m. But then I'd wake up at like six o'clock to make sure I got home so I can go to church with my mom so that she doesn't get mad with That's like every Saturday I would do this and it's like oh my God, this is like just kind of like I got little bit. I don't know I got I thought that was pretty free cool times or whatnot and then last night I watch The Cosby Show which even brought more more nostalgic people like that's an use. Yeah, but that also like Kozlov like a social ban on that show man. I think you're supposed to stop watching it all anymore. I just like I remember watching for when I was younger and it was just there and I was like, I don't remember this. Obviously, there's like some controversial things going on right now with you know, Bill Cosby or whatnot, but also like what's not There are some controversial things that are going on. I think we can yeah, we know what those controversial things are many it's already out there. But oh, I'm just trying to say that was like watching it to praise him. But I was just watching it to be like I used to watch the show. Yeah, it was on it because it was on watch the show for the folks that that haven't caught on. Our topic of this week is nostalgia. That's kind of what we wanted to talk about. But I'll stop interrupting, you know, any go ahead and continue now. I understand why you were watching it. I was sure of his actions at all. It was just a it was just you know, I was just like, you know, watch it like man. I used to watch that everybody Jake what some things you miss from childhood? So I was thinking about this for a while. I kind of had me had me thinking I had to take some time out today. but one of the big things for me when I started Boy Scouts There were a lot of camping trips that we went on. So this was this was Middle School. This is 6th grade middle school. And I joined this this troop and it wasn't. The most in line with like the boy scout values, I guess it was pretty much just a bunch of people who wanted to go camping on the weekends and do cool shit, but we had to kick it. Scout like related so each month, there will be a new camping trip. And it would be revolved around a merit badge. So for instance, there was a biking merit badge you had to do 50 miles a 50 mile bike ride. So our dads just said well, why don't we just like 50 miles out. We all meet at a point two dads can drive their trucks to meet us at the Meetup point at a campsite 50 miles away. We find a bike trail that will take us 50 miles to that destination and then we just can't there that night. There's a rock climbing merit badge. So we went to Devil's Lake which is a has a ton of limestone and whatnot. So we learned how to rock climb on these legitimate Limestone rock formations basically as opposed to just going to an indoor facility. There was a lot of that stuff white water rafting we did there was a canoeing trip. There's like a canoeing merit badge. We're supposed to just do a certain mileage of canoeing I believe and so we got dropped off upriver canoe down like five miles or something to an island down this River stayed on the island for the night had a massive fire made our food and whatnot and then canoed another. Three miles the next day where we were picked up. It was pretty incredible. And I just remember that being such a cool experience because I've never really gone like roughing it camping. There's always a structure that we stayed in and we were all just kind of like thrown into these situations. Whereas like no like set up your tent make your own food like your own fire. And I mean as an eleven-year-old that's that was kind of an interesting experience. But I just remember being on those trips and like sleeping under the under the stars just an incredible time and it just presented some Solace and you know in an in our life, I think, you know, we can we can kind of get back to what people are doing in our age and I mean, there's a lot of partying and whatnot. and at that age, I think we were definitely idolizing the whole party scene as well, but you can I guess Relate everything to some sort of escapism, you know people party just to let go just to release have a good time kind of forget whatever is going on and just spend time with their friends and and you know, just hit let inhibitions lower I guess. But as I was writing this down and thinking about that, I definitely had that same feeling, you know, when you just go camping, you know, you you get done with a 50-mile bike ride. That's like not even paved roads or anything like a paved route you get done with that and you can't at the end of it. There's this experience that you hold with the people that have that have Also done it and you just have this sense of accomplishment like a sense of bliss sleeping under the stars with a fire is always just a comfortable experience and you just you just sleep. Well, you know, and it's definitely an escapism. It's like, all right. Well, I have class in obviously class in middle school was horrible, but you can just remember. Okay well Next weekend. I'm going on this camping trip, and we're going to go whitewater rafting and I'm pretty pumped to just do something that's completely outside of So that was a big memory of me and looking at some pictures when I was doing that. I've sold some old camping trip memories. Yeah, it's a good time. It's like thinking about it. It's like it's really like I just I got a lot of trouble. But it was like I was always up to something, you know, and I know it's like I had a lot of fun when I was younger. They say scheming. Yeah. Yeah, man, I was always up to something and like my mom can trust me to go camping and like do something. So like always played Sports to keep me busy. So I didn't like doing thing like as I start playing more Sports. I kept I started doing less stupid things. But before I was playing sports, I was like always up to something bad like like everything was just But yeah, I mean that's the one thing I actually didn't really do a lot when I was young Grouse go camping. But then again that could be a stereotype thing in the woods Bears. Yeah. I don't know if I would have wanted to do that little butt. How's that a stereotype thing Hollywood movie of some black person in the Middle Woods ends up being a black person dying first. So there's like this fear of being a middle of the Woods. Okay, what did what did we learn about Hollywood in the beginning of this podcast? Yeah, there's that but like yeah, I don't know you're still a fear going into the woods. I think it's every horror movie which is which is quite unfortunate. But you know, thank God for movies like get out. Just Paving the way for four solid horror flicks big fan of that. What's really good like? Movie that's like not your typical Hollywood movie where like it? It's like lies about how life should be or how like this. The most truthful truthful movie you've ever watched would you think of this? hmm I mean, I'd like one of my one of my favorite movies is about time. That's one of my favorite movies. I'd say it is my favorite movie and there are definitely some Hollywood Parts. They're just like, all right, man. That was a that was a Hollywood thing, but it's definitely a pretty good feel good movie on an aspect of your life that you don't really think about until Kind of one scene towards the end first time watching this movie is is incredible. I highly highly recommend it. It doesn't have that great of reviews everybody that I've watched it with and I've talked to about it. They love it. They love the movie and it really just gives you an aspect of this life that you live and haven't really thought about but once the film brings light to it you kind of realize Wow. All right. Yeah that makes sense. It's not like any particular life lesson it more just helps you realize. Something that you probably take for granted in your life. I'd say yeah, I have actually never watched that movie before but like well, you should do that because I think it's on Netflix now finally. Okay. Yes. You should definitely want that shambles right now actually on Netflix right now as we speak, but apparently like I was watching before I called you. I'm not going to say the name of it because I get judged by it. But come on man. Hey Tony, what I was gonna say. Is that like are you not you should tell me what that is. Actually, I'm not get charged. I can't get a good job, but it's called someone great. It's on Netflix. But what I bought I was trying to say is like from When my co-workers like his situation, I'm curious like how people's life force actually or how many people think that their life like is messed up because of what they watch and believe them. What do you told me that I just couldn't stop laughing and he got offended but he was actually being so serious. I just didn't think that people really took it to that extent of like actually believe in their life's going to be like this and I think some people actually like live a life, but that's because you're using your parents money, but the average person like cannot live a Hollywood, you know inspired lifestyle. This is so it's got to be really sad if people are actually aspire to live like that right now or hoping that that's where they have most gonna come from. They really kind of makes me think because you know a lot of shows are. they just always have a happy ending, you know, we always expect a happy ending just like all right, this is gonna this is gonna work out seamless, so I don't need to worry about seamless and I really think people people have Somewhat believe that where it's like, okay, I don't have to I don't have to deal with this right now. Like it's gonna work out or something's going to happen. And I think people really have a hard time. Including myself, like definitely myself grasping the idea that okay. Yeah, this is going to work out but it's only going to work out if I put forth effort to make it work. It's not just going to be you know, do what's comfortable and just assume it's going to work itself out some of these issues. It's it's definitely more. So the realization that you know you have in your life. These these skills and these capabilities to kind of just grab Yourself by the haunches and in and change these aspects but I think people really just kind of forget about so let's let's get back into friends, right? Let's get back into friends. Yeah, Rachel Rachel and Ross broke up. Yeah. Okay. Thank you. but there took a point where they had to talk about it like they I really am having a hard time completely remembering but I think Rachel was just not I totally uninterested in hearing about what happened. But if you also remember Ross was kind of grasping with the grappling with the idea of do I tell her and right away it was like, yeah, I tell her I really don't think people actually make those decisions right away. They they do make the decisions for instant Comfort where it's like I'm not To tell her or you try to defend yourself and in certain ways, but then even when that does happen, I think what Hollywood really? Downplays is the fact that it is a super super stressful time and it doesn't go away after 30 minutes of an episode like most people assume like okay. This is going to be resolved at the end of the episode. I just have to get through that and it's fine, but I don't think people realize is how long that takes like it takes it takes time and it takes Continuous like focus on whatever you're doing. So if you get into an argument like that, I think it real life it would last. Days if not weeks. You know some type of argument we've had four for the other person to actually be like, okay, this is this is how I feel about it and to completely gathered all their thoughts. But until then it's pretty messy. It's not just messy for five minutes and then they resolve it and then it's good. So I think that's probably where The biggest thing that I guess I've found there's a new show on Netflix that's called friends from college. It's like our generation of friends and it is pretty much a bunch of friends who went to the same College together and they just pretty much like screwing each other just like the other friends but this one's like even more raunchy like like they're really like our generation type of friends and how they would how would we how we would interact with friends and it's quite scary because then it's like it goes to another topic of like what is like marriage going to look like within our generation which doesn't seem like a lot of people are for the whole title. I want to be married and whatnot. But like I mean, there's some great tax benefits, but also like some people like, you know, aren't really whole like I'm really for the whole monogamy lifestyle, especially with like going after going to college and no one that you can like literally be with the whole world and whatnot and just like move on here and there and there and I'm not speaking for myself new scene in general like our generation generally more what you're saying is just like serial monogamy. Yeah, but you mean you have like one person for six to six months to however many years and then you kind of grow apart a little bit. Yeah. Yeah as opposed to just like baby baby, baby. Yeah. I don't know. I mean that that shows. Pretty good. I mean I just finished watching it a nice texture one of my friends. I was like, this is totally your lifestyle right there. Like this is you and that girl and he has some cheat on each other and deal with this and that and he's like probably has like a can't we just laughed at it? But but yeah Hollywood Hollywood and him if you listen to his podcast stop daydreaming about what your life. could be and just probably daydream about what your life was like before and just get that installed sick feeling and be happy for that. Jake what do you got? I think so too. I kind of just want to add on that when I was thinking about this, you know, we always you know, you hear motivational speakers talk about don't dwell on the past something like that or people generally think about the past is negative. They they can only remember negative things because I mean- things strike more emotion. So this is this is hard to find. You know, what what specific moments in my life made me genuinely happy. It was like well, I remember that moment. But that was not a good one. That was a negative. Yeah, and just so on and I think probably you know, it's very easy to go and think of the past, you know, you just sit in bed at night and it's like oh, yeah. I remember that thing that I did when I was in third grade. That was just really dumb. Yeah. What was I thinking it is just as well on that for the next like 10 minutes. Yeah. I think it's really easy to get into that. So I mean maybe maybe the next time you think of something that's negative that you did in the past try and think of something really really positive that you remember in that in as close of a time period to then and maybe maybe you won't look so negatively on the past. I don't know. I'm gonna try that out. Yeah. Not take Hollywood movies are shows to Sears. Even though it does make me like laughing like happy in the moment of like what could be but like yeah dick excited for Game of Thrones last episode today. Yeah, I'm very excited very very excited for the show to be done and then I can stop being so disappointed. So I feel ya are you not happy with last week? So it was I mean it was probably it was one of the better episodes because I really didn't see. I'm not I don't want to be a spoiler show. So I didn't really see that big thing that everybody who has seen the show knows what I'm talking about where someone does is they weren't supposed to and other things happen. Basically, basically though we did not see that this I didn't think it was gonna be that probably sounds so weird to people who don't know what I'm talking about. But other than that man the writing assistant asked it's been absolutely all right podcast. We're going over time a little bit. Thanks for tuning in tune in next week.

Thank you in advance. I look forward to keeping you all to in during our first episode. We talked about taking a chance of getting out of our own way. Just doing that thing that we've been thinking about considering dreaming of our lease initiating the process. says to getting to that place and almost everyone is familiar or has reported to me that they could totally relate to it and just overall that's the kind of impact that I hope to have while talking aloud and sharing, you know. My Views and perspectives not to sound too Shay, you know on things that somewhere somehow and you know, I'll process we've Cross these these issues are there they've come across and sometimes they're easy to deal with and sometimes not so much. I think going into this episode something that is equally as important equally as important as you know, tapping into your purpose and try to figure things out or you know, doing something that scares you I think before you can get to that place being Yourself and being comfortable with yourself. I think it's one of the first steps to facilitating any of those previous things. Or are chip just starting starting a new beginning when you embrace the skin that you're angry you embrace yourself when you embrace your discomforts when you embrace you. It makes it very hard for people to come to you with their opinions their ideas. What they were thinking that would be best for you self comfortability. Like what is that to me? That's an array of things. That is knowing. How strong you are knowing how sensitive you are knowing how? Cool, you are even when nobody else thinks that about you knowing how unique you are what that means. You know being unique is one of those things that they teach you about when you're young when you're a kid, you know, that's a unique name. you know, they usually relate unique to the word weird like a nice way that people were taught to sometimes identify with things that are weird and we think of weird we think of things that are different but unique is just that it's an attribute, you know to a person a place a thing that helps Define who they are and when you are comfortable with your uniqueness, baby, that's a beautiful thing when you're comfortable with your Louis when you're comfortable with your discomfort knowing that it exists and yeah, I don't like that being able to express that articulate that say that right that show that again like I personally think that you should personally think that those are things that you should embrace being Okay with your shortcomings your looks your weight self-esteem. Your status all those things that we think are so so so significant in our makeup, you know doing things at your own pace staying in or creating your only the people that are most comfortable with themselves like they are at their at peace with themselves. And when when they say that they don't care what other people think. Be they truly mean that. This is something that does not always just happen overnight. Like you will probably listen to this and tomorrow you will just you won't just feel yes yesterday. I wasn't comfortable with myself. But right now today I and it's a process. It's something like anything. It's it's good and it's worth it. It's something that has to be worked on. But it is very possible. You take small steps, you know, I think initially something very very important is to change your mindset change how you think about things change how you feel about things change how you process things change how you react to things when we can You know. Be slow to take and quick to give because we're comfortable with knowing whatever happens. You're not losing anything. You know what we can say what Lisa, it's me. Oh, I'm blanking on I'm going 7:30 when we can stop doing that and you know stare at a person sit back and think like Mmm Yeah. Wow, you said that okay. I'm cool with no one else that you think and I'm okay with know what I think about myself and I'm not going to give you that to me that's part of the Journey of being comfortable with yourself knowing that you don't have to show up to every finger invited to whether that be in the literal sense or figuratively you all got to argue about things. Maybe like you once did because you comfortable how you really feel and what you really think about whatever issue might be at hand whether that means literal. Yeah. I really don't want to be around those people. So I'll sit this one out. It's okay to miss something being comfortable with knowing that you would rather stay home with your dusty headscarf on didn't wash your ass for maybe 15 16 hours knowing that you will get Wait, just not right now because you are comfortable low thing around that is okay. Your peers are going to call you and tell you you're a buster if they're going to tell you that you missed it and you needed to be here and you're going to say to yourself now is good where I was at is exactly where I needed to be why because when you practice being comfortable with who you are It really is like a game-changer like imagine like imagine. We live on a planet where there's millions of people and some people believe it or not. We're rather emulate somebody else like for what? I'm saying this stuff out loud, but we really really like thinking about it. Like why exactly what I want to be. Come on that what exactly do I gain live at? Well, let's see first I have to put myself aside to now recreate what I think someone else has or is doing that takes time and that takes effort. Would you really not want to be the person who you are? Which means you don't have to think about what you're doing because naturally when you're yourself you just do you You would put that aside to move how somebody else is moving. I personally wouldn't. Now I'm not doing that. I think today we have social media and the images that are displayed in front of us all of us. It's like this perfect kind of thing this perfect place. Everyone has these perfect looks and these perfect. Teeth these perfect dress these perfect every single thing check this out. I I have almost next to no breast and I am so comfortable with knowing that that part of me exist and when you see me, you see that it exists to but because I already know is there and I've already embraced it. You really can't make me feel bad about it. You know what? I mean? Like imagine how many times in my life I've been. You know encountered with comments about these these little brush that I have not to mention one is one is smaller than the other like most people are so they told me but my name is minor noticeable, but I'm not dying over here. I know. Dr. Miami is this I know that if that's something that I'm losing sleep at night over exactly where I could go what I could do, but I'm cool. I'm cool with that. I'm cool with this Lulu big city little city, that's part of me. So I'm okay, you know people have all their perfect possessions and they're perfect what I bought and they're sold not perfect. So will we see the fly exterior? Sometimes they're homeless or days women are really really sexy. But he called himself public figures but they're hungry like you got to figure out like what you really really comfortable with. So if you comfortable with being fly but being broke, that's what you're going to do this message, then you will not receive because you're going to say that I don't know what I'm talking about and there's nothing like living the kind of life that you live. But when you're alone and nobody's there and your peers with the prized possessions, they not pulling up next to you because there's our borrow to you know, what that feels like, you know, you're saying to yourself why exactly am I doing this what exactly am I what I what am I gaining? You know, we do things we're gonna barf friends cause she gonna bawl her friend close. He going to come pick you up in a bar called why you got on the borrowed clothes with the ball bag and that's really not who you are. Like you're right. Now you don't have it. You don't have it and when you get it and you want to go by it like ye be talking about that's what you're going to do until you realize that's just that was ways. And you know, we got to experience that but learning how to be comfortable what you have at the time when you have it and when your time is coming and it shows up and your glow up comes with that. It was Allah is part of the process. So being true to yourself and you know exuded the you and yourself. Yeah, you want to get so much further in life. It's probably not going to see that way. If you're scrolling on a gram or any social media website looking for you know for for whatever you think is better than what you what you have or feeling like you're inadequate because you don't have those things like you what you have probably is more true than what you think these people appear to be but they but they spoil him. You have to look into yourself and like yeah, I took it by myself. I'm very useful. I'm very goofy. I adore my family and friends, but sometimes I'm alone awake sometimes I want to be dolo. I want to eat by myself. I want to sleep alone. I love to shop alone. I sometimes you gotta get one with yourself treat your own self, you know show up for yourself. flatter yourself Will you have the ability to do those things for yourself looking for other people to do it for you or having expectations that you're not good enough because it's not being done for you. Sometimes you have to take yourself out. Sometimes you got to sit back with yourself and check you out walk past the mirror like, okay. I see you but you exist you while you the person the individual you can be a statement. You can be a movement. It's nice when you have people that show up with you and you know company is cool, but you got to know that. You can be real for yourself, especially before you fake Jacks for other people. Like what I got is what you're going to get you're going to get me. Mia who looks Dusty most of the time but my teeth are always clean and my face is always washed. That's who I am. I accept that being of myself. You have to learn to be self-confident, you know that will usually help or boost how you feel about yourself at all times that doesn't entail being cocky or necessarily shitting on people but thinking highly of yourself, like I said changing how you feel about you. Well normally You know God people how with how excuse me but how they feel about you having a dress you what have you they take in you know, I don't think there's a fine line between being yourself and being cocky. Oh, I think there's a very thick line. I think it's you know, it's it's almost like two different sides of the spectrum because when you are into yourself, it's not a public service announcement. It's just you are. That's the answer yourself again. I don't Manatee and look at me. Look at me. It's more. So even if you don't look at me, like I still feel this way about myself. So what difference to me if you got glasses on and your faces turn the other way. I just may very well not stand in front of you. You don't even have to see me but none of that matters when I'm comfortable with me. I know I exist straight up like I need for these listeners that Apps me feel like that may feel like they're struggling with being this when in front of these people and another way in front of these other people don't get me wrong not everybody's going to get the same you and not because that's not who you are. But I mean when I can see you You know, I can like a totally different individual or I've known you for a long time and I've never seen these appearances come out of you and bang, you know, maybe somebody who you might think. It's somebody you start morphing. I would be taking the back. You know, I'm not going to put you on blast but I'm definitely a little date of item and I'm going to store that shit like yeah. A little awkward I may or may not even call you out on it. But when I see it happen again, and again, it's definitely like, okay. We have a situation here. Yeah, I like you. You may have seen that with your friends sometimes even with your family. He's alter egos or personalities come out of them, you know performing and putting on shows because maybe they think who they are is not good enough now, they like everybody's dysfunctional family. Yeah, because everybody got a portion attacked within that's part of why your family is your family. And why some people rather be at your house for Thanksgiving and Christmas dinner or whatever holiday you celebrate versus they own cuz they get a glimpse of that realness. Sometimes it's a little unhealthy, but it is very real and I rather know that I don't gotta sit with my legs crossed and make sure no elbows on the table and I don't have to do all of that like you pull up on me and my family Are we bugging out? Well, I was in the morning because that's where you know, and when you come in the presence of us, that's what you're going to get. You're not going to get a take it one on one just because for us that's us being who we are and I and I encourage that I encourage you to express your disdain for things that don't make you happy Or that you just you're not okay with because rather than pretend like you can you shed your might bring some light to a situation like your word man? Cuz I really want to go either thank God you said that because I was hoping that I was not trying to go up in there and be like this. You never know. Your honesty can break the ice on a situation where perhaps the person that you With our next to they thought that they had the fake Jack. I've been in places that I've been around people quote unquote trying to impress me. But such a turn-off like please don't spend your time trying to do nothing impressive for me or having conversations using jargon that I really don't want to go digging down into sat study guides 101 to figure out what it means. We don't have to do that. If you say something mean I don't know what you're talking about. That is exactly what I'm going to say to you. Not worrying about what you're going to think when I tell you I don't know what that means. That is me being comfortable with myself if you're going to invite me to somewhere and show me a menu with things that I'm unfamiliar with. I am not going to twist up my face, but I am going to inquire or I just may very well Google it while I'm next to you because I don't know that is part of me being comfortable with myself. You just gotta know that. Be authentic you is probably what people really like about you. So when you show somebody something about yourself that's not real and then you are you know, the real you is being displayed is conflicting and then people start processing like so we when you was so so now so which one is you are which one? One is your video. My eyes are darting back and forth right now. You guys can't even see me because this thing these kind of things happen on a regular basis. We have to continue to do things present day with in our lives that we are comfortable with. I'm not sure how many of us are comfortable with being uncomfortable performing or faking jacks. For other people, you know, sometimes we have to focus on ourselves. And and that will help us, you know provide a feeling of comfort that you don't have to spend time searching for outside of yourself. So if you look within you what you get on the exterior is secondary because you're full and your hole. Before you step out, you know, it's like going out and needing drinks to be to have a good time or to be feeling like you, you know, you living right? I'm gonna go out and you might be looking at me like she's got to be thirsty and I just might be like I drink anything tonight and I'm having a really really really good time and I'll be okay with that. And I and I want you to know that I'm I'm sincerely. Embracing Myself by doing exactly what it is. I really want to do rather than doing what looks cool doing what the masses are participating in we gotta Embrace who we are. Like I said Embrace What Makes You Different and or unique people around you Dad may make you feel like you're unique your uniqueness or your quirkiness on your witness, whatever were they want to subject you to and you know, they put you down about it make you feel a kind of way you you have to put a stop to that you have to say uh-oh or please stop. You know people who make you feel down for being who you really are, they need to be identified and need to be called out because most times that's probably just a defense mechanism for them. Yeah. Let me laugh at her hahaha me why they suffer is from surreal silence shit and he can't talk about it. So they're going to use you as a scapegoat to make you feel uncomfortable so they could boast, you know boost. Ourselves and both about shit about themselves. That's really not going to talk about. Like I said be alone do things with yourself. I think that's a really good way to learn how to be comfortable. With oneself is being by themselves, you know, sometimes we get jammed up into the relationships friendships. Situation ships because we over here. Like I said, fine not being true to who we are and for life to be seen in despair because yeah, I thought that you know, I did that there really accept me ma'am. I gotta accept you for being who you are more than anybody else that you could ever imagine being and you know when the car a close and the lights are dim and people could sit back and like yo, damn she official. Can he do we help me down Dan what I'm going to be called a person those people that they'd be frightened to and be performing for and I can like they cool with but they really not they'll never make those comments about those care about those cats just because they can't cuz you you not be a real with yourself. So you can't think that you can feel those kind of weighs about people. You know don't want that typically know who you are. So your homegirl your childhood friend that nobody sees, you know, your diary that you keep away from your mix. Yeah, like you hold up to a different standard, but imagine if you had everybody said I standard how smooth life would be for you because you didn't have to pretend like I encourage you all to spend time with yourself and and essentially do what you can for yourself straight up go walking in the mall. Make some music in the studio take your journal in the bathroom. Take a hot shower and light a candle do something that will help you appreciate who you are change how you think stop being so negative. Stop thinking that things are impossible, you know be you being alone being itself allows you to Like I said value the authentic. person inside of you and you don't have to dumb that down for other people. Take that advice for me know that when you see me, I am going to be me. I am not. Walking around with my pinky in the air looking like Sunday's best dress 96% of the time. All right, maybe 86 percent of the time because I'm comfortable. I'm comfortable with myself. It's important to encourage you to do the same. Maybe no one delivers this kind of message. Maybe no one says You look beautiful that way. I like your beard when it's a little scruffy your tuck the your Chuck teases dog, but they cultured like you got to feel you before somebody else could feel you and if you lack that for yourself building grow it the things that I mentioned that I suggested, you know that you could do go to the movies for though logo to eat. Go to Starbucks. Go to the park and sit on the bench and watch the birds. Figure is he figuratively and literally like just go do something? different not for the sake of being different but for the sake of Desiring a little alone time to see like to see how you feel when you're not with the crowd to see if you're okay. When you move in by yourself to see if you feel fine doing what nobody else wanted to do but knowing that's what you really want to do. So you go do it anyway. Be that person for yourself. I guarantee you it will build yourself comfort knowing that you can count on yourself to pick yourself up. We put a lot of power into other people resort to putting that back into yourself, you know, take care of yourself. Show up for yourself pray for yourself. Hey for yourself, do these things knowing that yes. This is what I wanted to do and I successfully completed that task. Check it off your bucket list travel alone. Just just just do it. Okay, again, these things are not overnight changes, but learning to find ways to express yourself. Comfortably will definitely help with you feeling comfortable about choices and decisions that you make even when nobody else does. We don't want to be feeling broken or less than when or if you know, you're disappointed people are going to disappoint you you don't have to disappoint yourself. And rolling with yourself and taking care of yourself and doing things for yourself or all positive things and ways to live without disappointment. Take it from me. Take my advice. And if this doesn't work out in your favor, which I'm almost certain it will please let me know. Let me know about the times that you cared more about yourself and put effort into yourself better than work for you. That's it for tonight. I think this episode may be into segments. I apologize for that. But I think that this message of promoting being comfortable with oneself. It's so so so important and you know, like I said, we were kids they try to tell us about standing out because you weren't meant to be you know, you don't have to fit in you stand out and That's I think that's where we at. Just just be yourself like be you. That's a beautiful thing and it feels safer and sometimes more comfortable to be in a group being a trio. Do you know being a crowd but it feel real good when you could pull up on the crowd. By yourself and know that I ain't even tripping. I don't even feel some kind of way. Yeah, but do that again. I'll meet you there. Try that try that and see how much stress. you lack you won't have you'll be free of keep me posted about it. This is Rise checking out. Enjoy.","– ""I'm not losing anything.

And when you're making podcasts, I think you need an even more try talking to yourself for 10 minutes in a dark room and taking yourself. Seriously not possible not possible. Oh, so a little bit about what this podcast is all about. I want to start with what this podcast isn't I think that there's a lot of really great podcasts out there that talk about Wisconsin Sports already. There's a lot of people that know what the hell they're talking about on those podcasts. We don't we definitely do not know we're not experts I think the most sports winning of sadhana really been the high school level and not That's a really done anything since then you could you could freshman year rowing if you really want to count. Okay freshman, you're rowing. All right, cool. True. I remember we all got recruited to the Wisconsin Badgers rowing team. If you are over like six 480 pounds, you got a letter you get a letter. Yeah. I also wrote those letters to those kids know you were recruiter I had to recruit. Okay, so we do have a little bit of badger experience here on the podcast joining us today. Yes, sir a little bit more about what this podcast. Is not this podcast will not provide you up-to-the-minute coverage on anything now every once in a while, we'll hit some breaking news such as the Antonio Brown released today by the Patriots scoop. I hope this is still recording it is okay. All right, we might be able to trim that out. We might not anyway, we keep going. We also don't have any journalistic credibility. It's not a zero, none coming scientist trying to help get in the Sports World couple biologist stretching our legs out here a little bit. So we're going to see how this goes. Goes without saying we don't have any training to do this. We're using an app that I'll say its name once they pay me to do it, but they have a lot of nice tools and you're making this really user-friendly for us. So we're just gonna see what we can do. We also will recommend that you don't take any fantasy or Sports gambling advice from us now, we will talk about that quite a bit on this show, but please do not hedge any actual money on any BS that gets set on this podcast on the over a Leo. Now I want to sweat the onion so a little bit about what this podcast is is and what it's going to be. It's going to be conversations between just a bunch of guys who have some similar interests some different interests. There's gonna be a lot of different people popping in and out of this podcast. I hope if it survives more than episode of do couple of guests couple of guests. We're going to have we got Brewers guy who reads the blog comments online. QA websites, we've got Minnesota Vikings fans that I you know, God forsaken friends with and so they're going to be popping in every once in awhile. There's going to be some banter is going to be some trash talk is going to be steaming hot takes completely uneducated and founded most of the time but they're going to be hot. I'm gonna be in your face and then we're, you know, just going to talk about what we hope. Somebody else likes to listen to I know I like to listen to it. So maybe you will maybe you won't but so we're gonna we're just going to go ahead. Alright and we're back after that riveting intro Nate the Great how you doing? I'm doing well doing well. So big part of what we're going to try and do at the time filler podcast is get to know these guys and what they want to talk about what sports as Nate mentioned before he's got a season of Wisconsin Badger rowing that I think we'd all love to hear a little bit about why don't you want to tell people that story? Yeah, so, you know at so Roaches the orientation every year we we get recruited if you're above the height of 6 feet pretty much and you know, they saw me I was a little thin little undersized but try it out be better than you are. Now you look pretty thin to die. You know, I was a little thicker that ground. Yeah. Yeah, she's on but but you know really wasn't hard to make the team if you want to play d 1 and d 1 sport. I'd recommend growing but yeah overall it was a good time good time good experience. Good good. Any particular reason that you didn't go out for your sophomore year, why did the rowing team lose you you know, it was hard. Yeah. That's that's not a great excuse. No, but you know I wanted to I wanted to take my time Deuce do other things ended up with you here and right and in lab, that's right. So, I don't know that I'd be here right now. Doing this podcast if it weren't for my lack of drive in that area, you know, they say God has a plan for everything and it seems like time filler podcast was was Manifest Destiny. Yeah. Now that I think of it, I think if I were to make that decision again, it would have been a lot easier knowing I'd end up on this podcast see Saul you all your freshman rumors out there. Keep in mind if it gets too hard there might be something better for you on the other side. Yeah. All right, I'll save you so Nate has been involved with more than just rolling as of late. I believe you have a little bit of a bike ride. You're going on this weekend big big bike ride, you know, we together do little bit of cancer research, which is awesome. But this bike ride is a fundraiser for cancer research. So actually we have we've had grants in the past, right? Yeah, and we've been funded by the funds raised by this bike race, right, right. So doing a hundred miles. Hundred miles lightwork the century the century the century is something kind of cool is I've only like 50 miles Max before that. So I'm going to have to have to double the mileage. Well, I mean, I've done it once you can do it twice, right? It doesn't have anything that is what the I don't know is that the kids are saying that's what the kids are saying these days. All right. Well, how about some more local news? We've got a big game here at Camp Randall this weekend a game big blue coming to town. What do you think about that? What does a we're going to save the score prediction, but what do you expect to see here on Saturday man? I mean Jonathan Taylor down the throat sounds of throw Bucky by million, but you buy a Millions. It's it's gonna happen. You know, I don't know what Michigan has Jim Harbaugh Jim, right Jim Jack Jimmy James Aunt Jim friends. Call him Jim. Okay. Yeah James James. He's kind of on the thin ice for his job. I think so. He's like, yeah, Michigan needs a win. Looks like more of a figurehead than a successful head coach at this point. I would agree. I mean lots of recruiting you want to talk about over ranked programs in the nation. The Wolverines have got to be up there last was it last week against Navy two weeks ago. They took my last week two weeks ago against Navy wenzhou T may be just about right at the ship their the end to yeah, I did there a greater voice. Everyone likes a good pun all aboard. So I would have to think that the Badgers offense Has the same rushing ability at least with Jonathan Taylor is what Navy did all right with a little bit of razzle-dazzle in the past and Department little bit of little bit surprised little bit Yeah, Razzle Dazzle Razzle Dazzle who you were then throw out there Jack Cohen, I as as my buddies know I'm I want to see grammar. It's early and often seems like I'm gonna have to wait a year for that. So Jack on it is Jack on it is that kind of is better than Jill stop it. No, stop it. Shut up. Stop it watch. Alright, so, let's see. I've also I've also got a little bit of an update here fantasy wise. Oh, I would say for all of you listeners out there who are going through a tough quarterback time Nate understands. You haven't seen much worse that I think no, I would say that. Let's see. You're rolling out Matthew Stafford In Case Keenum this weekend. Yeah, why don't why don't you talk to people about what your strategy is right now coming off Owen to write is trying to get some momentum going right? So, you know my fantasy team. I'm a I'm an old-time conservative fantasy player. I like I like the guys who were once good and then I like them on my team when they're currently bad. Yeah. It's always like a scheme is there well, Case Keenum great college quarterback. I love college quarterbacks. But so Case Keenum he I believe Is fit and fantasy actually has a good year. He has I think he's planning on the Bears, which that's not cool you down a little bit might have negative points this week. But Drew Brees got me negative points last week. So nothing's going to change their no gotta go up. But yeah, but between Matthew Stafford and Case Keenum, I originally had Cam Newton and Drew Brees both of which are out this week. So well Cam Newton questionable but projection of point zero. Row so what does that tell you not good? Yeah, it's questionable, but it's a zero point. So I mean, I think he was ruled out here earlier today. He's out breaking news you regular news. You heard it here first on the time filler podcast Cam Newton out for this we can get them out of your fantasy lineups. Yeah. All right. So we're gonna we're gonna wrap up this segment with with a little bit of hot takes I haven't come up with what we're going to call it. But I want your hottest Sports take heading into the weekend whether it's a prediction or a dismissal. Something that's gonna really ruffle the feathers of somebody in the audience. What do you got was Bucky by million not enough for you. Oh, wow Bucky by a million. All right, so so there's a score prediction. So thinking back on it, you know, if I do want to get a real real predict prediction here Antonio Brown is going to jail. Wow, yeah believe it's a civil case. So you're really going on a limb there. I think I think I think it's going to turn into a little bit more. Okay, I don't know much about it was between the helmet. I think I think yeah. Well, we'll see. Alright that is that is a Stevie hot take that civil cases going to end up putting him behind bars a political guy. But yeah, I think we're going straight to it. So so I'm gonna dive in here with my hat take for the weekend. Just going to say this the Jets and the Dolphins are setting historic standards for for money lines here this weekend. I believe we've got like a minus 20 and a half for the Dolphins and a - 21 for the Jets. And here's what I'm going to say. There was a wise man who once said he doesn't bet on football because the ball isn't round anything can happen if you want to turn 10 bucks into something fancy for the weekend think about putting some on the Jets of the dolphin just saying, I'm just saying you saying you want That on day I'm not worried about the over-under. I'm taking the or the money line right taking the line. Oh, man, you put you put 10 bucks on the Jets this weekend. You're walking out with some money for Monday morning with Sam Darnell the mono. I got that freshman year of college. He's getting it is is what third year in FL you kidding boys Peak late some boys Peak late. Alright. Alright. Well that does it for us? Here on the time filler podcast. We're going to see how many sites wanna put this crap out there. See what sticks next time. I'll be joined by possibly Nate again possibly different guess you just don't know what you're gonna have the time filler. So thanks again for joining and go Bucky go pack go bruised making a playoff push. Great time to be Wisconsin sports fan.","– Wisconsin's University of Wisconsin-Madison rowing team won the NCAA title last year for the third time in four years, and the team's coach says he's ""thrilled and honored"" to have the team back in the title game after a one-year absence.

I'm your host Matthew carry. It's a pleasure to have your company once again joining me today to do. Dress everything in my chest 8:30 and review and preview much. They 31 is the lovely Eva Eva. How you doing? How are you? Good. Thank you very much. Excellent. And of course, we've once again brought in a Val field becomes English Twitter man, Elliot Turnbull Elliot. How you doing today? Yeah, I'm good. Thanks. Hope that everyone had a good Easter. Yes, of course the wonderful weekend of eating plenty of chocolate and of course watching plenty of football and we had plenty of goals on the weekend which leads us to our first game, which is Heidenheim versus sankt Pauli Heidenheim comfortable winners three ghosts in the over the Hamburg side marks natural opening the scoring on 18 minutes and then two goals in the space of three minutes from Nicola David on Making it's a nice easy sweep for Frank Smith sides either. I'm going to start with you. It's probably best to start with sankt Pauli. It looks like their potential tilts of the playoff is over and it hasn't been a particularly bright star under your Luke. I knew and I think it's was once again really poor 45 first 45 minutes the same against the media and and yeah, it's Like to concede three Golds under 30 minutes. It's really bad. And then you don't deserve to have a saying and in the promotion and I think most of those aren't quality friends. I talked to already like they didn't expect to get promoted. But still they should look out that they don't end the season was a bunch of defeats. Yeah, greedy. I mean it would it would almost waste what has been a pretty decent season for the sides and Elliot you look at Heidenheim a great win for them. You know, we spoke prior to starting the recording that they've been a bit off. So to speak comfortable win and surprisingly they're still very much in the hunt for that for at least the playoff spot. Yeah, definitely only two point mile off other born in sin third, which is remarkable given where the work a month and bit ago. But yeah against going to go absolute self-destruction for don't power lead agency few teams have a word recent record in the league than them. But yes for some reason Frank Schmidt has been he loves playing against FC st. Pauli, especially home prior to this it was for home game. Four victories is not made up five and five just to add to the misery. But again precious got to be building on leak. I change of manager usually expect some sort of positive reaction that's just not happened with them probably and yeah very much looking forward for both of them to tell their own in a few weeks because their team objects of confidence at just that they've got nothing to play for now. They're just completely busted it which is surprising given how strong they looked. Early on in the season. Yeah and a team that isn't lacking any confidence whatsoever is paderborn and they were one of the big winners on matchday 30. They beat Horse Town kill two goals to 1 at the holster and study on Messiah or could go opening the scoring and then it was all paderborn type Raga and Christopher actually a giant getting the two goals and it means that paderborn move ahead of onion billion into third place and they sit only two points behind Hamburg and Elliot's we spoke about it last week that part of born were in a really good position to to potentially overtake or neon and now you'd almost say that they're in a good position to even eclipse homburg. Yeah, what agree completely over a lot. They had a bomb with a real winners of the game weak teams around them talking points. It was crucial that they got the victory at Keele. And I mean, it's bizarre that the teams are top seem to be having blips and form don't know if they're choking or not. Whereas in stark contrast that part of almost being absolutely on fire won four of the last five drawing the other game if there's a time to get form and really Conan had momentum for that potential third place play-off. It's now and two points of Hamburg Inn in second. There's no reason why they couldn't LeapFrog them given that they can't find a win at the moment. So as annoying as people may find it seemed kinda bomb flying well credit where it's due they deserve to be where they are agreed. They played great football. They had plenty of shots on Dominic riemann's goal and and it has to be said kill hold out for as long as as they could but eventually paddleboards dominance really took over and and Eva, you know, I guess from a cure perspective that essentially kills off the promote sort of the playoff attempt for them. What do you think? What did you think of their overall performance against paderborn it and what should we look out for them going forward? Well, I think it was the game we expected it to be last week, but it's Also, the thing that we talked about potable is really strong and I think here may have like taking it all too easy after their first goal. Like they had a really good first half but it's yeah it there weren't really after that first goal. They should have had more chances or use their chances to higher the score sheet on their behalf, but they didn't and then it's really really difficult to to win against pas de born if they get one back or so. So yeah, I think we talked about it last week that this is going to be like a decision. Whoever is going to win will be more likely to have anything in the promotion and that was yeah, it was decided and that's why I think he'll is going to end like 5 5 V place or so. But yeah, they have really really good season which we have to say. We spoke about a plenty of times there were better than expected with a come with a new coach and all that. So still have a lot of They showed a lot of Courage throughout the season. I have indeed healed me. They may feel hard done by both. I know that we've discussed today are fair amount, but I could go I scored a perfectly good goal after a lovely cross from Mateo contact, which was ruled out for offside. So potentially next season with that introduction of the technology that goal counts could have been a different story. But to be fair, I believe the three points were rightly due for potable. Yeah, agreed on that one. Another team that took a massive step in the way of avoiding relegation was dinner with Dresden three-nil over the league leaders after cone Eric berko chiming in with a brace on 12 the torment and the 67th Harris do leave each with a nice goal as well. It means that Dresden are almost automatically safe from the director relegation place and Eva, you know the it was a an interesting performance, I guess from Dresden. They didn't have a lot of the ball, but when they went forward, they took their chances and they took the three points. Yeah. Definitely. I think two people that were mainly involved word olegovich and bakal. I think they were the main part of the device and game and what was really interesting that Kony wasn't in the squad. I think there was a bit surprising for many people but I think Grayson had this Aid Wonder feed in their minds and wanted to give their fans something bad because they were amazing supporting away in Kern last year. And I you saw the current had a lot of difficulties to come back into the game and then as he cites a huge win for today stand It's cone. Third game parole without win. Yeah, and I think Kelly it would be wrong of us to not talk about the defensive. Mistakes from from Kern the three goals. They all from long balls or in every way the third goal obviously coming from a set piece but really suspect suspect defending but as they say if you have the chance to take you must take it and Dresden certainly did. Yes, I agree completely that is having incredible to watch out. Especially the first two goals is just a long hoof from The Dresden goalkeeper, which somehow cut through there sa defense and credit where it's due to decent finishes past Tebow home, but I don't know why it happened in this much but they just couldn't defend against the long Ball. But this game is a perfect example. Why is The Possession start is one of the most useless? Phones in football think if you look at the stats, they make quite funny reading the visitors way from home. They had six seven percent of the ball dominated possession, but really did nothing with it. They have no lethal touch didn't really create any chances and with with Justin really three four, click or chances and you've got three goals are so got to give credit to Christian feel think his tactics were brilliantly work very very well nullified. Can call them on the break with the long ball a few times and yeah, it's really turned it around there and think good appointment. It was practicing to bring him in and yeah should see dress them in need site illegal next year that we should I will take a quick breather will go to our group two games in just a moment. We'll start in firts when they host it on your on Billy. And so that's kind of how we start our group two games in firts. As they hosted on your own balloon and the spoils were shared in this one one goal a piece your shoe. Mm. He's opening the scoring and then three minutes after Daniel caterer. Well was sent off but a very good second half performance by greater efforts Marcus caligiuri scoring on 67 minutes. Then onion themselves reduced to ten men nickel L rap was the man Scent of a funny old game this one Elliot's this just I just Just can't help but feel this was a missed opportunity for on your own and that second half was really ordinary. Yeah, I think if anything we don't were lucky to even come over Point here. They were abysmal lacks any real Christmas going forward May talking points from the game would stupid red cards either side one was a petulant push after a bad Challenge from Paul yet has other one was just disgusting to footing challenge, which was rightly so red card for rat, but I mean contrasted to paderborn we're going to the This end of the season this is when you want to be getting good form, you know, really playing well and truly on did they just can't find him a win-loss to on a bounce now prior to that the drones three in a row again with Harris foul. There's even couldn't drop in point. This is an ideal position to really cement your claim for that third position now, but again, it's a waste opportunity and if we're gonna go on form and which team you would rather not play at the moment other born are looking hot some favorite to potentially solidify that third or even second spot. Yeah. It is theirs for the taking is either we have to bring under greater for a good point for them against the team that is now sitting in fourth position that they've looked better under Stephen light. Although they've certainly improved defensively and and especially like that second half when it was ten men of peace. They really had it really looked like they were going to go and take the Yeah, definitely. They were closer to school then on your own which is a bit surprising because for food the season is more or less over. They won't get relegated or won't get promoted. And then you expect on your own to be the team that invest more in the game and it wasn't that way and they like they were 40 minutes or so or 30 minutes. They were one man down and and it was really extraordinary performance. You could say against a team you might fear to to concede many goals. And yeah. Yeah, I think they're definitely better than more stable in the defense than there were before and yeah, you could you can see that Stephen that I could bring some confidence back into the team. I'd say he certainly has an A team that could use a little bit of confidence. Haas vow they were held to a 100 draw to ask a burger our Philip zulekha opening the scoring. He took advantage of a mistake by yulian pull us back at the set piece and then manual Vince Homer in his first start for Hartsville capping that off with a goal. That's not a particularly good point for heartfelt. They continue to drop points at home. They actually have more away points this season than they do at home and even Eva I think they're starting to get a little bit nervous in Hamburg as teams are starting to not only close but potentially surpass. Yeah. Definitely. I think okay, you have to say paderborn as I said before is the winner of this match day, but like our isn't the best team in the league. It's like though one draw one of book called draw against cone was was more As win a win for them, especially concerning their confidence but against our it's two less definitely and if they pay like that if they go into the playoff spot, they I'm not quite sure that they will be the winner because it's like there were so many mistakes. Not only by Paula's bag but everywhere Air and it isn't enough just to play 45 minutes or being eager to win this game. It's not enough. Yeah, and it almost makes you question that had the makeup of the squad. They've been obviously in the top three for so long but this is it has to be said under Hannah's fall for this is the first time they've looked vulnerable and teams are starting to figure out figure them out. They've been atrocious at home. I think they've really let their home fans down in many games this season. He's and and to allow teams to almost dictate in such a way is really poor for them. And and you know, if they continued the trend of form that they may miss out altogether and that in itself, would it be extraordinary and and Elliot? Certainly? We will talk about it later on in the preview, but with a result like this, it makes their upcoming fixtures. So important. Hey did it does completely and especially with palpable on winning? The pressure really is on they can feel them breathing down their necks. Yeah, just agree with what said you have to feel for how it's all funds and Hannah's wolf is under increasing pressure. Personally. I don't know what's going on. I don't know where that they're loving the league so much sir. First year of psychic. One of the other one has to want to stay for a few more years because The in the world but just- tactics trying to grind out one-nil victories home away from home and when our are coming to such a big and historic Club in dictating how the games being played along those have got to be ringing those tactics maybe work in the Bundesliga more when you're all of the small teams, but coming down. I don't have fairly high expectations of Hamburg the budget larger than most their players are incredible, but for some reason they just can't and have a performance that the hunters wolf. And yeah, I mean just looking at this weekend's their trip to London Berlin this weekend that is a potential season decider for both clubs are which we'll discuss later but pressure is on that is two teams that probably don't have well don't have the same amount of pressure with darmstadt and barking they played the only new new of the match day. Both teams had their chance to living hinges are had the best of those Elliot's probably wasn't the particular a particularly eye-catching fixture. But I mean, I think Demetrius grim. What'ss and Robert saw in the end wouldn't be too opposed to sharing the points. Yeah. This definitely wasn't one for the neutral. Yeah. I mean, I guess it's a clean sheet away from home and appoints a bottom dumpsters. Well, they keep up their unbeaten form whose form is incredibly changed since doctors came in and yeah from a tactical point is quite clear to see that both coaches knew each other. Well, obviously kilometers before Dom start. He was head of our yoga and youth team and yeah tactics potentially canceled them out. Both teams sort of seemed to know how the other one was going to play Chances are few and far. Satan inside hint Isaiah had to 1/2 chance one. Okay, where he fired a volley just over the crossbar but appoint is fair and to be honest. It's 90 minutes that I'm never going to get back that is indeed leave those group two games behind us and we'll take a quick break group three offerings are just around the corner. We're going to start in bielefeld when they hosted Ingolstadt. Let's carnal Goethe. Kitty Yes, and we start the group 3 games in Armenia. They hosted Ingolstadt and well, I crucial win another one of the big winners were Ingolstadt 3-1 the final score. My cell gasps took advantage of Stefan Ortega's mishandling in the first half for a set-piece Stefan Kutcher. Yep. He's still exist. He scored just after half time and then Thomas applied or who of course will be gone for two to Dusseldorf at the end of the season he Chimed in for gold Andreas Vogel stammer who of course was courted by English that he scored armenia's one and only goal the win season course that only a point behind magdeburg in 16th Place, but we'll start with Armenia Eva very very cool. But please take us well, I think you could say the first half was quite like there's probably first half we I'd say we were the dominant team I think especially for guys I'm I had plenty of chances. They Armenia was I'd say the better team until the English dad go but once again using your chances, it's very important. It doesn't matter who you playing. You always should use them and I mean you didn't and yeah, then that mistake by Ortega. I don't want to talk about it too much because he was a really important factor. The season so I think he's granted one mistake. I think we shouldn't talk about that too much and then that second have apparently a mini has some problems with being awake at the start of the second half. Yeah coach Kerr and I know that he like I forgot that he still exists and then that 3-nil was a huge mistake by Florian heart. It's like you could watch him lose the ball like Riously, if you look at that goal, you can see that he has no idea what he's doing going bag and then have of our dear friends are saying no you got the ball. No, you got it and nobody got it except cleaner. Yeah, and then yeah, at least we had one goal on the score sheet with with Foggers Emma, which was a good really good free. Kick. It was his first converted free Kick this season. He tried to plenty of times. But yeah, it's not a like I'm not really happy I make travel back from vacation eight hours. Got up at 6 a.m. On Saturday. It's beautiful and I love my team. It's so good to travel through half Germany to see my team getting defeated. It's so great. And even of course was the only one who predicted that Ingolstadt was gonna win that game. So I guess Elliot it's a crucial win obviously finger will start since Thomas also has taken over seven points out of a possible nine two wins on the road a point now behind magdeburg. There's see that they're slowly making form and add at this time of the season of this is the time to pick up form paddleboard. We've spoken about at just our will but English at now starting to pick up points at the right time and they are very much a player in this push for the playoff yet. Definitely just the one point now after magdeburg lost weekend separating them from 16th spot. So yeah two wins for the last three it is the right time. Stop picking up fold. But yep, glad to hear that either had a nice Easter Sunday watching, you know Fells, I'm going to defend Ortega slightly here. It was definitely his mistake for the gold but personally think even worse wasn't manual little defending. He just fell asleep in the Box Stood Still didn't pick up his player easy had a home and overnight house was rightly feeding on the touch home because all three of those things Gunshot goals were just woeful woeful woeful defending which said that know usually you wouldn't associate with bielefeld. But yep credit where it's due single stack could could make a very very very late survival. They couldn't did. I know you've got no house had smoke coming out of his ear and his face was as red as a tomato speaking of a team that wears red. That is Ian Regensburg. They took on mags of pork one-nil. That marker grown up on 20 minutes getting the goal. It is taught the season Ian going to 7th magdeburg looking over their shoulder as we've said before Elliot not a whole lot got went right for magdeburg. They have to be really concerned now heading down the stretch that they could not only be caught but they could also see themselves going down at the drill again next season. Yeah, bug bug could have be heading straight back down huge win for for yarn but quite Scrappy am really tensed Shield far between again, it just comes down to when you don't want to lose your form Mike Burg. Yeah, the picked up a couple of decent draws the win incredible when against Hamburg, but yeah, that's now two defeats on the back. They're not playing with confidence. Weren't very inspiring to the weekends again yarn. So yeah, I mean huge pictures for both clubs this weekend, but English stack could it mean that hosting Justin? They've got little too playful despite their heroics home to could so I wouldn't be really surprised if they could Leap Frog magdeburg. Yeah. It's in the offing for them. And it's yeah, they've almost it's almost seems like the last few weeks. They've been it's with the Ian of the the Hamburg game they've been holding onto some to a massive advantage and now as they look at the table that massive event Advantage is just one team that is in the Drop Zone in last place is duisburg. They hosted son housing and they came from two guys behind to salvage a draw Andrew Woodson has continued his magnificent form. He should be wearing the red white and blue some would say and he proved so two guys for him. It's a good flight back from duisburg Harvard Nelson who's obviously tortellini clicks one of his favorite players and Kevin volts a scoring from the penalty spot just a few minutes before stoppage time giving duisburg a glimmer of hope Eva but it is really a glimmer of hope. We all probably would agree that it's going to be extraordinarily hard for them to stay up. But nonetheless they keep themselves just in the hunt. Yeah, I think what was important for their Ends is that they reacted to to or first half where they had more chances and sound Heusen was barely to be seen and liked. It was a copy of the first goal in the second half as well and just was really missing like Christy Shin in front of in front of the goal. But I think than 2,000 can live with one point way more. Do spoken there is no six games without a win guess who's going to be their next opponent. Just not going to predict anything for that Monday game because we all know how it's going to end. I think it was really important for them that they got back into the game that they saved a point, but it's two less for them. And I think no matter if they're going To win next week or not. They will go down. It does look very likely that they will and that concludes our review of match day 30 and coming up is our preview for the upcoming matches a massive week of football will take a quick break and we'll bring it all to you. Yes, so we welcome you to the match day 31 preview and we have some massive games to go through and none bigger than this one on your own Boolean versus Hamburg has fell fourth hosting second. But where will these teams be at the end of the match day that is to be determined. This is only the second ever meeting between the two sides and when they met in Hamburg, it was a two or Draw with La he scoring the equaliser in stoppage time Elliot. We spoke at nauseam eats each side really really struggling no wins in their previous five league matches for both sides. This is a season defining match for both teams. That is certain. Yep, and this one should be a thriller quite fun already. Both teams got the exact same form over the past five and neither team look like they want to leave the FICA Liga both joking when it matters, but Hamburg picked up more points away from home. They don't like taking the game and being that attacking side. So if anything that suits Hannibal's tactics a bit more here, so yeah, I would but Humbug, hit that long. Long long overdue. I went however from a neutral perspective. It will be a lot more exciting if we only on could get them because then that would just being with three games to go that would make it such an exciting finish to the league book is great though. It's so competitive and mean down from 2nd to 5th and hide mine feasibly any one of those teams could finish in the they could all be rotating. So Yeah, I would put my neck on the line and say Hamburg here, but I'm not sure how you say it. So it's a difficult one to call. Yeah, I'm going to sit on the fence the very tall fence. That is I like I say this one ending a goal of Peace can see on snatching a drawer late. I do agree with you though the tactics that onion like to play wil will play into the hand of Hannah's false side, but I can't I just can't see. Either team taking a win in this one either. Do you agree with Elliot that hamburger starts to win or do you agree with myself or do you think on Ian will take the three points? No, I agree with you Matthew. I think I have a drawl written down here as well. And I think the both team will focus on not making any mistakes and that's why it's going to be very poor fensively and maybe like a one all draw so but I don't see a winner. Yeah. I feel like we are Almost as neutrals in this scenario are waiting for the ultimate chaos scenario, which would see Heidenheim beating paderborn, which is the game. We're going to preview now. They take the win a draw in Copper Nick and then it's just total pandemonium heading into the final few games. This is only the fourth meeting between the two sides and when they met last time at the voice Arena, it was 5 1 2 paderborn, of course portable. One of the in-form sides of this seat at the moments and it perfectly poised to take that second position Eva. Do you see part of born holding the fort at home or do you think Heidenheim could really throw the cat amongst the pigeons here? No, I'd say it's again the paderborn wind. I was sort of right the last time you never know. But yeah, I think they're just they're really want to manifest or so. The third place or even like really really challenged on your own in-house foul. And I think they're just a bit more eager to win and that's we're going to put them on Elliott's would you share the sentiments or would you go in a different direction? Again it I I don't like predicting the drawers I could see this ongoing and then go all squared but it's clear to see what Frank's been were used to motivate. His players are having been humiliated 5-1 at home. They're going to be chomping at the bit to come and seek their revenge against Panda born. I can really see them coming out one thing to make up for that. Should yeah boss and thousand these are the to inform teams in the league. I want to fix the hired time when but I could see this being an entertaining score draw to be honest. Yeah, we certainly wait and see the last of our group on games is at st. Pauli. They host Ian Regensburg. The two sides are 8th and 7th respecting respectively if I could speak English, this is only the sixth meeting between the two sides. It's and Yan have won this fixture more than their opponents Marco gruner. And so I guess Adam Young are the top scorers with Frankie. Simbolo all paying all from yarn with two girls Elliot. This is a massive game in particular for Yost Luke why it has not been an ideal start is only of course the only been here for two matches. So we maybe have been a bit harsh but they've been very poor in first house in games and a team like Ian who are very Out on the road could take full advantage. Yep, I would agree completely there but pressure is on and I think even so for good disagree with my prediction here, but only the overdue when there's only so long as abysmal form can continue for I know that initially he's not a direct flights hopeful but given two to three weeks and I training ground try and get some of his ideas across I do. They will get back to winning ways here. And again, yep yarn. They got the one know when we can begin to Michael Berg, but even in that they weren't overly inspiring. So I'm gonna yep sit Madam Ireland predictors in Parliament. Well, I'm gonna just screw you and I'm gonna say that Jana is how shocking I'm gonna pick you on to win. I think they just have the tools. I think I think yeah, I mean they can take full advantage in that first half and I think that's where they'll do the damage it. It's like st. Pauli like under your the officer who Kai remnants of some slow cook pork ribs. They take a long time to get nice and tender and and get into that Peak sort of tasting area and I'm talking about food because I'm really hungry. But that's what they are. They take they take a long time to cook correctly. And then eventually they get better in the second half but good teams will put them away early Heidenheim did that. Bielefeld should have done that and I think yeah, no, we'll do that. So then Ava it goes to you. We have two separate results. I'm just going to take a hunch that you may be thinking different to both of us. No, so as Elliott might suggest a door already. I'm going to beg yarn here because for the same reason that you just said Matthew like some curly didn't even manage to get a win. Just us and and just going to say here that he and there's a better team than we are. So if some curly is not improving their really bad performance in the first 45 minutes there were definitely lose it if you're still okay, we'll find a way to improve that then they might get a point of out of it, but I'm not saying anything more than 1.4 then apparently they have it group one in the books group to in. Just a moment cone will host darmstadt and that's our first game. Yes, we start the group two games in Kern. They host dumb stats. This is the 12th meeting between the two sides and darmstadt have never won this mixture, of course cone are almost at the Pearly Gates of the Bundesliga, but they may have to wait just another week before they can taste promotion and Eva. I mean, it's we're probably going to just talk about killing here. It's a game. They should win obviously poor result last time out expect a response in front of the home fans. You expect Kiln to win. Yeah, definitely their home their way better and the past weeks then they are away I'd say so I definitely say it's going to be a win for concurrent. Would you share the sentiments? Yeah, it's ain't ya - I'm shocked why we try and put it in there because it wouldn't no one would have predicted Dresden beating curve or even Ingolstadt Armenia bath either for of course, but now as well as d'amigo Moses has done turning things around dumpster. I can't see past can have not been to not be like the best lately. Yeah their funds are going to be Expecting to win here. There's not one in their last three. So I'd expect a can with but wouldn't write off darmstadt. Obviously, they went 1-1 in Hamburg as well. But I think it's only a matter of time before can come win and really cement their spot back in the Bundesliga. Yeah. It's really hard to not pick them record is superb against armed stats that have one of the equal top scorers and Anthony my desk playing can't go past it. We will move on to to duisburg who play the Monday night kickoff against Armenia bielefeld. This is the 46th meeting between the two sides and all competition and duisburg have a good recent history over them unbeaten in their last four. They beat them in the cup this season. It looks in terms of history as if do Sports should win this game, but and after a poor performance against English at either the expectation will be an improved performance on Day, yes, and because like every statistic smolder speaks Romanian this week six gaming in a row without a win. I mean, yeah is the feeder induced book since 2009. But yeah, I do not think this will continue to go like, okay, I'd say it's going to be a draw. Because this book is still in a different place than English. Don't was when they travel to to bielefeld. But yeah, I do no think I mean he's going to win this. It's a tricky game to predict. I mean do sports records says a lot especially against Armenia, but I think I think the fact that they were so bad on the weekend. Like I can see Armenia getting a results against that defense who knows we could see six goals because both teams have been a bit iffy defensively. I don't know how you feel about this area. It's would you can you see any team getting a result in this game? Yeah, I can see Barbie to get a result. They're going to be expecting to bounce back from a woeful performance of the weekend. And yeah, there's a reason why these Burgers so low in the table, so I would expect I mean it's weird and really start to cement their place needs really good next season. Yeah. It's so it seems set in stone. It's almost waiting for the inevitable inevitable to happen and Team, that will be hoping that that's doesn't fall upon them as English that they of course host Dena more Dresden. They won this fixture last time out and it is the talk meeting. However in the previous 11 six of those have been draws. This one is quite a tough game to predict Elliot's at the Audi Sport Park. They haven't won Under New Management manager Thomas oral at home. Is this the day they do it. I can trick you want to predict? Yeah, I think part of the automobile in came mrs. Probably going to be one of the ones to watch in this game week both teens cream on the back of incredible results of the weekend who will be able to kick on personally. I see ending in a draw Paul though. That would be no good for English that really they will need to get pick up a Victorian to yeah, I think correct me if I'm wrong, but I don't think they've won. Mm speaking bottom a couple of months back now so that I'm not going to be expecting that in woeful all season, but it's a huge opportunity Dresden maybe obviously brilliant result against Kern but I mean the Champions are in town you're going to raise your game there. They've got nothing to play for maybe they'll be complacent which will allow Ingolstadt to win. But I yeah, I'm it's impossible to predict League. I don't know what why we try We do it for the fun of it. That's why we enjoy it either. How do you see this game going? I mean obviously Dresden as Elliot's reminded us coming off the highs of beating the leaders. Will they carry or will they fall? It's really really difficult to predict. I have Grayson written down as the winner. I think the problem for both sides is that there might have too much self-confidence. after winning on the weekend, I think that's the main thing they have to to focus on it's going to be really difficult for both sides because they play both teams played completely different opponent to to the previous week, but I still think that there is no might have some advantages here and because they don't have anything to lose and that's why why I think there might be a bit Yeah a bit more loose and playing and that's why I think I'd say they win. It will be an interesting fixture that is for sure. Our we've got three games left to preview. We're going to start that in San house and when they host Holstein Kiel, Yes, and we start in sand house and they host whole Stein kill. This is only the sixth meeting between the two sides when they met last time out host on kill were two one winners and interestingly enough kill have never won in sand Heusen. So Elliot's based on that. Can kill get of winning sound house and or will send Houston and Andrew Woodson be the difference. I think he'll can get a point not too sure about a win here. Sometimes them like inform team in the league at the moment picked up 12 points or potential 15 and It's A Small Miracle Hue Kushner has worked at the club. They can be full of confidence. Again Keel not nothing really to play for the got no promotion hopes anymore. So yeah. Sorry Betty man, boringly. I know. If potentially a draw here, but I think there's nothing stopping sound thousand increasing the dominant home form away against host and kill here. I don't know how you see this picture of panning out. It's a tough one, obviously son house and have improved it almost feels like they improved overnight and they went from being absolutely hopeless to just on fire and I'm not entirely sure I think the key I think I think and I've brought him up because He's been absolutely dominant force on houses. But if you know if I his Andrew wouldn't ability to influence the game and get on the scoresheet kill win the game. I'm pretty certain of that. There's been a Reliance and him to get them back up and he's done such he's done that but you know, they this is the kit that the good teams have more than one guy finding the back of the net and I don't think they've got that. Well they had It was slow as nobody he is injured so it will be interesting and I think Eva when you look at Keele, you know, you want to finish the season off strong lee-san housing isn't a particularly easy opponent, especially at home. What will they need to do to get the points here? And well, I think it's not that different to how they played against polar bond. They just like especially I think with Uncle gather they have A really good man up front and they think they will be eager to show a reaction to after taking the lead should lose a game and I think xanto's in is a good way to start here. It's as you said, it's a really difficult game as well to predict because and house and has a lot to lose and yeah, we spoke about quiles more or less out of the talk about promotion. So yeah, but I think he will wants to find a way to end this good season in all right way and yeah, that's why I go with Keel although than 2,000 will make a tough game out of it that they will indeed. The second of our group through games is in magdeburg. They'll host grow. Its of furth massive game for magdeburg with the inform Ingolstadt. At their heels. This is only the second meeting between the two sides that when they did play invert. It was a 3-2 win for the host plenty to play for Eve of course foot can get themselves out of the direct relegation line of fire with a points. How do you see this one playing out? Yeah, exactly like that. I can't really pick a winner here. Although like just on paper. It would be crucial for Mark to book to win with seen all the fixtures around them. But yeah food as we said before for definitely improved untouched under Stephen lighter and it's going to be a tough one for Marta book to win. They yeah, they're in a crucial situation and go with the drool Elliott's would you agree or do you see an outcome in this fixture? I can see first making it a lot of thought they're quite unlucky not to get all three points again only on the weekend magdeburg have been a fairly uninspiring side. So, yep, that's my prediction. They haven't our last game of matchday 31 last but not least is an hour. They ha spoken when the two sides met last time out was 2-1 win for balcombe. This is the 19th meeting between the two sides in the previous 18. Come have 110 and in fact that unbeaten in their last eight, so I put a of optimism then Elliot that that baucom can get the job done. Yeah, but bottom famously let them down. Yeah, I don't make winning the draw things looking good for for ourselves. But still the club has a minor injury Christ. It's a good eight thirteen players missing out for injury, which is quite good because the youngsters have been getting a chance and I've been playing well, but yeah, let's let's go for the stats and predictor bottom. Trade but a side benefit. I mean it's a bit of a nothing much a guy can unfortunately two teams who are safe just playing for pride really but it will be good to see as kick on and finish a bit higher than night sure for sure Eva do share the same optimism for baucom win, or do you see something different? Well, it's really really difficult. I would love to bring some joy to all the Balkan fans out there and say they're going to win bird. I talked to more words earlier and he said that we broke so many roles this season. I'm sure this will be one of them, but what we might hope for is plenty of Gold's because this game has an average of three goals per game, which is not that bad. Yeah. It's really difficult. But I hope for balcombe sake it's going to be a win. Why don't you wait and see on that that concludes our preview of match day 31, we have to topic questions for the program today, but there were two pretty similarly. It has to be said it is all about the promotion. So we had one question from still Penguin at still penguin 3 and another from been Jack. 1871 that one is from Instagram. So they basically go along the lines of you know can paderborn catch up to homburg. And is there a chance that potentially partner born and hide in time and will include all neon despite the form could they displace harsh fell out of the playoff the top three entirely so either I'm going to start with you. I couldn't could they could could Hamburg really be displaced. Well, maybe not completely. But if they continue to play that poorly they have been the past weeks. I definitely say that paderborn can beat them and can really challenge them for the second place and if it's going to continue like it is in the last couple of weeks. I'd say it will end up way because paderborn just because nobody expected that from them. They were coming up from the Talega last season to be in try to get this season and nobody expected anything of them except staying in the league and it seems like there's something they don't want to do they want to go up there. They like the team that says okay if you all of you don't want to go up and it's expected of you more or less. Us has foul on your own urine for plenty of years already and they just don't have the pressure like the fence a oh, it would be great, but we won't be mad if it doesn't happen and that's different and at a humble again and at on your own because on your own once more more or less bottled their season, and that's why it can happen. But I wouldn't say that Heidenheim will have anything to do with it. Yeah, I'd say degree. I'm hesitant. To say I think more than anything part of born will do it. I think they can do it and I think they will finish second if form persisting it makes this week's game and of course, they will play each other Hamburg and part of born later on in the seas and kind of thing much day 33, so it makes for a really interesting crescendos to the season. I'm not sure how you see it Elliot's do seem to think that part of board are going to do it. They'll finish second and Hamburg will slip out or even further with hostile miss out altogether. Yeah. No, I agree. I think probably really could make it here. I mean when it comes down to it, they think for when it matters for and up the last five playing good football. They're playing bielefeld. So easy three points and coming as well. See ya. It could have bugs sit down to third with them. I'd probably ask no. Yep. I would like to see Hamburg to talk god. Great, right interesting game for the neutral but no credit right to do partner born have come up and exceeded all expectations really quite like whole shankill two years back, but I would back them to go one better than Keel and the approach is really and you just said they deserve it the way they're playing nice attractive expensive football. Exactly one for the eye test. That is for certain that concludes our program we Thank you for joining us on on a lovely evening here in Adelaide or wherever you're listening to it around the world will be back next week. Of course looking back at all the action from Match Day 31 and looking ahead at Match Day 32 from myself Matthew Carriage Eva and Elliott's we hope you enjoy your weekend of swatter Bundesliga football and we'll see you next time. the fastest back home I do not multitasking getting and our staff to go.","– It's not every day that a Twitter user posts a photo of himself in a Darth Vader costume, but that's exactly what happened to Elliot Turnbull on Sunday.

Bloody I did not expect to feel the least bit squeamish Readiness and like if I'm being honest, I'm a little grossed out right now. There's often reasons why we don't eat certain foods anymore. You know, it's a small bird without a lot of meat in a very very distinct taste and texture that's not going to appeal to everybody that small bird. the pigeon from gimlet media. This is surprisingly awesome. I'm Adam Davidson this week. We are very excited to be joined by John muallem. He's a colleague of mine at the New York Times magazine. He's known for writing these beautiful SAS stick long-form stories about I guess your big topic is the relationship between animals and human beings. Is that fair John? I think that's her you wrote a beautiful book Wild Ones you've reported for Radiolab This American Life and John when we called you and said, hey we want you to find something that's surprisingly awesome you instantly it was like the answer was just sitting there waiting for us to call. That's what I said Thank God someone is finally gonna let me talk about pigeons pigeons. They are the perfect surprisingly awesome topic. They're all around us all the time and we barely notice them at all except to be annoyed by them. But today we're going to talk about how pigeons are surprisingly. Lee awesome, what do you heard at the very beginning of the show that was us eating a pigeon or a squab as it's called when it's served in fancy restaurants and our guide Sarah Lomond. She's a cook and a historian. She told us today. We are doing a recipe from actually the French restaurant Delmonico's this recipe or this menu item pigeon with green peas is what it was called was on their very first menu, which was published in the 1830s there like the original French restaurant in New York City. To me. Yeah, it's got this particular coloring that I associate with game. I like it. I really like that. You hate it almost wallet. I'm going to swallow it. So how did this bird go from being a dish served at some of the fanciest restaurants to something Americans pretty much never eat to find out we went to where you're much more likely to find a dead pigeon now not on the table, but on a dirty Street Corner we went there to meet a pigeon. Pert named Colin Jarrell Mac. I'm an associate professor of sociology and Environmental Studies at NYU. And as I understand it we're literally standing in the place that changed your life. It did. Colin was a young sociology grad student with a dream. He wanted to be just like his hero Jane Jacobs he wanted to do exactly what she had done sit around the streets of Greenwich Village in New York and just count people watch people see how they interact with the In environment, but he didn't really know where to go and he sort of randomly Came Upon This spot father demos square and although I had been here many times. I was now officially a field worker. I was doing this for a class. I had a camera around my neck, and I had a notepad but it's February right? There's not actually that many people to observe. So what does he do? He starts taking notes on whatever you can find like this concrete slab. It's not even actual statue. It's just a concrete slab in the middle of the park with a dedication to Father Dimo on it Eileen and I said, let me write down the inscription here. And as I leaned in this green white fecal matter, you know didn't land right on my head but glanced off my forehead, you know, and it's like I literally a pigeon pooped on him and just like when that Apple fell on Newton Collins suddenly saw the world for what it was this block that he had chosen. It didn't actually have any people to watch but it did have public three to four hundred pigeons just in this tiny little Park where there was no people Like Jesus that's a lot of pigeons here and in the course of that day and the next day and the day after the only people that really came and lingered were people that came in to feed the pigeons. You know, John, I grew up just a few blocks from father demos square and I spent all of high school working right across the street at the Minetta Lane theater, and I don't remember other than going with you and Colin ever actually walking in on purpose to Father the most Square my whole childhood. It was such a nasty place. And so right at the time that Colin started this project there was this movement to spruce up father demos Square maybe put in some new benches put in a fountain make it a place that people actually want to enter and then I started going to these public comment periods in the community board meetings and everybody was talking about the pigeons. It was really surprising they hated them and so they would say what are we going to do about the pigeons? And what do we do about the homeless people and they talked about pigeons and homeless people In the same way this made Colin realize that pigeons completely influence the feel of a place everyone dealt with them in New York, but never really gave them any serious thought so he decided he was going to Jane Jacobs the crap out of them. He spent years observing the pigeons and father game of square and in other cities around the world, he wrote a book the global pigeon and he discovered that how pigeons were treated right here in New York. Is this kind of flying trash that gets in our way. That is not how we always thought about pigeons and Fact for most of human history, we love them. They were domesticated that we think as long as 5,000 years ago the first bird to be domesticated one of the first five animals to be domesticated and so they were bred as a food source also, of course because they can find their way home from somewhere. They've never been up to a thousand miles away. So they were the first Messengers before, you know, telegraph's what have you so that's what brought them everywhere pigeons delivered the news of the first Olympic Games, you know, the original ones like yeah in ancient Greece. Is Con use them to send messages throughout his Empire since the time of the Pharaohs pigeons had played a role in sending messages, especially when there was a war they were the internet the telegram the telephone of their day. In fact, we know that if we don't tell you the story of one very famous wartime pigeon. We are going to get letters right Cher Ami Cher Ami was a pigeon enlisted in the Army in World War 1. This is like the Rambo of pigeons a lot of people credit this bird with being a hundred ninety four American lives after a unit was separated from its division Behind Enemy Lines Cher Ami brought a message and while I was doing so it was actually shot in the chest when it arrived back at it scoop its leg was dangling off its body and I think this demonstrates the degree to which pigeons were exalted Legend has it that Jeremy's handlers made him a little Peg Leg to replace the leg that was shot off and he was awarded the Croix De Guerre by the French for his service. You can actually see Jeremy's little taxidermied body in the Smithsonian and it wasn't just that one pigeon or that we thought of pigeons as useful. We thought they were beautiful in the late 19th century pigeon fancying breeding and admiring the birds like we do today with the Westminster dog show it became this fashionable upper-class hobby Rich dignified ladies from the Upper East Side would go to the park with their Maids lugging bags of seeds for them just to feed the pigeons and bankers on Wall Street would go out on their lunch break. Brakes and buy seed from vendors just to feed the pigeons and we ate them a lot. They were like chicken is today people in cities kept coops full of pigeons on their roofs. They were small. So if you had to feed a whole family, maybe you'd go up and grab three or four to cook dinner pigeons were so useful. There are some versatile. They were like the Swiss Army knives of birds from Linea humans really loved pigeons Millennia and seriously Adam were a pretty fickle species. I think the list of things that humans have consistently loved for millennia. Not very long. It's like sex fire maybe flowers refreshing summer breezes. Here's our pigeon guy calling again. And actually if you read the Origin of Species, you will notice that the first 70 to 85 pages is all about pigeon breeds. Darwin used pigeons, not only because they were strategic as far as explaining natural selection through artificial selection, but because pigeons were so popular at the time breeding pigeons were so popular and when he first wrote up the book his editor sent it off to some prominent. People and they're like, you know, you should just keep that part about pigeons because everybody loves pigeons and it'll make a great coffee table book. And that was that was the actual suggestion was just scrap the whole Evolution. So up until recently that was our relationship with pigeons everyone including Darwin's editors wanted more of them. So what happened basically technology happened we didn't need pigeons for communication anymore because we invented the telegraph and we figured out how to breed chickens really well, so they produce much more meat faster, so we didn't need to Pigeons anymore either with the rise of industrial agriculture. We didn't really need their poop as fertilizer anymore either. And so that's when the love affair between our two species ended somewhere in the middle of the 20th century. And what happened is kind of what happens at the end of a lot of love affairs you get your needs met some other way and you push the person away and pretty soon. You're like not only do I not need you anymore. Actually now that I think about it, you're kind of gross and like in this case. Anyway, you literally walk around eating garbage making lots of poop. And then it's not just indifference There's an actual pigeon backlash and it happens fast. Colin told us about this episode in the 1960s. We're two New Yorkers died within a week of each other of meningitis. Everyone was desperately trying to pinpoint the cause and a commissioner from the Department of Health use some pretty shaky evidence to say, oh those two people died because of pigeon poop He whipped up a whole lot of pigeon Panic about meningitis, it grows in Pigeon feces. And so he said, I think they got it from being Suppose the pigeon feces and five million, you know over five million people are at risk in all five boroughs and he even give this outrageous quote. Like there's no doubt that people are at threat of dying because other you know, the so that others can have the pleasure of feeding pigeons and in the wake of this a New York City Parks commissioner held a press conference in Bryant Park. His name was Thomas hoving you may have heard of him. He later went on to run the Metropolitan Museum of Art. This guy's basically an embodiment of respectable New York Society. He's a kind of guy. Guy who in the olden days might have been a high-class pigeon fancier, but he gave pigeons a label that to this day. They have been unable to shake he held a press conference in Bryant Park because Bryant Park at the time was kissing to be very derelict in full of deviant people and behaviors when he said explicitly his targets were Winos homosexuals, right and pigeons. Yeah, and so he lumping together and he said the Winos as soon as they're dried out. They make a beeline from Bellevue the homos make Is that people and he said and then there's the pigeons I call them rats with wings if you actually analyze newspaper articles for this phrase. You just see it like spread like wildfire and then of course right Stardust Memories and it's this one seen a pigeon flies into Woody Allen's apartment where he's with his girlfriend and she says, oh, it's beautiful. He says, no, they're not the rats with wings. That's what he Allen's films Stardust Memories from 1980. And from that point on it's codified as common sense. That's what pigeons are rats with wings. This is the point of no return. It's an act of aggression. There's no recovering from its game over. It's like human Carlton Fisk hitting a home run to defeat pigeon Cincinnati Reds in the World Series. The amazing thing to me is that actually people will say it to me as if they invented this idea or thought of like, you know, what I call pigeons. I call them rats with wings and Mike. Really, huh? Wow. I hadn't heard that one before the problem is just because we hate them. It doesn't mean that the pigeons go away. It's too late the pigeons out of the bag and because they're super adaptive Birds. They just keep thriving and spreading they're everywhere now except Antarctica. And remember these birds are not native to America. They're not native to Paris or London. They're from the Middle East and the Mediterranean region. We brought them wherever we went. We bred them to be completely dependent on On us to be used to taking food from us. And now that the love affair is over. They become feral John. I did not actually know what the word feral meant. I just thought I meant like a nasty wild animal, but I learned that it means an animal that lives in the wild but which is descended from domesticated animals. I did not know that I knew that but I mean don't sweat it out. I'm sure there's lots of credit default swap terminology that you know that I don't know. But anyway what it means that pigeons are feral. It means that every pigeon you On the street is actually descended from a pigeon that was once domesticated. So every pigeons great-great-great great-great-great grandmother going all the way back. All those grates was basically a farm animal. So the pigeon over my apartment right now might be descended from some great racer who saved my great-great-great-great grandfather in the Civil War. I feel like there's some newspaper column to be written where someone tracks down the descendant of Cheramie living on the streets destitute New York. I feel like that that might want to pull it to her and the pigeons and they're just like around like wait people. We're just trying to live the life that you set up for us. Of course, we don't see it. That way pigeons don't even have the decency for instance to like live in a tree right because of their their natural inclination for their originally from these Rocky Ledges and cliffs. They spend more of their time mating defecating living and dying on the spaces. We've determined to be only for us literally the sidewalks. They sit on benches there on the cornice of your of your apartment Window. And so It's by virtue of being out of place right? I'm not being with a supposed to be why are these homeless people sleeping on the bench and you might not be able to tell but Collins really angry about this actually he has this righteous indignation that I'm starting to share that we have a responsibility to pigeons and have to say standing there and talking to Colin. We were learning more about pigeons in my respect and affection for those birds. It kept increasing but sort of as a corollary my respective human beings just kept decreasing plunging. Really, I mean it got really dark. Thinking about what kind of creatures are we that we kind of just trembled around the earth dragging all these things with us and then just forgetting about them and letting them fend for themselves and then calling them gross and hating them and resenting them for it. Let's let's help redeem your sense of humanity and to do so we talked to a guy who has not lost that beautiful relationship with pigeons that we all once had coming up after the break. We talked to a man who spends time with pigeons every day a man who has a stack of pigeon magazines next to his Each are a man who built a pigeon coop in his backyard the the red bed.

We're at the part of the show where we need to go inside the Lion's Den into the coop. You just kept so you were home. I just want to explain what just happened because to me it was amazing. You grabbed a flying bird out of the air with your hands. Then you are like checking its wings. You have looking at the ways feeling how it had a body feels. Yeah, how'd it feel good. That's that's a daughter right there out of a bird that one 30,000. This is Steve Rogers. He's a retired pipe welder Born and Raised on Staten Island still living there and his whole life centers around racing pigeons. So I want to set you up with a visual for this next piece of tape. We're entering what basically looks A double-wide garden shed, but a pretty fancy one. It's about a full story tall. It has vinyl siding that matches the main house. There's a lot of people in Manhattan who would kill to live in something this big it's divided into these smaller compartments to keep the babies away from the grown-ups. It's well-lit and surprisingly clean. There's not too much poop. They're considering the first thing you see when you walk in is a wall full of pigeons and you know, like at a carnival when you throw a ring around a bottle and you win a stuffed animal at all. Stuffed animals are just in that giant wall on shelves behind you. That's what the pigeons were like until we show up. Bet and the crazy thing was is that Steve just kind of kept casually chatting with us like birds would whizzed past his head. He literally snatched a couple out of the air as they were just flying around all around us and he just kind of turn it over and be like as you can see on this bird. He was so calm and meanwhile, I was literally like coward behind your big puffy jacket trying to stay low so I didn't get hit in the head by a pigeon. I gotta say however scared. I was I was not as scared as you which made me feel slightly less ashamed. I'm glad to be able to provide that service for you. I Uh, she ate it and you pointed out it's like someone being on one of those game shows where they put a contestant in a glass booth and there's a blower and all this money swirling around them, except. Yeah instead of money. It's pigeons and you don't want to touch them at all. Although to Steve to be fair. Those pigeons are money. It costs a lot to take care of the birds Steve's Coop alone costs about $30,000 to build then there's feeding them really well. He is a very special mix and giving them medicine the pigeons and Steve scoop. Are the same kind of pigeons at Street pigeons same species same genus same genetics, but they're not from the street and you can tell that instantly when you see them. They're just cleaner healthier a street pigeon might live for two years. Steve's birds can live for a decade or more because these birds are specially bred. They're really expensive. These are the freezes over here. These are the mothers and fathers that hand down there. I just I just paid a grand for her 50 actually 50 Steve points out. It's the same as horse racing you get a bird. That's a winner. It's Babies are worth a lot. Even it's grandkids the most expensive racing pigeon in the world sold for three hundred and ten thousand dollars back in 2013. It was named bolt as in Hussein bolt a Chinese businessman bought it a pigeon racing in the US has been on the decline since World War Two there's about half as many people racing pigeons. Now is there were back then but internationally, there's still a lot of money in Pigeon Racing in the Middle East and China, but just because these birds cost a lot of money doesn't mean they're worth anything same as Horses. I mean, you can't you can't you buy a horse for four million dollars. You don't know if they could run for feet because die on you in a friggin stall and how did you get into this? It's a I think it's a friggin birth defect. I swear to God I had them what my I got a friend of mines father had them and he found an old Coupe and up in the woods. We took it apart and brought it into a lot by his house and that's how we started, you know, and I'm still doing it. How old are you 12? Do you do you name them at all? No, I don't want to be friends with him. I got a I got a friend and I didn't erase them. It's helpful to understand how Pigeon Racing actually works. So he's training his pigeons all the time to come back to their Coop The Coop they live in right and then when it's time for a race, he and a bunch of other guys in his region who Also, raise pigeons, they'll load their Birds onto a truck and the truck drives them hundreds of miles away to a place like Cadiz. Oh Ohio or Greenfield Indiana these towns with race stations in them then all at once all the pigeons are like go and they start flying really fast as fast as I can back to their home Coop and this is how it's different from horse racing. They all have the same starting line. But each pigeons Finishing Line is a little different. Each pigeon is racing to its Coop and Like all the pigeon Racers I said the exact distance measured from the racing station to his particular Coop outside his house and each pigeon has a band around its leg that checks it in as it finishes the race. It's all computerized now. It's like a freaking easy pissed. So have you won? Yeah, I do. All right. Yeah, and what do you win money? What do you think? What's the best you've done? I don't want to say all right tens of thousands. Oh, yeah. Are you ahead and pigeons never had a budget? Yeah. You never had. It's like playing cards and you just kind of say even you hope and it was clear when we were in the coop with Steve. It's not like these are his pets. They're just his hobby. They serve a purpose. It's more like they were like cars. He was fixing up or model trains. He likes to build he really did seem attached to them as like living beings and hey parents and animal lovers. You might want to dip the volume just for a few seconds for the next piece of information Steve told us that when a bird From someone else's Cooper Street Pigeon wanders into his Coupe. He just Rings its neck. He doesn't know where those birds have been they could get his bird sick. And what Steve does by the way is just one type of pigeon competition. There's also performance pigeons the same pigeons that bread for a whole other set of skills. There are tumblers which are pigeons that compete based on their ability to do backflips while they're flying there's rollers which are pigeons that are better at forward flip. There's tipplers. These guys are my Everett these are endurance pigeons. So you've got Steve's pigeons, which might raise for eight or nine hours to go from Ohio back to his Coupe in Staten Island, but tipplers can fly nonstop for almost a full day. What? Why do you think you're into it? What do you guys just I just love it. I love to I love to race. I love to I love the action. It's like you say it's like if you're if you really like you want to play cards for money or you want to chase women or whatever you want to do you do and you will and you enjoy it, you know, John it was right about this trip to stop. Island that I really felt my feelings about pigeons changing and when we started this you are already pretty strongly on the pigeon train, right you you were like in pigeons and I started out pretty grossed out by them. I would say I felt solidarity with pigeons and I held them in high esteem and that only got stronger but for me I started seeing them as this Noble thing and I start buying the argument that we human beings show them some responsibility. And so I got in my head how excited I was to go back home. Um see the pigeons are my neighborhood in a whole new way. I got this really specific idea. I went to a pet store. I bought some birdseed because we were told along the way don't feed pigeons bread. That's not good for them. I got a big sack of it. I was going to pick up my son Ash go to the park with him and we'd sit on a bench and just feed the pigeons and watch them people told me if you watch pigeons long enough, you'll realize each one has its own personality. There are funny ones and stupid ones and aggressive ones and really shy. One's a nervous ones a nice ones. I thought oh, it'll be just like in Mary Poppins. We're going to have this glorious pigeon adventure together. top top top And then we talked to a man who told me to cut it out. How do I pronounce your name? Hawk? Laka laka. Yeah. I mean the whole time I was in New York with you guys. I kept saying we have to call Daniel hog Walker naugle, and I think maybe you guys thought I was making him up or something where you sort of patronize me and sort of say his name one way or another way. But this guy this is a real guy Daniel hog Walker naugle, he's sort of the dean. Of urban pigeon science and he is the Dream Crusher for you Adam when it comes to your fantasy of feeding pigeons in the park. He's got a really long history with pigeons and it goes back all the way to when he was in something called The Pigeon service in the Swiss Army where they trained pigeons to send messages just like Cher Ami, you just said that the Swiss Army still had a pigeon service when you were starting out. It was about 15 years ago. They stopped it in the 1980s Daniel hog Walker. Naco was a newly minted PhD in. Biology in Basel Switzerland and the city was experiencing this huge problem a pigeon problem like it a lot of cities there was a core group of elderly folks that were feeding pigeons all the time and not just casually feeding them like at lunch a few crumbs, but in a dedicated routine way, they would have bags and bags of seeds and they'd be tending entire flocks and this really kind of disrupted the entire pigeon ecosystem. This pigeons can recognize a regular feeder recognize the person's face. Blocks away and then the bird will just follow that person to wherever they normally get fed. These people thought they were doing a great thing. But this new food source meant that Boswell's pigeon population was exploding it reached 25,000 Birds. There were so many birds. They were living in slum, like conditions all crowded up getting diseases. Did you solve the pigeon problem of Basel the over population? Of course, it's not quite possible to solve it. Definitely of lip butter. We could cause a reduction of the population for more than half Daniel started trying to explain to people when you feed the pigeons. They have way too much time on their hands because they're barely spending any time looking for food and when pigeons have too much time on their hands you wind up with a lot more pigeons because if you don't control the food source pigeons just keep breathing. They don't have a breeding season. They just do it all the time. Only takes like three or four weeks for a pigeon to go from being a baby to being able to have babies themselves. And this by the way is something we bred into them because we used to love pigeons so much. We wanted them to reproduce as fast as possible and as another aside, you know, how you never see baby pigeons actually until I went into Steve Rogers Coupe. I had never seen a baby pigeon. They're kind of weird looking that's because they grow really quickly. They don't actually leave their nests until they're fully formed. It's yeah, and so if you go into a pigeon coop, you can actually see what looks like an adult pigeon sitting on top of what looks like another adult pigeon. It's messed up and that adult pigeon sitting on that almost an adult pigeon could be male or female moms and dads take turn keeping their babies warm and moms and dads mate for life incredibly heartwarming, I think but not to the city of Basel. They were really worried that these birds could transmit diseases to humans. They were pooping on all the public buildings all the public. Statues and fountains Sedalia launched what he called a pigeon action. It was basically an education campaign to tell everyone please stop feeding the pigeons. You think that you're helping but actually this isn't good for us or for the birds. It was actually kind of cruel. You do not do anything good for a Peyton if you feed them because they they become lazy and our couch potato that you have a less I could health condition. How can a person who works for food? If they are fact every day at the same point they don't fly out and they don't have a good body condition that they have a lot of time for reproduction. That's the problem. It's not good for the birds. We live near a big Park and there's some people who feed the pigeons and my son is four years old and you know, like a four year old kids. He loves running. Through the pigeons and making them fly away and I would discourage him from running into the pigeons. I felt like it wasn't nice but you're actually saying that my son is doing the right thing for the pigeons and the person feeding them is doing the wrong thing all over the world children around through pigeon flocks. And that's good for them that give that's like taking them to the gym. It's gives the measure sighs. So where does that leave us? We spent this whole episode and I'm learning to appreciate pigeons. What do we do with that appreciation? Yeah. That was my question and Daniel hug Walker Naco basically said if you learn to love them let them go you can admire them from a distance, but they are at their best. Now if we let them lead lives as wild as possible what Daniel is arguing is we have to fully break up with pigeons we Get to the point where if we show up at a park and they're there we both just do our own thing now. It's weird about it. There are no hard feelings a respectful break up real mature. Don't throw them a pizza crust. Just let the birds go back to being independent animals. I think it was probably the pigeon scientist Dionne Warwick who explain this best. She said if you see me walking down the street and I start to cry each time.

Hmm, I can't do it John. Mmm-hmm. It's like deeper in the chest. Mmm. That's a ghost. That's a ghost of a pigeon that came back from 1844 to remind us when he was delicious eating poly accents. I do our Israeli. So I just go I'm a pigeon believe me. Don't worry. That's our new show animal sounds with Jon and Adam.","– It's not your usual dish of the week: Radiolab's Adam Davidson went on a trip to New York City and chowed down on a pigeon, which he describes as ""a small bird without a lot of meat in a very very distinct taste and texture that's not going to appeal to everybody that small bird."" He calls it ""a little bloody"" and ""a little grossed out,"" but adds, ""You hate it almost wallet. I'm going to swallow it."" Davidson talks to historian Sarah Lomond, a cook and a historian, about the dish, which was on the first menu at the French restaurant Delmonico in the 1830s. It was served with green peas and ""this menu item pigeon with game"" coloring, she explains. The story goes back to a young sociology professor at NYU named Colin Jarrell Mac, who wanted to be ""just like his hero Jane Jacobs,"" Davidson explains. Jarrell Mac started taking notes on what people were doing in Greenwich Village's Father Demos Square, and the project grew from there. ""It didn't actually have any people to watch but it did have public three to four hundred pigeons just in this tiny little Park where there was no people like Jesus, that's a lot",0.1337579617834395,0.07643312101910828

",10.0567,show_6KLpvCAxrVzbsnBnRs8O4I,2Kg0p7ppcrwKkTsbxYSKCY,"Hey guys is Peter Frey and welcome to the living with hope podcast and Daily Devotional where we dig into God's word and explore what it means to live with. Hope in Jesus. We come today to the second half of Paul's prayer in Ephesians 1 15 through 23 and yesterday's podcast. We explored the first half of this where Paul prays that we would have a greater knowledge of God and a greater. Realization of the hope that is ours in Christ Jesus and here in this second half beginning in verse 19 Paul's going to pray for a greater experience of the power of the Resurrection in the Our Lives as Believers in Jesus. So before we jump into this passage and read these words, I want us to pray together that the spirit would Open the Eyes of our hearts that we would see his truth and be Change by its oh Father lead us as we read your word today. Would you quiet our hearts submits the busyness that might lie ahead of us? And give us the ability to rest in your presence and pray that your spirit would open our eyes that we would have ears to hear and hearts to understand and that we might be changed by the glories of your gospel. We pray in Jesus name. Amen. Ephesians 1. I'm going to start in verse 15 and read this whole prayer if Visions one verses 15 through 3 for this reason because I have heard of your faith in the Lord Jesus and your love toward all the saints. I do not cease to give thanks for you remembering you and my prayers that the god of our Lord Jesus Christ. The father of Glory may give you a spirit of wisdom and of Revelation in the knowledge of him having the eyes of your hearts enlightened that you may know. What is the hope to which he has called you and what are the riches of his glorious inheritance in the the Saints and what is the immeasurable greatness of his power toward us who believe according to the working of his great might that he worked in Christ when he raised him from the dead and seated him at his right hand in the Heavenly places far above all Rule and authority and power and dominion and above every name that is named not only in this age, but also in the one to come and he put all things under his feet and gave Them as head over all things to the church, which is his body the fullness of him who fills all in all. I want you to imagine that a friend of yours gave you a new computer. They said hey, this is a top-of-the-line machine. It's got the fastest processor and the greatest graphics card and you don't even know what those things are. But you're like, this is awesome. And you open the box and you get out the computer and there's no power cord in the Box. You ask your friend about it and say hey, do you know where the power cord is and I said yeah, it's kind of unfortunate. The company didn't make a power cord for this computer. It's got all the features you might need though. And you might say well that's isn't that kind of pointless to have all the features but not have the power that's similar to what Paul says in First Corinthians 15 when he says that unless Christ has risen from the dead. Ed your faith the Christian faith is useless. It's in vain. It's empty unless Christ has risen from the dead you see the power behind the Christian Life the power behind having a knowledge of God and a realization of Hope is the power of the resurrection and that's what Paul prays that we would experience in our lives. He says in verse 19 That you would know this is his prayer that you would know. What is the immeasurable greatness of God's power toward those who believe and then Paul roots that power into things as this passage goes on. It's almost as if Paul breaks out of prayer mode and goes into praise mode, which I think is something that we should develop the discipline in our lives that our prayer life should lead us into Praise of who Jesus is and that's what Paul does at the end of this passage. He grounds the prayer that we would know the power of the Resurrection into realities. Now, the first is that Christ is has the power over the grave. They Christ has risen from the dead and that that's what he says according to the working of his great might when he raised Christ from the dead and then he grounds it in something else. Not only the power of Christ over the dead but the position of Christ over everything you see it says that God seated Christ at his right hand. That's the position of power that Christ is seated at the right hand of God and he has power over everything and not only that but the his name is the name over everything and then we see at the end of this passage and important truth that helps us as we think about our experience of the power of the Resurrection in our lives today. It says that Christ has been given as the head of the church to the body and he has been given to us to be the fullness of him who fills all in all in the other words that Christ is given to the church as a life-giving source for the church. And so as we think about where Jesus is today that he seated at the right hand of God that his name is the name that is above every other name. He is supreme over all and that he has power over the grave. We see the truth that that power isn't simply an abstract reality about the future but it's a present reality for the church that Christ is positioned as the head of the church in order that we might experience his resurrection power in our lives today. And that's what Paul prays for for the church in Ephesus, and I think we should pray for Or in our lives today that we would know the immeasurable greatness of the power of God that he is working. Not just that he worked when he crate raised for Christ from the dead and not just that he will work when he raises us from the dead but that he is working out in the church today you might say so how is the resurrection power at work in our lives? Well, it's it's the power behind the In life, you see hope is useless without the power of God and what the power of God in through the resurrection of Jesus from the dead does is it comes and it vitalizes the Christian Life? It's the power behind our joy. It's the power behind our faithfulness. It's the power behind our love the power of Jesus raising from the dead is the power behind your spiritual life. Life today one resource that has been extremely helpful for me in the past year is a book that I picked up. I think I got it on Amazon or I'm not quite sure where I got it. It is by Douglas McKinley and it is a Book of Prayers called every moment. Holy and it walks through a series of prayers for different moments in. Day, and there's a prayer that I have often started my day with called a ritual for morning coffee. And one of the things that I found this prayer helpful for as I start my day with a cup of coffee is it reminds me that Jesus wants to work out the power of Rhett the resurrection in my life today and it gives some specifics as it prays for Jesus to be at work in us. So I'm going to to end our podcast with this prayer today, but I encourage you to continue to meditate on the Paul's words that we would have a deeper knowledge of God a greater realization of Hope and a greater experience the power of the Resurrection in our lives today. Meet me. Oh Christ in the Stillness of morning Move Me O Spirit to quiet my heart men Me O Father from yesterday's harms from the discords of yesterday. Resurrect my piece from the discouragements of yesterday resurrect My Hope from the weariness of yesterday. Resurrect my strength from the doubts of yesterday. Resurrect my faith. From the wounds of yesterday resurrect my love. Let me enter this new day awake of my need and awake to your grace O Lord. Amen.","– If you've ever wondered what it would be like to live with hope, you're in luck.

Alex fine, bitch, like the crazy thing with that is he was his trainer like he was a trainer that did he hired on to train her. That's what I was going to bring up. Okay. I saw that my God, you think that that's the truth. Listen. She says that they didn't have any type of involvement when she and Diddy were together and listen if that's what she says if that's what she says was. On then shit. I it is what it is. But whoa, May that had to be crushing for did he like this nigga had the born twice. He had two more than twice in less than two miles. Okay, I'll get I'll give him that you had the more than twice but bitch, you know, hold on. What we not going to do is have our hearts bleeding for my Kono. See you misread what I said I said I said he was in morning. I didn't say I feel sorry for his ass. Listen, I did not know because there's a lot of there's a lot of people out there and do feel sorry for him because he posted that picture and she hit the WAP like got you bitch did not today and everybody's Hearts was bleeding like oh, oh, no, he he got every bit of what he deserved because the thing is is I feel like you know did eat to me. He's like, he he's a person who will get involved in a relationship that much I'll give him he'll get him off with a but when it comes to taking that actual factual goddamn leap, he does not do it and and my thing is, you know, I dated nobody and a hot little minute but I feel like and this is always been where my mind is if you and I are dating and we both have openly talked about being married getting married like things like that and that that's the end goal like my nigga if you ain't discuss this It thoroughly with me like said something serious and made some type of serious move towards it like within a year. I think, you know within a year. I think you know if you want to marry somebody but if you ain't hit that proposal in like to it Hey, listen, what are we doing? What are we doing? Because I'm not going to be one of those people that's in a relationship for five seven years and then you're like, oh shit. It's been a goddamn decade. Let me go get me go to Jared's real quick and see. What they pop what they talking about, like what if they do get if they do that because you get a lot of these menu you three five years seven years into a relationship everybody's comfortable and the thing that they gonna hit you with the moment you bring it up why we gotta why we gotta do anything while we gotta change up what we got we good how we are you rushing to hit you why are you rushing stuff? Right this shit? So beautiful, you know, this is beautiful what we got and you you want to fuck it up. Why you why you wanted, you know, bring legal we know on a man with again. So we gonna do because this is because this is this deserves the man out because this how dumb they said, you know, we damn near married already yy-you want to bring the legal stuff into it. We are ready. You know, we've been together for 10 years already. So why why we bitch girl listen, like you say it don't take nothing it own take a whole day to recognize sunshine. I don't How mother I'll care how many people have been together for 15 years. I just knew I knew when she hit that now you're Martin knew she was the one for me bitch. It takes someone no more and a year is generous is very General within yeah, you know within six months whether you want to be with someone or you you can't tolerate them like for Life at that point, I mean because if you're consistently scuse me, if you're consistently around someone you're talking to them consistently, you're seeing them you guys even live together fucking know you fucking absolutely fucking and that that there's there's not too many variations of that that's going to happen from that point forward. So, you know within that six months like you know, why it's not die, you know younger boots Any younger Jagged Edge already? I told your stupid ass. Come on younger. We - Well - well, that's it. So I go ahead. I'm sorry. No. No, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. No, I was just I was just saying I feel like 10 years if Kim was still alive. Oh bitch. He'd still be string Cassie along. Yeah, and you know, and I kind of sometimes I wonder. Her because you know when you think about it, we never saw Kim with anybody after did he like unless she just did shit on the loski like we might become her with any and so I don't know if it was a situation where she just kept her shit hidden or he made her feel guilty about being with somebody or she could have just been so in love that she just didn't really see it for everybody else after him. But either way, I know I'm sorry. Go ahead. No, I keep interrupting you going no. No, no. You're fine. I promise II just I just wonder and then you know, I think that probably forecasting the ultimate slap in the face in that situation what mean, you know, of course, he's gonna mourn Kim because that's the mother of his kids. But you know to have to repeatedly hear him say or read him say this is my soulmate the Des degrade. This is the you know, this was the Queen the one you know, and I'm like, but they have a she was such a queen and You wanted your soulmate one nigga, like what like what boom exactly so did all that shit you talking? It's just shit girl. That's it is just shit. Like I honestly think and he was probably telling Kim like, you know, whoever comes in my life, you know, they're not going to Trump you, you know, you love my life and blah blah blah, but she was probably cool with it because she like I ain't gonna cause no waves, you know, I'm living I'm living good cinema. I'm chilling and I have actually two friends that got together and you know, they were together for years and years and everybody knew of them as a couple and everyone respected them as a couple and mainly because they respected each of them individually and you know, they broke up, you know, unfortunately shit happens whatever so they break up and and dudes they are afraid to approach my homegirl because they like nah, you-you-you so-and-so ex-girl. I can't I can't do that. I can't do that. So essentially that maybe what happened with Diddy and right or why Kim wasn't dating nobody because they probably looking at that like nah, you know, Diddy. I can't I can't I can't come in on Diddy territory and blah blah blah, so he's probably cock-blocking but not On purpose and you know type and you know to one of the things I really can't stand about Diddy liking his is in his, you know relationships from what I've seen is he's the old Shoulda Coulda Woulda ass nigga like, you know, like once it's over and done somebody because okay. So let's take for example with Cassie. He posted a little weak ass picture, you know on his Instagram how much he loved her and then with Kim Porter, you know, she had to pass away for you to openly discuss the fact that you feel she was your soul mate and she was a queen like did you tell her this before she passed away at any point like, you know, like so maybe she was waiting for that but then G even with Jennifer Lopez, he was like because you remember he did the song I Need a Girl and he was like damn. I wish you would have my child, you know, so you right you right ouch, but you but you wouldn't want to Jennifer. Listen Jennifer got the fuck on and she ain't dated a nigga since baby. Listen when she is the queen of when the are you got to get the fuck up on out of there when you can't get shit right with the brothers get you a other goddamn it Jennifer Lopez caste off shirt t-shirt when you can't get shit right with the brothers nigga get you another fuck these niggas like teens planner always reminiscing. What he could and should have did like Diddy you like 50 how the city and did he close to 50? I think so. Yeah, he too fucking basically. He too fucking old to be acting the way he is he acting? Sometimes he his Antics are really reminiscent of somebody like like his son Quincy. Like I can see Quincy Finance doing some stupid shit you to bunch of women. I could totally see him doing it, but that would come that would go a long with his age though. It would make sense for Negative be running around. Look, hold on. Let me put a pin in that and that is a that's a fine. Goddamn young man. I don't normally do the the pretty niggas like I did one, you know you you know that one, but I normally don't do the super super like that pretty but listen that young man would make up. I think we got another stop on the train. Listen, you can be all. The cream and that chocolate scenario. Okay, because baby Quincy Brown listen, I would like that nigga from the top of his motherfucking head down to his toenail bitch. I would give him a whole ass pedicure with my mouth we talked about this. Have you ever licked the guys toes before I have this Peace to amaze me every single question that I feel like oh this gonna be a no-show it listed at this if it's on his body bitch has done been in my mouth before. Yeah. Okay. It's the guy that I did it to he was so he even said what the fuck yo like He's done. Fuck it. Like he was like, I don't even want to say that the shit fell good. Just don't do that. Shit. All right, I freaked me out. I didn't know where you was golf with this. He said I thought you just, you know reverse cowgirl. That's so old. I was reverse cowgirl in and just getting it in and I bent over and he was like, I thought you was trying to give me a better view at ass and he was like I felt like going But you know what I get it I fucking get it. Sometimes you gotta just go with the go where the mood tonight I get caught in the moment way too much bitch ABS getting caught in the moment has had somebody at whole ass in my mouth some feet in my mouth Agape snowball and swapping come with bitches and shit. Listen, you gotta Just go with it. You just gotta go with it. Oh, man, I would you get me off track. They're okay. Sorry, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, but somebody did he know he was talking about the choo-choo train stopping for Quincy to pick a bus and that young man would have me popping some Viagra pills bitch. I need to get my heart. I need my erection to be long and strong for that nigga. Okay, absolutely. Absolutely. And you know, it's crazy because I've heard like I have, you know friends who do like a lot of different stuff like in the industry and stuff and they always talk about how he's so / humble like he's super nice. He would get this nice ass pussy the fuck shit like all you want me to punch your nipples like polite puss. That's just that's what we go. Give them polite puss, but you know what I'm going back to like, you know, like commitment and things like that. So and this definitely goes along with with Diddy and shit. So do you I don't know if I've ever had this discussion with you do you have Like a ring size preference like so when when when let's just say trabant a proposes to us. I mean you bitch so go on that was reflex. I'm sorry girl the wall. So let's just say trabant a is ready to get down on his name. I had to make that rhyme bars because it was thank you, babe. All right, so he gets down on his and he's ready to propose. How disappointed would you be if he got you a ring? That was maybe smaller than what you expected. Like. It was like really like it was a chip ice like very miniscule very like nothing to it or are you one of those people one of those young ladies who like you'll set up like a little Pinterest board so they get some some ideas or some hints on what it is that they need to be getting you when it is time for them to propose. Now this is the thing that finger goes up and that us comes out you sick fuck shit fuck off because I feel like if we're headed towards that direction like we're in this point in our relationship where we're like, you know, what you you might be the motherfucking one. We're gonna go ring shopping and I'm going to show you the type of rings that I like. I'm going to give you my My ring size we're going to try a few on take some pictures of how they looking on my hand and shit. And then from there young sir. You have a blueprint of what I like now. Should you Veer off that course and bring me a chip? You know, I'm not one time in our ring shopping. Did I did I go to chip out and be like, you know, I like this to like no I didn't I didn't I didn't I didn't you. Deviate from the plan. I showed you what I like I'm simple. I'm very simple as it is. So if you can't afford the ring it's not time to propose and I know I'm going to get a lot of the pygmies girl ain't even about the ring. It ain't it's not grunts. Are you to you good day good take a nap with your bullshit brain and you'll obey it is so I'll turn your finger green. Don't take a nap. Go go go somewhere with your tattoo. Bringing okay girl, it's not is definitely not all about the ring. You're absolutely right pygmies, but I feel like If you act like I don't wear jewelry as it is and this is something that I am to wear every single day for the rest of my life can it please be something that I like right at the very fucking minimum that I like and the thing is guys always feel as though like when you say that you want a nice ring. They start you know, that guys don't ever have like a happy medium like that bitch ass or say, you know, I can only afford to do know they gotta be bitches. Only I can only do five hundred but nah, nah, you gotta have that $200,000 ring bitch. It's a whole bunch of numbers in between 500 and 200,000 nigga follow on a more suitable workers 500 ain't it? If you gotta go on QVC and make them payment you could do that to listen just make sure to shit is real because I got it. I got a little sensitivity and I can't do it. I always it's always interesting watching the discussions like for somebody who if a woman, you know is not into jewelry like that like they're just like yeah, it doesn't matter to me like, you know, you can get me a little band and I'll be cool. I'm not super into jewelry either but much like you I feel like if I got a type every day and look down at that motherfucker or I'm holding one of your uh glass kids or you know, I'm reaching for something at the grocery store retching. Come on Rich if I'm right. Grocery store, I want to be able to look at my hand and be like God damn that nigga getting some pussy to look at my baby. Look at in some Supreme pristine pussy tonight because he did good that's what what I propose to I want to be able to after I get over the well if I ever get proposed to because yeah, it's Dixie's and bitch. It is Dixie's and fuck these niggas. But if I were to get proposed to I want to have the kind of ring that once I get over the shock and the all All you know in the fact that you even asked in the first place. I want to be sitting in your lap with no panties on doing what I do baby. You did good. You did good. I'm swallowing the night Sir you live in my mouth as well, sir. I'm juggling them shit you did. Well you did with Anna making you breakfast in the morning. What absolute this throat knows no bounds if the ring is nice it knows. No bound. That's that should go on a 2019 platter this situation set up with some of the silly shit to say on this motherfucker. Hey, but I honestly don't like it's a reminder as a constant reminder of I I have some I have a token of my man's love he knows me enough to know that this is something that I would have liked and loved and he picked it out for me exactly. You know this this it would make me think about him in a good way. And you know, you didn't you didn't get something just to get something to shut me up. Yeah. I proposed to you you wanted a proposal and I propose. Hey. If that's what you got to do just to propose it somebody then go ahead and put it off. Yeah, just just just go ahead and just let me be near let's just continue to Netflix and chill within this two years because at that two year mark Bitch, you got to fucking go because listen, I'm not finna sit up and leave a man if he don't proposing to you I listen, this is the thing. This is this is let me tell you let me explain let me explain my thing is this is II II don't I don't do long relationships like it. Well I'ma say at this stage in my life because obviously I'm not married so I can't say you know, what should I got to ring bitch, you know, so I held out right but at this stage in my life bitch, I'm gonna be 40 next year. I ain't got time to play with you niggas. I am not trying to play you show me that you have interest. You Court me the way. I need to be courted you treat me show me that I have a reason to draw. Up a little bit my alpha female ISM and let you leave let you be that nigga. Oh, yes. Okay. Okay. Okay. So so show me that you it's you know how to not only Port me the way I want to be courted that you know how to help me let the fences down so that I can trust you enough to lead us into wherever it is that we're going and then I need to also know that you're listening that your understanding my likes and dislikes that those things matter to you. And then you need to be making a solid decision to me. It doesn't take five years to do that shit and and no Shades. It doesn't know shade to anybody that's interested in their 3 year 4 year 5 year mark, I'm it because a couple years ago being in a three year four year five year mark wouldn't have been a big deal. Like one of my longest relationship was a little bit over three years. So I okay I get it but at 38 fit to be 39 and six It's gonna be 40 in a year and a half. I'm not fit to play with you. You either know what we fitting to do and know how we finna get down. You know, if I'm the type of woman that you want to be committed to it doesn't take you five years to figure that shit out, but we're not finna do no common law booked it like you can suck my dick or Earnest you can stop the darkness back y'all this is bad. It is back from Zach season. Relationship was seven years and but I was about to say that was also when a bitch was like early 20s like together pretty much. So right we talked about marriage and I thought that that was going to be the person that I married eventually it wasn't nowhere on the table in my 20s at that time. Even when I was thinking back like no, I know that Want to get married but you know, we're not going to get married until our 30s like we ain't ready for that shit right now, right? It's like it's a different mindset if you guys are younger and you've been together for some years that's fine. You need time to grow and come into yourself as a young adult and you know, even a an adult-adult. All right, but when you are, you know seasoned as fuck like we are we know what the fuck we want out of our partner and out of our helpmate exactly. I don't I don't need A 10 years to sit and stew to decide whether or not I want to spend the rest of my life with you. I know what I want right now today. If I see a motherfucker that has those qualities. Let's go right what we what we waiting on. What's what's what's the problem. What's the house up? Like we we fucking know like you getting fed. We have amazing time together like good conversation good dates, you know the sex is great. Like what what what what's what's going on? What we doing like items really on some live now shit like Gia. I honestly I've been on this for years, but for real for real like as I've been getting older over the past few years, like I've seen I've seen just it's either been too many close calls or people that I love slip away out of through my fingers and it's like we what what the fuck Gov are people waiting for oh, imma do it tomorrow. I'm gonna do it. I'm gonna start tomorrow. Okay, what if you don't get that chance tomorrow be like, why don't I give me my roses nail that give me my ring now bitch to fuck like what give him up now? What are let me pass away with it on my finger already there lies a bitch who did wait, that's a bowl. Go ahead pause that write it down. I need you to send that to my mom. That's it. Well, well, let me ask you this because of course, we're the same age. And of course we have like friends who are the same age or slight maybe slightly younger and maybe slightly older. What do you think about women who are kind of just you know feeling like they missed like the love train a little bit and what you mean, they're just like well because like dating is hard like it's not easy like both Both of us have been on dating apps. I got to the point where I've I got so frustrated with being on the apps and dealing with some of the things that I was dealing with that. I just I disable my accounts. I'm like, I'm done. Like I can't it's it was it was getting to the point where it was it was making me sad because I'm like wow because you know, so women are now there are a lot of women who are our age and maybe slightly older and then slightly younger who were just kind of saying, you know, what at this point if Of happens. It happens. I'm just going to focus on my career and stay at our focus on whatever it is, and I'm trying to my purpose whatever but what did you think about the women who are now kind of Taken fat and creating a family into their own hands like instead of saying I'm gonna want to be married or I want at least have like, you know a significant other like it's women who were going out here. Now who are just saying, you know what I ain't got no nigga. Imma find me a donor. I'm going to do x y z and I'm going to go ahead and I'm gonna start my own family. Like, could you see yourself? Like if you don't see yourself in a relationship say for example within the next 2-3 years, but you decide that you are ready to have kids. Are you just going to completely hold off on having kids because you're not in a relationship or it could do you see yourself possibly either adopting or getting a donor. That is a good fucking question good question. So that's what question Savannah guess. I feel like In two or three years because I've already started prepping my mom like a you know, you might you might want to get comfortable with the idea of a puppy grandson because maybe I don't see any any prospects in the near future, but honestly, I am like the Eternal like Die Hard Road. Antic, I am forever a fan of he's out there ladies. He's out there y'all and I feel like even though you know, we've been unlucky in love thus far. I feel like it's going to happen. I feeling I fear I feel it in my ball. We just don't put ourselves out there enough like for real for real you put yourself out there on them on the dating, but you wasn't for real for real you was playing with them young men, but I was he the one time I didn't play and no time out we go, but the one goddamn time. A bit that was enough to make a bid to delete the out after that situation. And that's one time I step here I go. I got fucked over so I'm in it. I'm done. That's bitch, you know what that was fair enough, but I feel like even with every bad situation that we've gone through is just kind of okay that's showing us. What we don't want even more like right kind of prepping us for the future so we can identify it. I guess better of or identify the qualities better in someone better suited for us. But back to your question. I'm sorry beard off a little bit. I don't know if I would depending on how hard the the baby fever hits me because bitch I had a moment today where I had to literally This Woman's office because my eyes welled up with tears because one of the one of the folks that work in one of our buildings, he bought his newborn son and he's three months old the cutest thing ever, but he just he had to loan as crocodile tears dropped down from his eyes and he started silently crying but it wasn't like an irritating whale of a cry. It was just like bitch. I've had the hardest morning ever. I just need a hug type cry and he looked at me and bitch. I lost my shit and I walked out of their office and I walked in mind and I closed my door and I said, oh no, this is this can't end it didn't help that. I it didn't help that I said and I tagged you exactly I you talk to you and baby pictures and shit up in this question. Will you mother fucker? Stop guys are definitely sentence. Body son up to be trapped. I got the time nor the energy leave me alone. You included shit but back to the question. I don't know if I'd adopt her anything depends on how how how cold that baby fever hits me in a few years. I might you know, I might consider the other options, but, you know a bitch like to travel and vacation and Shop. I don't know if I'm if I'm willing to Invest all that money in the other options if it doesn't happen naturally for me, then I'll probably just be like, okay. Well, it ain't in the cards and just showing you and you're with me. Okay, and you would honestly be okay with that like you well then I don't think I don't think I would settle for that. That that would be like, I don't know. I don't know if I'd have another Choice. Well, there's always another choice, but I think I would have to settle for that decision and you know, make peace with it over, you know time. Right right because I don't think I'd be completely okay with that, but I would have to make myself be okay with that. What about you? Listen? I know. This is this is the thing. It seems like every time we you know fall onto the deck of a new year, I start thinking like goddamn I'ma be whatever age this year, you know, but it I think it hit me a little harder because I'm for real gonna be in my forties Netgear. Like it ain't no it ain't no I'm turning 37 next year old just turning 38 And that next chapter I'm finna be Forte 14. Okay, and so, you know being a woman, you know of of an age, you know, I'm 38. I just I haven't had a lot of consistency in my life like with in terms of you know, when I went to college I wasn't, you know, I wasn't able to really decide most definitely what I wanted to major in career-wise. I changed my mind every other day like about what it is that I want to do. I change my mind all the time about, you know, like certain things that I want in a partner versus things that I'm Love to just kind of say hey, that's not that big of a deal. I changed my mind on so many things but the one thing that I've been consistent about in my life is being a mom and you know, I I'm like you like I definitely I believe in love but I am getting to the point where I'm kind of like These niggas were the ancient like oh y'all really not changing yo-yo. She also consulted liege. Yeah. So we y'all consistently the same type of niggas like every year like no change. No nothing. So I feel like I don't think that it's fair to me as a person who wants to be a mom that I sit back and I just wait for a nigger to come along. So my thing is is yes now I've never You know, and I know this is going to say I'm bad and if you are a person who is adopted like I don't mean this offensively at all. I've always wanted to just have my own child because I wanted to be able to look at that child and maybe see hints of me and you know see things like be able to look at them like goddamn little bitch. You took my whole fuckin like the whole damn thing. Look at you and you look down below like your mom a bitch. Hey, yeah, so I just I've never Wonder really does so up for me. Yeah, I could absolutely positively see myself saying you know what?

We had lots of changes to Sodexo this semester. You'll be happy to hear that everything that sucked last year sucks even more this year everything that used to work is now useless. Hey Tara you remember when we could get free food whenever you wanted. No. Yeah.

In 1969 a time capsule was placed deep in the foundation of the Mark Evans Observatory by Apollo 8 astronauts Frank Borman. And now for the question, you've all been asking yourselves. What is in that time capsule that everyone was so excited to dig up, you know about there's a letter in it that says something super cliche like whoever is reading this 50 years from now. I hope I will is this proud and prestigious of an institution then as it is now, you know some goofy sentimental ship. Okay, cool, but hear me out what if this very capsule on our campus holds the confidential files that prove beyond a shadow of a doubt that the moon landing was faked boom baby some notes and words of wisdom from old faculty members will be in there too. You know that me a nice touch. I'm telling you the whole thing was staged by NASA. There's no way we had the technology in the good old summer of 69 to throw a dude up there and who would suspect I was the Eating place. No one that's who yeah, like old-school relics, you know, I'd be pretty cool. I bet they'd be put up on display in the library and you know what else I bet there's proof. It was just a big movie production to get the country excited. We are right in the middle of the Cold War people. There's the potential for an atomic Holocaust and if we're up there chilling on the moon with a can of beer and a lawn chair before the Russians, it'll make us look super cool and take the Public's mind off the crazy world that we live pictures of old students, you know. Theatre Productions Club pictures and school events God. I wonder what people dress like back then Neil Armstrong.

Do you remember that one time when we lived in that big room together and we all shared the same mattress and someone was taking a nap do you or do you know where I'm going? Oh my God. Yeah, I do know and like, okay. So one of our roommates she was like we had this bed and they're like seven of us. We all share it. It was like a twin size to like just like a normal bed and one of our roommates was taking a nap at like 2:00 p.m. And there was like a hot dog on the ground and it was so happy buddy, like half-eaten and our roommate like You like rolled over and she like touch the hot dog in her sleep and she thought it was just a random guys like dick. It was crazy. You had to be there. I think I did. Yeah. Oh my gosh, and then there's that one time. Do you remember like when we went mattress surfing and we like turn off all the lights and we like blaring music. Okay. I think that's all the time we have for you guys today. Thanks for having us on someone. Let me out of here. We are already in the middle of a semester at Illinois Wesleyan. So we thought it would be a cool idea to have someone come on from every class for a little round table chat. So let's all introduce ourselves. All right. Hi. My name is Paige McLaughlin. I am a freshman this year at Illinois Wesleyan. I'm a creative writing major and a theater design production film studies minor and I'm involved in way too many things already right for the Argos. I do the podcast here. I I worked also just for theater stuff in general. I'm in tributaries some in the ASL Club. I probably need to stop myself. Hi, I'm Daniel Mays. I'm a sophomore. I'm an econ and Spanish double pre-law and on campus. I am the social chair for Tau Kappa Epsilon. So all those registered events that I see you all at that's me. I'm also the vice president of The Interpreter to counsel. And the director of the fraternity sorority Pro game board. So all those homecoming events were also one of our programs with help a cab. And then I'm also one of the co 3 try presidents of model un I don't know. It's a little sketchy. I'm I'm Calvin holiday. I'm a junior marketing major psych minor kind of don't do anything. I'm just kind of here now. I have play intramural soccer. And you know, I'm on the phone. guest I'm a terrible person as you guys already know I'm a senior and I'm an environmental studies and economics double major. If you ever see me busting people on campus. I'm the lead RCA over at the office of residential life. I'm also the president of the Peace Garden and an exact number for econ society. And I also Host this podcast. So how's the semester going fucking shitty? We really watching I mean, I was only 25% of joke and 75% reality. But yeah now it's been pretty Rocky Roads. Why is it your classes or is it like everything else that you could you do a lot do a lot to yeah, just like overwhelming but like it's good because like every every Rocky Road turns into a nice paid one eventually. So I've never heard that I just made it up definitely cold optimism. Running low. Let's not go back there. I don't know which ones worse freedom I have to do. What I want now is kind of overwhelming. And also I'm taking four classes a semester that are like writing intensive. So I've always got a paper right because I'm taking three sophomore level angles classes and my Gateway class. So like And I'm writing for tributaries this week. So I've got so much riding to do it's insane. Like there's papers scattered all around my room and on my desk. I'm just a mess his freshman year or I guess I'm sorry. I shouldn't even say that people are going to yell at me God you're so you're so insensitive. I know you can debunk this myth for me or prove. It true is the term freshman condescending. I don't think so, but I'm probably also not the best person to ask because I don't get offended by that Stuffies. I'm just kind I'm just kind of cell phones like yes, I'm a freshman moving on like the first year freshman. Call me. Whatever you want the first year freshman freshman first year your fresh man fresh. Whatever. I feel like I think I know what I'm doing and then junior year you actually like know what to expect sophomore. I came back in like, oh my God, I'm so ready for this junior year. I you know, I came back and I hope I'm actually ready for it. Now fingers crossed semesters actually going. Well. It's basically a miracle aside from class. What do you what do you spend your time doing on the weekends? Because I feel like everyone here like talks about like, oh everything is just overwhelming and I'm stressed doing all the things that I'm doing and then it's just like I have all this homework. And I don't know what do you do to be a person? Please don't forget what to be people know because I'm thinking this weekend. I literally from Friday night when I got home. Sorry Friday night to like Saturday night. No, that's not it. Is that Sunday night? I left my room once in all that time. Because I was just like studying for my be law test because you know, I was very unprepared as one is but yeah, I was just studying and you know, I took a break every sooner than I should but yeah. No, it was just I didn't do anything this weekend. I'm actually so proud of you right now. It's a minor miracle. Yeah. It's like from the out so from Saturday morning, I think it was until like Sunday at ten am so I had been out and I Out from like 10 a.m. On Saturday until about 4:00 in the morning that night and like it. Yeah, homecoming weekend was insane always has and always has to do a bunch of programming for Teague, right? Yeah. It was great trying to make sure alumni don't destroy my house the alumni were so bad this weekend. Yeah, they really were I don't know actually T first time in a long time. We had no damages so I know I think we're at the one of the only Return to these I know one paternity has gone through 89 beds. Somehow question. Don't ask me whether do it then the last so last time I was at Teague and there were a long night there. They were like throwing glass bottles out of the windows on the second floor. No comment as risk manager that never happened. And the professional anything to happen there? No cops. Yeah. No. It was fun. I'm right there with you Kara 4 a.m. Sunday morning. Don't know what I was doing. Yeah, it was all those nice. Yeah. Did you real part of King Charles last week? I'm not if you were theater. I was not in King Charles. I worked on the set for King Charles, but I did I did go see it on Saturday, I believe and it was I really enjoyed it and it was nice to see something. I helped make them together because I've actually worked in theater for three years so like doing this makes me excited. So I'm just really happy. It went. Well. You're not Dead 2 yet. No, not yet II did I have become exponentially more jaded though. That's a result of theater. Like I've been corrupted forever. All right, so we did talk a bit about majors and actually might sorry my econ Professor will say major like major and it It screws me up every single time and I always think you say about measures anyway, why did you guys pick your Majors? All right, I'll start so I'm econ in Spanish and I always say I meet on in Spanish and I'm like, that's not a few I am but I'm studying econ in Spanish. I chose them. I don't know why I like Spanish in high school and then econ kind of stuck for a while. I don't know what you started out as though right? No, I started out as international business and then I drop that and change it to international studies and econ and then a minor in Spanish then dropped international studies and change it to econ and Spanish and then minor in Environmental Studies and that's kind of what stuck so far. But yeah, anyone else have a crazy pattern of Majors or is it just seemed like my indecisive you know, why? Or just like I like to say that I'm setting myself up for the best. I'm setting myself up for failure to put myself in the best spot in case like I do feel like I'll have these things, you know, what's your definition of failure versus success then like if I was like after like I guess two years with two and a half years from now when I graduate like I'm in a position where I feel like I have a lot of doors, you know, so like if I were to You like when you're stumbling out the door, you know, like I'm like hopefully land and one something will catch me. There's a bunch of kiddie pools. I hope yeah, right the safety net. That was 18 at after safety. Net. Do you like anything about like economics in Spanish then? Oh, yeah. Well, I think it's super cool like language is super interesting to me and like I'm going to Spain next semester. So being able to communicate to someone in their native language will be really cool, right? You know, because yeah, I've always always upset that my parents never because my mom's will be Italian when I grew up and she never my grandma and her never taught it to me. So I was like come on but now it's my chance like solidify what I know and hopefully learn a little bit and I feel like econ helps you see the world work in a different way, which is interesting. So I know you're also an econ major terrorist. So I am oh my God, so I actually came in to Wesleyan undecided because I was very He very decided on the fact that like I did not know what I wanted to do at all. So I came in and like my advisor was like bucket take these classes and I was like, alright Professor soltan, you know me you who we met for 20 minutes and I'm sure you know how to determine my life path. Yeah. It was perfect. I ended up in like calculus. Yeah. I ended up in calculus and environment Society calculus actually almost made me a math major because yeah, yeah because my head Professor scheele Lou and I really really enjoy But then I got to environment and society and was like, wow, this is really fucked up like damn. All right, there's some real like terrible issues happening right now, but then I was like Terry you're still indecisive. So I took another class my second semester that was called ecology and environmental problems. And that scared the shit out of me promise. Like Climate Change is Gonna kill us all and so I was like, I should be Environmental Studies to see like I love to help people and I love being outdoors and I think this is the best way to like combine those two. And then I got to sophomore year and I was like Environmental Studies isn't isn't going to make me marketable. I was really really worried that like I wasn't going to be able to find a job after I graduated and so I thought about psych for a while and then one of my friends at the time was like no you shouldn't do that and I was like, I guess you're right in econ 100 class with I'm Professor dirtball and the deeper you get into it the more you realize like that's kind that really is how the world works, you know, and I love being able to like do that peek behind the curtain of like well, why did Things flow this way or like people talk about like the market and recessions and like interest rates all the time, but actually like understanding what those mean is like a whole other world and I think like a lot of people think that Environmental Studies and economics like our capitalist system doesn't really mesh with like the like environmental framework that we have right now, but I would love to be able to like work on something like that to really get that going which is very long answered race. Do you know how I decided on coming the Wesleyan how I was very hung over and we were about to visit DePauw the one with the w and Indiana and it was like 7 a.m. And we have to go hop on the bus and I was like, yeah. No, I'm not doing this so from bed. I'm like, yeah, Mom. I'm going to Leslie and I I've decided that I liked Wesleyan so much. I do not want to try anywhere else and then I went back to sleep. Months later, you know here I am. I'm not couple months later, but that's how it's good. Yeah. You know that song up blame it on the I know but in all seriousness, I'm glad I'm here mostly cause the boss sucks and I'm kidding. I like here. I'm glad I'm here good people could place it cast good better podcast. So, Illinois Wesleyan was like the last dead last on my school's to go to really yeah. Yeah my one criteria because I was decided on undecided my one criteria of her school is it had to have one? 10,000 students and and no one figured that this is not like I remember specifically coming on the tour here and hating it because I was like, I am not coming to this school. Why am I and I applied because like they don't require an essay. It's just the common and that's because I had to for other colleges the like, oh my goodness. So I applied and then like there was so for me. It was either California or bust to like if I wasn't going to go to California. I was going to go to school in Illinois and it turns out that other colleges are quite expensive and this school offered me the best financial package and like logistically it made more sense like traveling back and forth. So here I am. I didn't like it for the first couple years and now but I enjoy your know. I was gonna go to Santa Clara but then money yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I almost went to UCLA, but then I knew I could not imagine you would. CLA, oh I can what so what would you get? What advice would you give to yourself a year ago today? So your last year self? What would you tell them avoid tequila avoid Taka? And get your shit together. Do you think you'd listen to yourself? If you said that um harder question not to get your shit together. I would definitely avoid the alcohol because I'm I'm definitely paranoid enough. That would be like if someone from the future came and told me not to drink this. That means some shit went down. So yeah, I'm definitely listen to that part. But like I would definitely not get my shit together like dude, who are you to tell me what to do and I'd like ignore the part where it's me. I'm here is is here with a the first the first year has to say and then fresh but yeah the way man fresh get over that advice. I would give myself a year ago today you're going to day me actually kind of had her shit together and then second semester happened and I became a journalism teacher for four months and everything went downhill from there. So fun fat. Yeah. I'm going to tell that story because that's year ago me that I kind of wish I could have changed so My journalism teacher got for not quite fired, but we'll say it was demoted demoted no longer the journalism teacher at my school and me as the editor of the newspaper and the only one who any clue what the fuck they were doing what they were like you want to step up and teach this class for the last four months of your senior year of high school with no pay and I'm like, okay because I want the paper to work out and because I put a lot of hard work into it and it was a whole thing. And I did the whole senior issue for my class of like 68 by myself, and I'm super proud of that by the way like that. I submit I took a whole day off class just by myself. Like didn't ask anybody. I was just sitting email on my teachers like this is what I'm doing. Send me the homework and they're like great you do you boo, but yeah, I got my first D because I took so much time out of that class failed my first final I was so mortified, but I'm glad I did it and then turns out they got rid of the journalism program this year after all that work I put into it, so I'm not Not salty, but yeah tanked my grade for all that but I'm proud I did it's good portfolio. Good English experience. Got to give an f to someone. I really hated. It was so good. And it was so good. It's like he thought he could half ass and get away with it the mic. No, I'm your teacher. Now you son of a bitch. That's the craziest Power Trip I've ever been in my life. Yeah. Thank you. Yeah. No. You're welcome. All right, mr. Wants to hear what the man fresh has to say your turn. I just want to say that why seniors don't rule the world a year ago today. I would tell myself to go find the econ 102 tutor Terror will see I'm getting that was serious. But like queasy at the same time, I would say check yourself calm down. I don't even know what I was doing a year ago today. Like I was rushing a fraternity which was like I was going to ever do that. But now I don't think I think I would tell myself to like live a little more, you know, just because I was super involved and just like not involved but like super just like I don't even know what I was doing. Yeah, that's my answer just calm down, you know to my present self to and everyone just like relaxed senior Parables like junior year. It was a crazy year for me. It was crazy tough and it was So like my academic year was yeah a really tough time. I had take that was taking a senior Sam. Thanks fun. I had just gotten back from my Freeman Asia internship and I was like readjusting and like everything and I had just started like real training as an RCA. Everything was going crazy all at once and I wish I could have told myself. I kind of burned a bridge that I wish I hadn't and so I probably tell myself not to do that and things aren't quite as insane as I had thought they were I I had recently gone through a really rough breakup and I would have told myself don't get back into that. You stupid son of a bitch and then on the same note though tell myself like you are gonna do really good things like you're going to look back on yourself like so my senior year looks back on my junior yourself and I'm really proud of everything and that I did that year and everything. I was able to kind of like established during that time and that's something that I personally struggle with a lot is not thinking like I A lot of substance as a human being and I would have told myself like this year. You're really going to make that happen. You're gonna like that part of you that you finally get to like reconnect with everything that you care about like you're going to reconnect with it, and it's going to be great and you're going to be fine. Right now, yeah, so what's your biggest concern today? I can talk about that first if you guys want a second to thank you. What is your biggest concern? I don't like to because like to go ahead and ones really dumb and the other is dominant different way. One I really don't want them to mess up the last season of Supernatural right? I'm so sorry, but like no that's so hun Ruess thing everything if they fuck it up. I would be so pissed. I'm sorry the two main characters in Supernatural are super attractive so hot All day every day being I think I own the only reason why I made it watching it so far with simply because all the characters were so sexy. I would very Misha Collins if he came in the store right now, like am I the only one Misha's even? Okay. Okay. Okay. Sorry other kids other more reasonable concern. So I got hit with like a random wave of baby fever like a couple weeks ago. And then I was thinking about like do I want to have a kid in this shitty-ass world? Like do I want to have bring a kid into the world is going to end like 30 years, you know, and I'm just like shit. Yes, it wasn't my concerns is your local is Major. I am also very concerned me is always money. I actually like I looked at my bill today. Like I went to the business office today and put my paycheck and my Builder like oh you have to have this thousand dollars paid by the end of month and I'm like, yeah. I know. I don't need to be reminded. Thank you. Thank you so much for reminding about the poor financial decisions. I'm making with my life instead of going to is you like I should have done right now. I think my biggest Learn is my well-being and the well-being of people around me with regard to mental health because she'll mental health days. I know is it I did not plan that yeah, I just feel like right now like these past like three weeks for like not only myself but everyone around me has just been like so shitty. Um, so my biggest concern is like I have I've no idea what I want to do when I graduate like I like looking around at jobs. It's like there are so many options available that it just shuts you down the second you even want to search for a job and then I start thinking about sitting at a desk all day and I start like feel myself atrophy both like mentally and physically and then I have a bit of a panic attack and then it's just like You have a ton of things to do for senior some girl leave that alone. So we're going to do some lighter stuff to kind of wrap everything up and we have a request for the best. Would you rather on this page? Which is would you rather all your haircuts end up looking like a loaf of bread or every piece of furniture you sit on turns to wet sponges this hurts me because I don't like imagining that like the squish.

Can you imagine like waking up in the morning and you're just damn and pruney so we can look in the mirror at least all the time with my hair was like oh Loaf of bread but like what kind of loaf of bread we're talking like loaf of bread you get in the bags of the story talking like a homemade loaf. We talking like the kind of lobes you get it like restaurants that they like give to the whole table. But you eat all of them. Is it straight or sideways exactly. They're so like loaf of bread like Define loaf of bread here guys. Well now I'm imagining like, you know, those like loaf that you can braid together as like three different things in there all flavored. Yeah, I'd be so like I would just have a braid all the time then, you know, yeah cool braided bread. No, no. No, that's some of us people are getting like a low but what's a normal loaf know what I mean? Do I leave I hope so the grading or be that every time you sit down you literally just like to return this way sponge, but does that mean it's a sponge for everyone else to or do this? Everyone just think you're crazy like the summe sitting on a couch with like three other people like do they also feel the sponge? I'd be angry if my friend came over and turn my couch and doing fun. Oh my Imagine it was like delusional and you were going crazy you just tripping and yours. Macaque normally just I don't have a loaf of bread on the head right now. That's all you have to do your an influencer man. Thank you. Yeah, because MB. How do you seem like like some crazy Street where like how they where just oh have I say crazy? Yeah. It wasn't a hair.

Fifty years later, it's being dug up. The Chicago Tribune reports that a time capsule placed in 1969 by Apollo 8 astronauts Frank Borman and Frank Borman has been unearthed in the foundation of the observatory. The astronauts placed a letter in the time capsule that said, ""I hope I will be this proud and prestigious of an institution then as it is now, you know some goofy sentimental ship."" Wesleyan student Terrell Wilson was one of the astronauts who placed the time capsule in 1969 and has been advocating for it to be dug up for years on the school's podcast, Wesley Stars. Wilson told the Tribune last year that he hoped the time capsule would hold confidential files that prove the moon landing was faked. NASA staged the time capsule for a movie in order to get the country excited for the moon landing, he said. ""If we're up there chilling on the moon with a can of beer and a lawn chair before the Russians, it'll make us look super cool and take the Public's mind off the crazy world that we live pictures of old students,"" he said at the time.",0.06779661016949153,0.05084745762711865

We are I'm saying I want to be in their face because I want to say it to people like I've never it's like so you ever like sometimes for me I could be sitting back and I'll be looking at somebody maybe singing I just feel like I'm pulled to tell them you do not pose a continue to sing this type of music opposed to get on back home down here church. I'm a I'm a So Justin Bieber at you Justin beat you known from in the fact that the fact that she yelled that out when she is known. From the day that that video first came the fuck out. It was just something in me that don't like the something in you and I don't know what it is. And I don't you ever meet him up against just something about him that just grind grind your fucking dick that I liked it. That's a baby baby. Just the song is stop grinding my gears. I don't know if it was his because I'm not saying he can't sing because when he really would he really do try or he's or he singing a slow song to hear that he can sing. It's just it was something about his persona. On his face, like if I had been in school with him. I don't know like every time you to raise his hand out of turned around. Oh my God till we would have eventually fought. I'm sorry. It's just something about you. It's just something about you. Remember it don't be for nothing. It's just some people their energy and then you just don't like him. I just don't like them. I just don't like it. I just don't like them not to say that make the ones around me like, sorry. You have won me over. That was a great song. That's it. That's it. Okay. Yeah, I don't know. I don't know what it is. I'm gonna throw out every be the see Reba McEntire's my baby. Phil about it. She that's a comedian she made those comments in it was a joke and my problem with her was backpedaling the fuck. Am I said that shot us at right in it. I said it you said you said it because I'm trying to figure out what it is y'all are really going to do save for take that TV show and then I would have been on Twitter with that fuck that TV show. Well, I ain't been on that TV show and some odd years y'all come back with all these reboots. Fuck it my money solidified, but it obviously Because they said they'd seen her out there somewhere in California look a mess and she did she looked a mess and she called the cops on somebody was trying to get their own there took had when I was tied with a rope on her something more crazy. She didn't well, that's not that's not from her being poured that's from her being, you know, her mental issues. She's got problems. But the thing is I'm not about kids. Nobody else was a joke. And when I saw when I looked at the lady I felt when she would say, I mean, but I agree we as a people can feel some type of way. But I mean we talked about each other as as any race, we talked about each other at all different times, but certain things that should be said in behind closed doors. Like we don't we I don't know. I can't say I wouldn't be on national TV or tweet about somebody like that. Like I wouldn't just toast shit at trial even though I don't like Trump and some of the things that he do I like some of the things that you do and I don't like some of the things you do. No, I don't think he should be president again, and that's just my band. I think his son looks like The Purge and I must say that in four years time and I want you in this is some real shit in four years time when it go to window. I mean not for years time, but they come up time for him to get in the house again. I guarantee you we great. So so what is that like a how long is that a way to election? And then I guarantee you will discover that he ate. It ain't going to be no vote. He in there Baron if that no Trump just add that kids not of age yet. But if he is not the epitome of the omen mayor and yeah, you should be in that movie. I love that be a remake. That'd be a hell of a remake it as a joke, but I know what I feel in the spirit. He's still there. How would you know what this localized? Who is we that you would be paying that close attention Okay. So what we saying that mean I was touching on something so that that don't do that because then that look like you was where I was right all along but I know I'm right. He said the whole family is reminiscent of The Purge, although specially that one son and just His wife us where she is. She is trapped. Boom. She came. Yeah, she's pretty but she can't get out there she talk much. I don't know she give me Katie Holmes every time I see her. She look like a the old not look her attitude. Okay everything about her just screams free me. Yeah, Katie Holmes did look like that every picture. You just look trashy Tom Cruise. She always look like she just did not see she sell out of place like it, which is I don't know. I really thought her and Jamie Foxx was one last I didn't it wasn't evenly yoked. Okay, I'm gonna throw somebody else. It's not too much. It's not too many people that really grinds my gears. It's not know. I know somebody that's like years Paula Abdul for no reason. It ain't for no fucking reason. It's for a reason for no. Listen. This has been going on since I was like 13. Okay, Brandi But Ruby snapping on my to my only thing is she seemed like she keeps getting away with a lot of stuff like first it was the whole automobile ship and we let that slide but then come to find out that old Bull from what is it immature?

I am if you live in London, you've been seeing it just for UK. Generally. It's kind of been a bit of a shit show. Yeah, it's just been and I would literally wake up this one as a time. So this is that literally how simple I was thinking. I'm just tired or bad things happening and if I know bad things have always constantly happened and it's not it's nothing new like the world has been like this for a long time and it's just a case of it's just more televised now, it's a mall you see it more now, but it's just like constantly there is no No, yeah every day. They're just some bullshit. We've got fucking lodge out as fucking refusing to leave fuck off Teresa because your Right. Yeah, we again did it right for you? And you said no I'm not going they still don't have a government. I don't imagine being that is that your man say, I don't want to do this anymore. Are you moving? So I don't need this anymore is that now but I was now we just go home. It's just sky, but yeah, so where does here maybe with a little bit of rest by and just a little bit of happiness because it's yet it can all seem very I've been very mentally draining absolutely way. These things have been happening. Like there's always been things happening. But now you log onto Twitter and you expect it to be like some light relief, but you've got you know, you follow all the new even if you don't work in the media, you follow these new sites and you see everyone tweeting about it and you're like wow, but why do they bad love about the social media side of it is that you can see everybody that comes together. It's a poor and it's absolutely like heartwarming to see like, you know, Marv, he cited the go go fun. - yeah, just like seeing that being retweeted everyone, you know. Yeah supporting each other. Yeah, by the way, if you want to donate if you're in the UK if it's for the fire everything, so this is for the fire that happened at our block in elaborate Grove, which is really close to where we used to record because the other way and people are going to need support and help and like imagine just losing everything. So if you are looking for somewhere to donate money, there's two places that we've heard of one is if you go to on Twitter at Shams face for music, she has a GoFundMe page and at Marv Abby has a GoFundMe page and also they're tweeting details if you want to like physically go down and help or if you want to donate things like any little thing that we can do. I think it's a game don't know which I can even if it's like the smallest amount that no amount is too it's going to make a difference because I just like to retweet it Cheryl. Yeah. Just get it out there and let's just Let's see how much we can help people and not focus on the shit of the world and just focus and like the goodness the changes that we can make. Yeah, and if you have any ideas of them even show up before tourism a comes if you forget your but, yeah, so I hope you guys are well and doing good and we're here to put a smile on your face by all their shit.

Hi when you've had too much sweets and you need to like poop, but it's just an overview ask but it's not like you're constantly it. Yeah, it just kind of like yeah just random bottle of water is my mom has a random bowl of war in the house and we've got like a big Jesus and I house that we call doing on in yo in Colombia, so she's got it there and there was just like a bottle of water in the kitchen and I was thirsty so I drank it and my mom came down. She was like Molina Where is the water and I was like I just drank it. She was like oh my God. Oh my God is holy water, and she's taking it to them hot hot hot hot My charge dating anymore or one that's the best ones are like a couple of nuts in your mouth. And this year in a bang you need a good nothing. What why you got to take it there God. Guys, I was just talking about like I don't know what it is with me, but I'm literally like even in my friendship group as well. They're just like Molina really how I just said. Hello. How are you? How are you? Turn it sexual? No, it's just me. He's like that. You know what it is. It's because I don't get it, but I'm like that. Yeah three-phase have someone at work that out by perfect. I say sexual things. She was that you do things as if you're trying to turn someone on I was like really she's like, yes you black you go put your lipstick on but you're doing it if someone's watching you doing Yeah, yeah, there's a couple times you've done shit and I'm like, you know, because I've seen you switch I've seen you there is a source. No, that's your source is called guy up. I think I can but I think for me everything's about banter. So it's like I have to make somebody laugh and that's kind of like my flirting way with some as my way of letting somebody. I don't know though. If I've got like actual game again. I don't know what that means. What does it mean to have game? Because I know I can I know it on a guy but I don't know whether I have yeah, I think I do. Okay, does it work? I think is Gamers because I think there's some guys that don't need game and I feel really good looking. Yes, and I think most if not all girls don't need game because I think game to me is that I wasn't even checking for you like that. But now I'm like shit. So I really fancy this guy like, where's this come from and I think for girls we don't A lot of us don't need you. I think it's hard to get a guy that doesn't like you to like you. Yeah, because if there's a way bring me I think girls that quote unquote unconventionally unattractive year. I'm trying to find a nice way of saying clouds basically, but I think it's the same it's the same thing with girls as it is with guys people that are not conventionally good-looking have the best game because you have to you have to do but I don't know. If I'm wrong, but I think I know girls that if a guy moves to her she knows how to keep him interested. Yeah, I like when they first meet. Happy that guy and he was like, wow, I like anybody know what I really got the most out. There is seen across my number. That's yeah, even now even the even just say that you're gonna have to talk. Yeah, when you're talking to a guy of engaging with the glider in like you're having an amazing conversation. He doesn't ask for it. I don't understand. So anyway, yeah. Yeah, what was that like but having said that many times that I've got I've given a guy my number and never replied in the morning like yeah, of course because it's like you're not drunk anymore you're lying. If I have game, I don't know however move toward I've moved to a guy before so, you know my ex-boyfriend the one that recklessly cheated on me. Yeah, he I moved I moved to him my things. He's the kind of gotten this is these are the kind of guys that I love not guys that don't pay you and you mine cause I don't like that even like I need a little bit of Engagement, but guys that just don't do too much like guys that are very mysterious and I remember the first night. I met him. He was like minds of his business chilling in the corner and he was the only guy not in the dance world doing power and doing the most really made me attractive. To him, so I was just smiling hard, but I don't think that's very gamey smiling like them like smiling bear hard and that eventually I went over and I was like obviously works. I ended up with him for five years or five years. I think that is you know, what I do that a lot. I dropped the Latina card in there a little bit. Okay, I like money bouquet in Colombia. I spoke am Latina, you know that works with God. I think that works though. No, but I'll I mean game is there's a let's say there's a guy you like now and your call like whatever but you like him how you how did girls get that guy to like them? Like, I know how guys do it the thing with me. Is that for me to get him to like me? I needn't I'm not going to like a guy that I don't think I've got any chance moves. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So I've got my Mystic eyes of the thing is I because I kind of know where I'm set if I see a guy that I like and I feel like we're still on the same level not being like this is where my reverse body dysmorphia kicks in but I just think specs that he's going to like me or not. I mean, I don't know I suppose when I got doesn't like me. Yeah. Like why is that you like me? But you have a girlfriend. Are you okay, if nothing else makes sense? You have a girlfriend. Yeah on is sounds so wild by get it. Yeah get it. Oh my God. What do you mean? You don't like me? So, you know when you like you said there's only so much you can do to get yourself chirps to kind of thing. You're not the type of girl to actually go and approach somebody. So I saw a guy and he was suited and booted and he looked amazing and I was just in a hoodie jeans and van so I looked like about 12 years old. So he didn't even look twice at me, but he was literally the love of my life. So I was walking past the bus stop when I was like, you know, I'm just going to wait at the bus stop. I don't need to get over there but my car is parked. I don't need the bus, but I went in front of him also. Oh, yeah. I think so many times the two five nine come here. Like I've been waiting here for long and he's he was giving me the answers, but he was just not interested. I really wanted him to I really wanted to show him my Instagram just to show this is what I really look like. Yeah, like this is just a bad day and I'm a hot jalapeno popper for war but don't you find that when you look dead and you get chapter like yeah judge people for that. I wish it was me. What like this I said no questions. No, but I looked at it. I looked when I mean did I mean like when you really rough? Yes, I get some like Hot Doritos from the shop and like some milk or something and then you go back to your house like that on the level. I'm a bit like always the one when I'm in my Jungle Book pajamas because I am no I am so bad that because when I'm back in the ends back in like Essex year, I actually do not not care what I look like when I leave that to the point where literally like if I need to go and get milk or whatever because there's a shop right across the road from my house. I will literally go in my pajama bottoms. Yep. Yes, I'm bugs. No bra no Bronk my headscarf. Just looking sad and my sisters like you need to stop going out looking at that because one day you're going to see someone and one time I went out and I was sitting on the bench and I swear to God someone left a pound on the on the back. You're not coming out with me like that number out. What's wrong with them is that these charges of got fucking cold man? See anyone when I don't care. You're not climbing that I'm like I'm not getting dressed up just to go down the road, you know, I mean, so then when that that day that happens when someone left appendix of the bench, they actually what I was homeless it was so bad - poor person has an iPhone 6 you make me wear but I know use my hand as a makeshift like stand for my tips. No nothing. I feel like I've most like liberated and relax when I'm in those kind of outfit. So yeah. Yeah. Absolutely. I feel like I imagine that no one can see me. I just go out. I just go and do my shit. Yeah. The milk is 150 sweat. Like that, but they obviously love getting that dressed up over things. I like further the getting dressed usually to the actual event. Oh, it's times especially when you go Raven getting ready to go out is almost hey, you know, I love taking that picture and your friend is like, oh my God. Oh my God. Oh my God, and you're like and you're like, I'm bad. I'm site badges getting to the point where like now like, I genuinely have a better time once I've got my money shot. Yeah. It's actually Jenny you feel like the outfit and that makeup isn't wasted. There I will have don't need help. My first time I came up I can imagine that you think like that a hundred. Yeah, I do. So question girls question. Would you ever propose to your man? Absolutely the fuck not wow. Yeah, it said no farms and no never that's not what God is Enough from Consuela. However, however, how not gonna you out of all of this you are not gonna like If it works for you, it works for the thing is Miss a no-face zombie saying what you're doing. Yeah. So like if they say yeah, they they do say like I don't wear that. They are plenty of things can use your feelings for yeah, like a lot of Happiness sadness. Youkai emotional empathy right half and about sympathy personally shouldn't be affecting your life. I just I've never I well to be honest. I don't even know when I'm getting married or engaged. I just can't see someone else doing it to me. But anyways, I couldn't get on my whole knee my heart. I should drop me a hug. Only tiny Thomas be dropping to my knees when I'm and I knew without a doubt it was gonna go there are you know, how I feel about Japanese give her I'm now dropping into my whole one lie to give you a ring that I have spent my three wages. You mean I have engagement ring they do. I don't know how it works in that can be in band and then you've got the you expect him to take initiative who asked you to be their girlfriend who asked you out on dates. I'm very here for Narrative, I like that. So if I'm in a relationship where that has you've asked me to be your girlfriend, you've asked me on a date you've asked me to do all these things. I've always been I've been one boyfriend you to then I say yeah, but there's somebody that's like yeah, but that holding company thing is not normally outsourced. Oh shit. I can't come and I think about how did you do it be something you had spoken? About previously. So what do you think? It's a woman if you know how I feel about it. She's like you're being long. Yeah, and I don't want it to get to a point where I'm just doing it because I'm tired. I want it to be done because you want to do it. Yeah because I can't have what circumstance but I don't know what's on that. I don't think that actually Through her boyfriend a really massive surprise party and it was for his birthday and she actually proposed to him in front of everyone. So not only are you proposing a dent in front of a crowd. Yeah, so he proposed in front of his family her family everything I'm doing so he obviously said yes, but the shock in his face because it was videoed and put on Facebook the shot and you like he was on my man look like she had stuck a finger. His ass because the shock did I ever get married? They're not married. Yeah. Okay cool two years that's going to be I got coming engaged. Yeah, I just think that if a guy hasn't and that's a good yeah, he's not he hasn't arcs so they say he's not ready you are so you're going to wait until he's ready for that matches exactly as a whole time. Yeah, my the day I would rather just be together and just hope that he's going to do it instead of being strung along. Yeah. You have a conversation. They have a relationship. You have a conversation. I'm talking like I know but I'm in an adult relationship. You have a conversation that goes. Oh, I know I do want to get married check. The person actually wants to get married check the kind of time frame the wanna get marriages. I'm an ultimatum. Oh word. I would I what's up guys are like, I don't want to get married, but I guess if that's what you want then I'm all right. We're gonna get ya me your thoughts on marriage. What were your thoughts on cheer? Yeah, like where do you want to live with these discussions on the phone anymore? You know, I mean, I'm pretty well they're going on dates is Cinema mandem. Tell us what you think. What are your thoughts on getting married guy? If you've gotten to the point where you have to propose then you're not on the same page, you know. Yeah. I don't like the idea of it. Like I need to know exactly like you said what your thoughts are my tree. It's also Kill Ya where we go ahead. Well, did you see it and you know, Jeannie miles is that the head - when I get mad one of my kids and I think when they got together initially she doesn't want to have kids and she said she's never felt maternal. She's ever felt and he basically was like to know what I think I can live without it, but they've been married for nearly 10 years now and he now he wants children about that. And so it was just like she doesn't know what to do because she really genuinely cannot see herself being a mama like it's not something that she wants by blah and it's like for them they did talk about it. Yeah, it's changed his mind. So it's one of those things that your mind. But at least hey and you have the conversation at least you know that you've done that. Yeah, absolutely. You know that you were on the same page at least when you got together you had a gauge of their opinion or do you think you could ever be with someone that you loved and he said he didn't want to get married but no really we might it no marriage can last question that goes well just because we're like lamenting on the word marriage so much. What's the importance of marriage to you? Why do you think why do you want to get married? And this is what I asked is well because I think of it in two ways. is sometimes I'm very like, oh, it's just a piece of paper that keeps everyone together and doesn't really keep everyone together really because when you actually get a divorce, it's actually quite expensive and why do I need a piece of paper and our signatures to Define what we have so that's one thought of it, but then the second the other the other part of me thinks it's just a form of like companionship that I can see that you're actually willing to put in the time the effort and Yeah, this is actually really real For You Joe. I mean, yes, I'm caught I'm really in the middle about it. I don't know if I want to get married. If I don't know about the committee's the commitment aspect. I like and we said it before I said it before when I think of myself like I rate myself highly and I always want the best form of everything. So as far as I'm concerned marriage is the Pinnacle of relationship statuses. I don't see why I should sell and just cohabit with someone when there's something higher, you know, it means that there's that aspect to is the commitment I think. That when you're married to somebody yeah people could get divorced yet. It's just a piece of paper. But actually you can't just really really can't just walk away. You know, I mean that once you get that harder though, if he does you're going to fight for it more in fact, you know, I mean when you don't vote one of those when there isn't that commitment aspects of you're not committed in ass in a certain respect it's easier to walk away. Like if you just live with someone you actually don't really have any ties to them you can up and leave when you're married. You can't just go and marry someone else and I am yeah the can't just up and I'm leaving I feel like because you've made that commitment in front of God in front of your friends. You're naturally going to try harder. Yeah, and I think that's what is from because I'm religious you've made this commitment in front of God. Yeah this like this is solidified us. Yeah, like not until after that not until marriage has got actually come and solidify this so he is like stamps this we've done this in front of God. So it's like it's that commitment. It's that it's me you it's God me and you yeah, so it was like a three way to itself to a relationship. So it's a question man. He's going to have both Yeah, this is the way that God designed it to be and there's a reason why he designed it like this. There's things that people saved her marriage. There's things like that. And yeah, I want to do everything goes. Well, I don't want to do it because it's easier to do it my way like an easy just to be like, yeah, I wanna do this and I'm in love and it a dare but it makes more sense to do it God's way because as I've learned you do things your own way you get burnt. Like I said, wait for a greater purpose exactly. They mean Always want to follow What God Says in a situation and he said get married and prosper basically. Yeah. I just want to follow on like United. I want to have I want us to be one. I want to see what everyone did to have that blessing of feel. Like I really that's definitely a guy said no for all of us proposing absolutely. Would you give up to me and know I would yeah, I cannot wait. Yeah. I think it gets to a certain point and you think I need to move on with my life. I need to be as you said I want the best for myself and at the moment if you're waiting around for someone or you're not sure you can feel it's causing you hurt you're crying about it. Yeah, I need to be like look what we're doing here. Yeah, literally I just think that like there's ways in which you can say it so I'm not going to blackmail him and be like well if you don't do it by 2019, I'm gone, but I would be like look this is what I want for my life. And if you're not on the same page, then we really need to start re-evaluating what we're going to do with this. Yeah, exactly. I mean, yeah it is. And all things of client that is on ya know obviously that thing of New York when she was like I want my eggs cracked. I want my name changed. Yeah, there might be an underlying reason why he doesn't want to get married. You need to get to the bottom of that and figure out, you know, whether you can continue with him when I'm not fighting. In this life on the whole like making sure that you're both definitely on the same page. I don't think that you can change you can change him. No because he could change niggers but not that about that. It can change you can change the way they dress it up marriages stuff, but you can definitely change you can change the way they eat here s murmee you can do that, but I don't think very fundamentals and things in them that you can't change but I feel like if you have it in you you can make a guy better. I'm convinced that's like changing You by making I think you change each other now more at stake. I do think you change each other. I don't know. Yeah. Yeah, that's the whole point is poorer than you were five years. All he's done is take from you. I'm actually happy imagine that bending knee and give a speech saying hold darling everybody with my new you know to now We've been together for a while baby another way for you to do it. You know, you're waiting for him to leave. I don't understand it at all is we do you know how many how many situations I've heard of that. I've been like I was with him for 10 12 years. He never proposed and then he's been with this girl for two months. And I don't know how often that happens. Why does that happen? You know, I would go to the I think yeah, I think yeah. Because if that happens. Cookies now he's crazy involve radian because you're exfoliating your form and he's gonna get married when you support them in their careers and they're doing about when you met them working in whatever and they'll be with him. So after not too long after I met my ex broke up, I think I still suck on his Instagram before you blocked me. He took a cab to The Shard so you went to the fucking shit. Like wow, man, does the problem? Yeah nice because that's what I could afford steak drinking wine. Literally. Yeah, exactly. That's my dude with that place what it was like it's a small but it's like a rooftop swimming pool to I said, oh, well was it so her house that's emotional know that you shouldn't make a guy better. I didn't have no. No, I don't want to make you better but I don't make sure that you keep your own as well. I don't know. It's just an L. You have to take that you just have to hold it. There's literally no. There's nothing you can do. So go thinking I'm not gonna make you Baron case you leave it then you're also putting negativity. Yeah. She's holding back how very perceptive It's you don't see you on foot and that's what is sometimes it's just it's just something that you're not lit you does not matter, but it's just that person to live. No, it's hurtful now have to go and crop you out of every picture and my Instagram even quite badly. But what about on this whole thing of weddings? What about someone else proposing to someone now? What does no way there's no way security security. Just the thought of someone asking makes me angry that I like. Are you a fucking mad? Even the sort of the somebody make him better than me on the day must be sick. Are you mad or what? I have stopped for Less. Yeah for Less. Yes, every single Last Detail is expensive the idea that I've saved worked my guts office made all the sacrifices that I can provide all my guests an amazing. What an amazing day. Now you use my burden to become your engage when I use my backdrop my filter, you know what I mean? Miss Monica. Come here. Yeah, well, they don't know what they're in Ivory. I want the fastest way out of whack with a nice white structured not like a photo will be a distant memory. Don't worry fluffy. If you're not a virgin, not only a white dress. Anyway, I'm when like Papa pure white dresses are not nice not nice tackle. It's like but it looks like we never really liked white not I think I was where whites make a statement because they are version. So there's definitely that look we're all in eyebrow. And where was this in Brixton? I wish it was a nice. You trust no bitch. Necklace Wow Wow for someone. Are you? Okay, but still. And I described if P plus 1 so when I'm done, yeah, have you ever ghosted someone though? Yeah, but yeah, Cinema guy goes to them that side as well as you broke him in load. You just goes to him. I just stop just stop. Yeah, Jimmy just stopped and I was still not come back at once a week here. I have some people get the message if you if you go still being a try like she's ever. Yeah if it's a guy with a lot of Pride, they'll be like Russia hasn't acted like one freak like three times. The calling but some guys take that as I'm going to keep on trying to she answers sometimes why annoyed at someone so you're not answering their call, but you expect them to keep trying but sometimes you like I've earned her go to someone it's if I've told them I don't want this to go any further. It's not going to work for me and they're still like a still contacting you then. I feel like I don't know what else to say. Yeah, but I don't like it when someone goes just get it just can't do this ghost in oh, gosh. I just want to A date man. I'm fucking bored. This is so so bored. I just want I just want something to get science board. I think that we're all a bit like singing Because that's the show's over as the show. No, I've been brought before the show, but I've been that excuse us. That's why you need to get onto pornhub.com. I'm not a nerd it secures back. Hopefully it's coming back tonight at 23rd because that's sex scene at the end of season one was getting it like if I was to whack that be my material that that might be was absolutely be my wife. You remembered it. No. No, you need to watch our show you a gif of it. Exactly how you want some he touching somebody's holy life is exactly how you want to be dealt with not that I've liked for by it, you know, like the butterflies you get before that day and you're talking to your girls like oh my God, how dare watch the way I was how many times have I been in the group chat like girls like does this work? Does this not actually right? One that you you price it the intention of yeah. Yeah, you understand that your body in the picture is that they're strapped? Yeah, if you're fully clothed. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I think I've taken their straps on holiday at Sea. I think that's easier. It's easier to do it. Yeah. It's my stomach accepted when you're on holiday because you're not in a bikini like Taylor said in your room is a trap. Well, that's that's that's a child trapped the premium that is I actively encourage it. I like encourage sending it to a man or person do what you want. Whatever way works for you be the thirst trap. You want to see in the world. That is my motto, especially on holiday because it's so much easier, you know, I love seeing women I've had kids and they still have that rub and it's not even if it's not your ass. You're thirst-trapping-- Be widening leg all that bust it open or anything like that. Yeah a first shock is be so like looks so true. You know, that was that little leg then dumped ways. And if a clock it the different artist Josh nice, but trust me. I know I know you're gonna be a reaction. You just posted like a normal person. No. No, I know exactly what I know. Yeah. Yeah. And the thing is I think you can have different types of fish traps for different types of guys. Yeah. I like your books in the back, you know exactly who that sounds like a studio first trap. I'm speaking a bit too much but you know, yeah. So first up because you know, like he's into music. Yeah trainers trainers and checked it. I just use my body. Maybe that's what they like, but I think there's like a standard they're strapped. Yeah, you know, but yeah, I think the ultimate thirst trap like is the what the A selfie where you've twisted and you can see your bum. Yeah, and you're looking back at it. That's you know, what the best rap is as well. You don't post it. You get your friend who has him on social media to post it. What so I've never yeah, so it's like I don't do that dumb shit when you're walking a having a we could mean that's just dumb. Yeah. Yeah not act like you're actively know they're recording. Yeah, but like let them know your ankles. Yeah. Yeah. I thought back to the picture that Lala posted la la la la la he's give him to me. Like white but she was in a bathroom or something. One time when I was going on holiday. Yeah. Well, I've got my own me last year me and my girls did she actively went through Instagram and sort of kind of pictures you wanted to take and say oh, yeah, that's what makes it easy for you to save it like that kind of visual director boy when it comes to taking pictures like it away here, right? Like it's just a normal picture just posed in. Is that a first Rap is what you're showing that is what you're doing immediately make it it depends if a guy that's looking at it like brass. Is it only a fair shop if you're trying to get someone I think yeah, I think you know your head with your intention. Yeah. Add to that so if someone has a stone that's one of my pictures and Elijah. My head is scattered such that they will know you read it. They gotta be like hasn't even though the swiper Instagram is such a blessing but it's also a don't get to the hot one if you post off. Yeah, then you post it. It has probably done. Yeah. I mean, where is you could post one and that again is save it. There are so many holiday pictures that I haven't put up like so many pigs. No I am all here for worthwhile was I was I was going to say I was going to say about thirst-trapping-- Oh, there's a girl that I saw her she time ago and I'm like, I love this number and it all the time to press the picture was I was a very innocent picture she had shorts and she just sitting down there like a gonna buy it was And it shows our Arch maker so beautiful, whatever but yeah called my thighs and I said, yeah love that. She was out here to make us happy flicker Sunset. But yeah, that's my father. Yeah. That's why I hate seeing these pictures of like half-naked girls and they're just like love has no side or just dumped someone about that girls and blows. What are your thoughts guys on her naked? Show your titties once I showed her titties. No, I didn't say about Amber with the Amber Rose picture. I'm here for the British. I'm not going to lie it because I feel like Yeah, I wasn't enough is pressure to always be shaven and all of that. Oh my God, but wait do you feel like now that Amber Rose has got here and a vagina your pressure stopped. No, it hasn't. But yeah, there's one positive thing. I took from that. It was just nice that to see myself airbrushed. At first I thought it was a joke. So I kind of just scroll past it and then when I realized what it was I was I okay, but I wasn't surprised because it's her. Yeah, I mean and I suppose it. She's saying that it was she's doing it under the guise of Of feminism. That's what this that's what how to empower women. I'm still waiting for someone to explain to me the correlation between nudity and feminism. Yes. Anna Lee, I doesn't Kim K do exactly the same thing. But the thing is the thing that annoys me about this whole empowerment thing is like a nudity is that I think that thoughts. Yeah, and now just using that as a mask to decide to use it as their their excuse me. Yeah. Actually they didn't it's got nothing to do with him. Moment they're doing it because they look banging and they want everybody sees that's my thing. I think about it. I think there's like I guess there could be a limit in fun ways and new design because it's not appreciating your body and whatever you want to do with your body and whatever whatever where I call bullshit is when you do things for attention and put under labor feminism. Yeah, that's exactly and that is what I think what I but that's what I thought the picture because it she just posted that picture was a blob of look at this picture. My looks hot. I would rate to me that is feminism. Yeah, because it's you Only feminism me like to me feminism isn't just using the label because you're trying to do something and get with Mary and get away with it and labeling it as feminism feminism is actually doing what the fuck you want to do and owning it and see me when I saw the Muff. I was just like you're posting this because your body looks sick. Otherwise, you wouldn't be coiled up if it was really about feminism you'd have hairy pits. It wouldn't be airbrushed. You wouldn't be covered in baby oil if you're trying to do. Yeah, and it's over sexualized that to me. I I can't help but link it with attention and I think it's a bit of a slap in the face when people do that because feminism for me all that like getting and I'm not saying that if you want to get your like to me feminism means equality Point Blank period And I think that a woman should be able to do whatever the fuck she wants to do quite frankly. However, I just think that we need to be careful with how we're using the the word and I think it's just becoming Loosely used now and that's that's not because all that make it and they could stuff to me that the Bottom of the totem pole when it comes to what's important in terms of women's issues. Yeah. I mean, I'm not saying that there isn't a space for it because I think that there is I think that women being able to be proud of their bodies and own their sexuality is important, but it's not as important as some of the issues that we need to tackle FGM sexual abuse rape domestic violence the paint that the pay Gap all of those things for me come first, so I just can't sit here and come down all of that stuff when there's so many other things we need to tackle. That's mine. I just I don't see how Ow, that picture helped or hindered anything. It just didn't do anything about it. It's like the Kim Kardashian when she broke the internet with the paper magazine cover. There's an x-ray for had to pop. Yeah, but I don't see how it helped or hindered do anything any anything but then at the same tokens I was thinking about it and I was thinking this time to get her money. That's not gonna get anybody but I just thought it was ironic because amberbogie hasn't really been And the plugs much hasn't been on the shade very much. And then so that's why I links of attention as well because she's a bit quiet for her. Well, because that's like when she gets more interviews and she gets publicity. Yeah Club begins at all about. Yeah such a coincidental that you have been a little bit cold on your end. And now you post this picture in your products, but is there like she like wrote on her chest? Like I don't know. Yeah feminist quote something. Yeah, hold up and my issue. Yes, screaming feminism says but you're still doing this for the male gaze. Exactly. Yeah, because if it wasn't about Mel Jake to be sexual patriarchy basically, but then at the same time you're fighting against it and I'm not saying that being naked makes you any less of a feminist because I don't That that's the case. But to me, I just don't understand the correlation. But what I was saying before is that there's different levels of feminism and I think that for Amber Rose like like for me when I think about my issues that I need to do as a woman I'm thinking about the pay I can't even participate gender pay Gap I'm thinking about when I take time off work to go on maternity leave and my going to come back to my job. I'm like, those are the kind of feminist issues. I'm face mask because I'm afraid you on your old that lives in London and I've got a job to go to she's a celebrity that lives on. Hollywood so her what she's fighting for is going to be very different. Yeah, I mean and but that post a picture. What are you fighting for? She's like is what has she gained from it by publicist. He's fighting for his her right to be sexual but that's but nothing against that because the thing is the reason why I also don't agree with that is because okay feminism means equality but men don't walk around in suit jackets and ties with their dicks out. I'm not I mean, so it's men who walk around with their dicks out and women. Able to do it then I would kind of get it but that's not the case man don't walk around with suit jacket together. So what is the equality in there wishing that get it? So I don't get what you're fighting for her life from her slot walk the oh, yeah, that's not walk. Is it just to be like which okay fair enough I get it. I get you know, I understand for her own her slutwalk and to own her nakedness. Some people would do that and literally get persecuted and dragged and their families. I'd be put in danger if they do those type of things. Yeah, because in terms of like only a sexuality as a woman, I am awfully I think that for a very long time woman has been I've said it before I feel that women have made to feel like they can't sex not to be enjoyed is to be endured and they thought their sexuality something that's bad like a girl can be turned on overall National feel like that or like she girl could want to have sex but I'm not I can't I can't voice them. He's because of how Society has made me feel with a woman that I can't own. This is a huge part of me actually. Yeah you too. I can that I can completely No, whatever but I don't like you said this picture hasn't added or taken away from anything. Nothing for the movement. It's yeah, I don't and what have you enjoyed most of it after got the issues every day. She was like, I just realized that my feminist picture bitch. You just realize you're naked picture. I got deleted that's it. And that wasn't because of feminism that was because nudity is not allowed and I think that's fine. I don't see any problem of Instagram having rules like that. It's on health issues because it's a algorithm that does it is a like a robot. Basically. It's not a person that sits in a freak every single thing. So there are issues with some things get deleted. They shouldn't be and who say certain words you get deleted in might be wrong, but I think it's totally okay for these platforms to have controls. You don't want to see the headings. You don't want it's something that they could women or naked men is if feminism means equality than what has a nudity got to do with anything. Not only Amber eyes can't oh, yeah. No. No, I know the link of it because nudity the link is clicked over your body is very liberal. Nobody I but she's definitely the best ways of doing it. That's I've seen it had Natural State. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That's what blows my I am at. The numbers are very dim. If I'm completely body on it. I think I think buried em, she's very dim. She takes she takes the titles tries and use it use it as an excuse and then she thinks shit. I now actually have to learn about this shit. So when I do go and do interviews and I have to speak upon it like and it also is she can she was just known for being she's just because She came on the scene for being a stripper stripper. Yeah and being Kanye and Wiz Khalifa's exit. I think she's taking this feminism thing to give herself a purpose kinds of buffing. I find it a shame that you wouldn't use that platform and all the flat if I had that many followers and if I had such a platform I would like to think that even with us just sitting here doing this. I feel like it's positive. You know, I mean that I would like to think if I had that many followers what I would do to help, you know, what it is with Amber Rose and I think this is might be a fair thing to say is she Have ration feminism is the things that concern her. Yeah. So what concerns has been called a slut not concerned her is not been able to use her body how she sees flee without being called a slut. So she's doing it for the dates that she think is a good place. Yeah, of course, that's not saying we as people we all do that because I could say this man someone could be like, well, there's girls in Africa the game. But yeah, and it's like yes, that's true. Yes. I feel like she is what we all do. We internalize what I was going to read. So we make it what's around us. And yeah an issue we can see so I guess we can give her Her that say you're making it about slut-shaming and that's what I'm struggling because that is an aspect of feminism. Did I mean a lot so I don't want to completely dismiss that because it is it is there. Yeah. I mean, he's still getting about doing things outside of sexual assault and domestic violence and rape and all of that stuff is linked. So I do think there's a place for it, but I'm just being self. I can't relate to it. That's not my struggle. That's not my fight. You're not I mean, that's not what I consider to be in like obviously rape and domestic but of course all of I started at the top but like the slut shaming staff and the the being able to just walk around with your boobs out and your badge out like but nobody can do that. No. Yeah, I don't get it. I think I think the message that she's trying to put across she's just done it in a completely wrong way. I think that that like it would you know what it is. We're talking about it. Yeah, that's it. So yeah. Yeah. Well if it makes people go and Google feminism because Amber Rose said it yeah. So yeah guys, I think she I don't think she's coming from like a bad. Place. She just we just don't understand it. Maybe she for us what do you think that we look at it differently because it's Herbert and because of the theater had to be so for example, obviously, we know that she was a stripper like she's always in the blogs are being linked to this person and that person and she says she hasn't dated all these people like this one made up stuff. But if it was someone like because I remember Alex I was reading about it in Emma Watson when she got a lot of backlash because obviously she's an out-there feminists like she owns the label, but she is ivy-league-educated, you know, I mean, she's middle class. Dwight she's really Slim she is known for like being talented. So do you think that there's a difference between it's different depending on who saying I think so if it was like a feminist campaigner and she did a picture. I like that with like hair everywhere will be that great. Yeah, I know whatever not me but I think he intends it has the exact same picture of a different face and says, it's so old up still thinking I don't think it makes it it depends on who it is though. I think because we know these things about Amber. Oh so we can add them. Onto you can't see it with clear eyes because we know about how we judge her story of Emma. Well, actually I don't see the place for a naked picture on Instagram God. I don't that's just my opinion. I like I've all like like I said it once I'll say it again who doesn't make me come like I'm honestly like there's a lot of things I have my feelings for and she's fired. You know, I should be I should be comfortable being naked and not being shown for it, bro. No one else that really wants to do that so it's like what is the bleeding but the thing is you think because there's a lot of her fight in her what she's fighting for is like taking the shame out of the word slut. Do you think that's ever gonna happen? No people haven't that hey people have their own definition of a glut and if you don't care about it passed it's not positive. Like let's be honest. It's not positive. You don't want to be called a slut. Let's be honest. You don't want to be able to sleep, but you may have made some mean things, but they already meeting and words meant Once meant something but it still now it's a term of endearment to some people, you know, it means a lot to me about original meaning I think you know why that can't happen for the word slot because the words law is it's an insult down by patriarchy. Yeah. It's it's an insult for women. Yeah. Yeah, let you know I mean so as long as men are not taking it back on my let making it in certain way. It doesn't matter. I just have to be the ones to change. Yeah, like it's a word that man. I'm done now by seeing that - maybe it's used by men a lot. Yeah, I was used to for the approval of men we bought and if that means I then to put women down. Yeah, I don't use against other women. Yeah when you said it is to please men. Anyway, if someone you don't care deep down, you don't know the words lot has so many different definition when it's I like jazz. It means a different thing to everybody else. You know, I mean scary Jesse she's a jezebel. Yeah. Why is yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Like Jezebel watch what is cool people see? What Whi yeah, they take with bare chest. She's a whole I think it's like what I think ho is like she's a high like a lie. Anyway, she's a hoe because she fucked your man and somebody else, you know, like Melissa said what's actual benefit of not being a jazz at the moment because nothing was hoping I'm not see that happens. It does it benefit of not joking around, you know, I'm joking. God by not being a jerk. Yeah, that's number one. Number one number one to five. That's it then no and especially depends on what your reputation means to you as well. We talked about all the time. Yeah, that's what mine is that? Yes, I should think. Yeah. I mean it depends what's important to really hmm. Still maybe I shouldn't be a choice. I think it's completely normal to feel like what is the point of not just doing it you're going to get like you're gonna be not judged for it. But you're going to people are going to judge you anyway, so you might as well just go and do it. So this way you have to have your reasoning why yeah. Yes reason why you doing the reason why you don't feel feelings are not facts that you have feelings about things you go and do it. And then it's like did you actually make yourself feel any better Sheriff access denied because you know what, I think my high score winning think it's definitely looks like it because I know a lot of good girls like me being one of them not even trying to not pick myself up by in terms of like you can't ye like you've had in your life like you can't do a background check on me and says it won't come out for yeah true. Like, it's just not coming up. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. They want to go call your Halls what their been about, you know a little bit about you know, they've got to have a background check and you see engagements. Usually every celebrity women. There's so many women that we know they own it like, you know, but yeah, I was about yeah can usually get in rings, but we always equate hoping to not getting married but doesn't it does not true. They need to like for the benefit of that be the Jess. You're praising God. Literally Rings. Why does it matter? Was it at the moment? Me know in terms of like so I think I'll see is like wow like okay make and I guess these girls I have more they have more men around them. I guess I guess that's why they win it without you need every opportunity to be able to have they meet more guys are really hot and they get can get guys. I mean, come on. Did you go leaving your always been? You know, this limit the pickings are wider. That's gonna be someone in your life get guys. This is literally what I was saying, like, what do you do? Do you stay at home be a good girl? Never meet anybody or do you go out and nobody can be out and be a good girl? I am. Yeah, I can definitely be out and be a good girl, but guys that yeah, but you know guys are like, yes, she's at one time and he must have put a promote our take that in. He's a promoter. So he's always in your text is always in your WhatsApp is always in your DMs talk about come here. Come here this night that night so it about last two tickets and he had the cheek to post this picture of a meme of a girl sit in and out how she's wearing shorts in the socks are tired chilling with no makeup on it was Kind of guy he was and then it was a car not a girl that goes out every week ago and I literally commented this picture. I thought you were my are just by the grace of God. I was like you you that is the club you're going to meet your way and then my she had even asked me about what you're going to everybody can do the same things. I write that in his comments in the my friend Rachel. She tagged him then she was like she was like, how do you how are you supposed to meet these girls if they're always in their house? Yes. So we're all in agreement. That is Mason is the thing is with that picture. I just think she looks I think about it looks much like but mad if I could look at Ambrose like body-wise. I don't have a problem with the picture. I just don't like the mask of thought the feminist. Yeah, I think it's just a lame excuses for her to post sexy pictures where I was I think that being real feminism would be just saying look I look bomb in this picture and boom have it. So do you think it's like quote unquote someone who didn't have quote-unquote perfect body. I didn't I Right if I posted that picture whatever you like watch because I have you seen that I've seen a lot of on Twitter recently. I've liked girls that post nepotism in bikini bodies and be like, yeah, this is what my body is. I feel sick feel sick or when I got that. Nice like your mom. I love I wish I had the confidence to do that. Yeah. Yeah. I know what that's I am a very very confident person same and aside from not wanting to have sex because I'm trying to live a be as pure as I can. My body's not there for me. And I tell people I don't like but I look like shit. They killed my mate. I find it's more like that now since I've had a baby because I everyone used to say to me. I had two guys say to me. I never slept with him or anything, but he was like, you can always told baby moms because of her. Stomach the red and I was like, I've got stretch marks. So I've always been like oh my God, if I'm naked like Yahoo! Obviously know I have a child, but it's like, you know, very apparent. Yeah. I have a child because you know the loose skin stretch marks, etc. Etc. But yeah, I've had a few guys say to me like body shamed me because I've had a child like you have a baby. What's good? What's your what you shouldn't wear that or I know just been like yeah, you look better before, you know, I think that guys that bought after having babies are completely stupid and uneducated not to not understand what a woman but it is really sad though, because you know, like you see people that are just like not even people that have had kids people in general that have stretch marks in the like, you know, embrace the tiger stripes like, you know that this is my body that had but if somebody yeah, yeah caught I grew a human being and what not and I did something amazing, but Somebody gave me the money tomorrow to make my stretch marks disappear. I would absolutely do it. Do you think that guys that have a warped and not even just guys at young people as well? I have a warped perception because in my celebrity yes, you know, like literally like celebrity moms. I have a baby and literally a month later. This body is snatched their stomach is fly and that is not reality. I actually really hate so much money for weeks after I gave birth to cataleya to get back to a size 10 12, and you know what? When I actually researched it and I went to the doctors for a checkup. He was like, do you understand what your body's gone through internally for a year? It's been changing and adapting to everything and now you want to go and go and strain yourself for what to please other people weren't really a truly. It was really to please other people. Yeah, I don't feel comfortable even now in my body. So there are some things I wear and I'm just like I don't think anybody that can shame someone like okay I get it like You've just if because there were some people that had they've got a ten-year-old and I'll be like well, I just had a baby, right? Sweet to me like I've always had comments from other people on my body, but I didn't used to look at my body. I didn't used to think any of these things. It just it was just I just walked around like I just live my life like you just was my body with my vehicle. But I've always had even from school like people making comments about me friends saying, oh you should lose some weight. You should put some weight on like always changing their opinion based on like how they felt that moment. And it's so weird to me and you start to internalize those things and they are maybe I should maybe she's it's really Hard to kind of ignore what people say about you because I would be part. If no one ever said anything to me about my body. I would be perfectly happy always other people's stuff. Like I know what my flaws are in it. I'm not going to sit and tell them because you would never know because I feel like I know how to cover them. But I know I know what they are. I know. Yeah, I know that my body is far from perfect. I know I've got it hello work to do. But but I just don't like to wear that on externally, you know, I mean like I'm obviously confident and I am confident but I I know what I need to work on but I remember one time, you know, I was in the club. This is ages ago and I went to a ray with this is when I was Abed and so because I was a bed I had like I would never do this now, but I've gone to KFC and boxed before the right. Yeah, this is Ben favorites or Tennessee fried chicken tonight, but box a whole bucket. Yeah with my girls and then I went straight to the club after this is when I was a bad guy was wearing flats in the club and Gene. Wow, I know I know judge me later. Anyway, I was whining with a guy yet and then I could hear him talking and I was probably giving him the wicked is right how you gonna get the number and he was at know my know Billy's busy. Why are you still here? I was getting harder. I was got my the bottom kind of husband. When he said what he said I could feel myself sucking my believe but you know what that thing of sucking I never used to do that thing of suck in your belly is tight is tiring people that dress not like I just for what I think my body should be it. I don't like I don't overdo myself like whatever in it, but this time I must have felt like my belly was flat wherever I walk up sober. I hate that that's because I could never wear clothes. They were wearing high-waisted that minimum have it or not. And I know and the thing is I don't even know for sure your combat. You feel bad about something. It's Yeah Yeah from you know, your high waisted jeans have literally saved my life. I know somebody that said that I met me when I was very very very young. So I was the size 6 when I was younger when I was about 16 and I used to love wearing hipsters. Like, you know, they'll just be on your hips and you'd wear a nice little girl. Yeah jeans lay on your hips and now they don't come lower than your boobs. I like they do they really do. They are but listen, if you told me in 2003, they're too big in how many ever years time you could be wearing high-waisted jeans. I would have been like are you mad Neva these Colombian jeans. I'm never coming off of me the ones with no pockets on the back never walk around with those and literally my zip if the zip was any any longer than my pinky. I wouldn't buy them. Yeah, cause that's something that I would have to shave where the gene was. My body isn't where I want it to be but saying that I'll sit there and complain and I still won't do anything about it. My what my frustration is, basically when I see you. And I quote unquote like bigger than me and like they have the confidence to wear things that I'm like I can never wear. Yeah, and I think they look amazing in it. And that's what the fuck is wrong with you and why have you got in your head that you can't wear this you can't wear this because what I think that there's confidence and I think but I do think that not everything is for everybody though. Should I be like even someone that quote unquote has the perfect body? There's something that they can't wear. Yeah. I mean because you can be really Slim's you can be really Slim. Yeah and have an amazing body and have no boobs. Yeah, and if you've got like really Ali small breasts than you probably shouldn't wear like like trying to cleavage but the thing is I think you can and should wear whatever you want. It just depends on how good you think it looks and how you feel about. Yeah, like, you know, I'm making some things look like literally I like I said, there's a lot of things I see them lie. You look fine. You know my Lane. I know what I should and shouldn't be wearing but sometimes I do go over it. Like I'm like if I think it depends on the day, sometimes I get really really excited. And so, you know, maybe that morning. I've not eaten bread and I'm like, I feel really really flat then it just goes downhill after that and it's always because the hunger takes over and I'll be okay and then it's not until I can't fit into something that I you know, when you have a vision of how you're going to look in the in something and then it doesn't work. I'm just like wow my mother does it then I'm not going to because some of the girls that I work with. Yeah, they are so discipline like they literally they eat for fuel. We don't like join I can never see myself go. I really want a salad. Like I really just want you know, I think it's a cultural thing as well because I've grown up on rice do not like chili con carne. Miss glassons juice just have ice. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah science partner called it coconut like it's actually mad. I really love I think I think I'm bigger than what I am you do. Are you coming? Yeah in size for yeah, and I'm like, those are my best friend always held because when I go and buy stuff or if I buy stuff online, I always tend to go bigger than small arm because I don't ever think. Oh, maybe it'll be a bit too big. I always think maybe that's why the small for your shit. I need to he's a way to smoke. A shocking shops anymore. Like when I say, yeah. Yeah, and I bought like this shirt first with the shirt was too small this gaping like you can see all my bra is a hot-ass mess and it was depressing because it was a large as well as I went into the shop. And I said I never shop in shock that you know, they have the front room. They have their back everything. Everything is my wig was bloated. I was a hot mess. I was just I was so upset.

Let's Jump Right In So I feel like if you're listening to this, you probably want to become a network marketing machine, right? So I'll just tell you that probably the most paid skill set aside from driving to events, which we can also talk about on the podcast for instance. That is you need to master how to sponsor how to build how to manage and how to grow your business and all I'm really saying is that yeah, your network marketing company might have great products. You might be an incredible retailer. You might be able to sell your face off and I'll tell you right now. That's all good and fine personal experience. I personally sold last year in 2018 $980,000 of products just me. That's pretty crazy. By the way. Thank you because I don't know a lot of you ordered for me and I love you guys. Appreciate you. It's way cooler that our team in our first year in business sold over 20 million dollars. What does that mean? That means residual income that means I can take vacations and get paid that means I have a business that is sustainable and has leverage and my family will be able to have and it has Legacy behind it. So you cannot leverage and capture the benefits of true residual income and truly network marketing and grow your business. If you're not learning how to recruit this cannot be just about sales and that is coming from quite frankly the person aka me Jesse Lee Eric worry, the basically, you know, Godfather of network marketing says is world-class in achieving customers, by the way. Sorry, you know how it is. Mom life will be has an opinion and I actually was told that She barks like this. She's scaring off coyotes. So she's scaring off coyotes. I'm being loud. She's deaf. She can't hear me. So we're just gonna roll. So the power of network marketing is truly in your ability to build your system build your team and then throughout that team be able to you know sell and move more products. So to be able to succeed in network marketing, you've got a massive out of network marketing recruiting and we've got to convert your customers and your prospects into business Builders. Now, some people are lucky you've got Got a ton of friends. You got a ton of family, you know, some of you are just naturally charismatic and you can recruit basically at will however, you know, that's not necessarily normal obviously, right? So let's discuss some powerful techniques for mess of growth. First of all, this is honest. I hope you're taking notes for not taking notes. What even are you doing? Take notes get out of pain pull over on the side of the road. Do what you got to do. Let's roll. First of all, you've got to make a decision you have to decide here. Now I am going to become recruiting Superstar. Everything has to start with a decision. You have to make the decision you're going to master this you have to make the decision. You're not going to give up and I'll tell you there are some of you thousands of you listening to this and you are going to give up but for those of you who aren't gonna give up. I'm talking to you make the decision to master recruiting and not give up. Make up your mind to learn make up your mind to develop skills. Make up your mind to understand that this takes time. Excuse me. I was in Vegas. My lungs are all jacked up. Make up your mind to pass your fear of talking to people and come out of your shell. Like I'm telling you. Yes, it's scary. But you're doing a massive disservice to the world to yourself to your family by not talking to people I guarantee there are people right here listening to this podcast right this second who you need this and you know moms were sitting on the park bench at the park that are frustrated and they needed and they need an extra income, you know business owners whose businesses are actually going on. This they need you. So make up your mind to get past your fears of talking to people and get out of your shell your decision to have a better life should be more significant than your fears and insecurities around recruiting and even if you're an introvert, make up your mind to make it a priority and do it whenever you choose introversion is not Annex is not a reason. It's an excuse right? Like for those of you who don't know. I am not the extroverted person. You think I am I am introverted. I like to stare at a wall. I just did an event on Saturday. It took me until about 4 p.m. Sunday to even leave the hotel room to get food. I was so high. Okay, so make up your mind. Your introversion is not an excuse. There are plenty of books on Charisma get a personality. Okay. I love you guys saying it out of love. So tip number one make a decision. My next tip is you need to develop a recruiting mindset. So if you're in an MLM and you're listening to this that means to me that something drew you to the network marketing profession. Okay. It could have been the product your company sells. All's it could have been the compensation plan. It could have been friendships. It could have been the ability to work with awesome people. It could have been the personal development whatever. Okay, it is enough motivation. I'm telling you whatever the reason was. Just to develop a network marketing recruiting mindset. Okay, you need to understand you're no longer an employee. It is not your fault or it is not your up one's fault. If you're not successful it is your fault. Okay, it is your fault. If you're not as successful as you want just like if you make a million dollars, the last thing you want your upline to do is go oooooh develop that person know you have to develop an entrepreneurial mindset. You have to be ready to approach me with your opportunity without fear and you have to decide not to be apologetic about it. You need to be brave, you know, you're trying to share a great gift with somebody you need to know that you need to know that there's more to this life than struggling then not being able to put your kids in the school's you want to put them in to not be able to have the clothes. You want the car. You want the house you want the life you want? Okay. So share your gift. If you ever want to be an entrepreneur a series on turn or not. I want to burn or I'm going and you want to work from home, you know in your heart of hearts that never marketing is an excellent way to start because you can listen to all the business podcast in the world, okay? These people are having to spend hundreds of thousands of dollars to start things up. That's crazy. That's not network marketing. It's not so I need you to basically realize that network marketing. Yes, it is selling and yes, it is recruiting. But yes, it is selling your products. And yes, it is selling yourself really but it also involves prospecting. It also involves recruiting it also involves training it also occur. Involves follow-ups, it also involves accounting and so much more event planning whatever else you can make it a a career that pays you full-time money. If you develop that mindset that's required to invest your time and energy into it. Okay. All right. I need to get some of my protein shake one sec. Okay, my next tip if you want to become a network marketing recruiting Superstar is you need to make friends. Listen to episode 42 this podcast. If you are not a likable human, I'm telling you somebody have a hard time recruiting could you've got the personality of a clam? Okay, you have no personality is ridiculous. You're not nice people. You don't smile to people you don't get no people you don't ask questions. You are is all about yourself. Listen to me successful recruiters and every six and seven figure earner. I know a network marketing has one major thing in common for sure. And that is we make as many friends as possible before they ever start being successful in our business. Because making friends and building relationships in your business with Pete pulp is a people relationship business is essential because it'll help raise your level of awareness. So what do you need to do? You need to get your little pretty face on Facebook and you need to go to the events Tab and you need to go under events in your area and you need to go to networking events. If I go in Frisco, Texas, there are which is where I live. There are literally dozens this week. It's ridiculous. There's no excuse why you don't have friends. There's no excuse why an Market in 2019. You aren't out in public making friendships join groups find Hobbies join those groups find activities join those groups go to networking things fine humans so you can build relationships with them. And if you're bad at doing that the only way to get good at doing that is by doing it just like anything so you can do this through various social media platforms. You can make friends. You can do it at your favorite restaurant with the waitress. You can do whatever networking events and I'm telling you this is very important, please listen making friends does not mean recruiting and prospecting all Love them because it allows you to work through people and find referrals. So what I'm telling you to do is make friends interact share add value get them to know like and trust you and get them attracted to what you're doing like today. I just added a realtor as a friend. Well, what do you think? She's gonna do I didn't talk to her about what I do really except for I told her I'm a Network marketer and she was like, oh it's so cool. But like I could ever be good at network marketing. I'm like, well, if you're good at real estate, you could be really good at working. But okay and she said She basically said whatever he was going to say, never mind. Oh, yeah, I added her on Facebook. And so for me, I know what's going to happen. She's gonna go on my page. He's gonna poke around see if Jessica, he's the real deal. She's gonna get attracted to me. She will start asking me questions like mark my words on that one. Okay? Okay. All right. My next tip is develop positive daily habits again. I'm sorry. I apologize for lucky. She's getting rid of the coyotes again develop positive daily habits. So I need you to strive to develop positive daily habits every single day. This could be your VMO. This could be connecting with one or two people. This could be going to a networking event. This could be going live on Facebook. This could be follow-up. This could be whatever I don't care what it is, but you're positive daily habits are super important. You need to call people you need to message people. You need a voice message people being a comment on their posts and social media you need to interact on their Instagram stories. You need to let people know you care or you or or that they exist to you. Okay, I highly suggest you look you see get carried up side. Out of favor, which come way down. Okay. I was just going to say I think a positive habit would possibly be introducing your business opportunity or even products to at least one person in your network a day. And if your network is small what did I tell you to do? I told you to go make some friends. Okay people. Okay. Alright. So this continues though. I want you guys to have more personal development. I want you to have a more positive mindset. I want you to have more in Your Arsenal to get over the hard things. Okay. You can achieve that through what webinars yes trainings. Yes audible. Yes podcast. Yes events. Yes articles books Facebook lives, whatever anything that will help your personal growth and expand your vision zoom trains for your team. Whatever. There's only one word. I can use to describe it. You need to become a slave to those positive habits. If you want to become a network marketing recruiting Superstar, you need to be consistent. The only people I know that can recruit like me and there aren't many of us. You are consistent. You are a slave to your positive habits because Telling you there's no such thing as Perfection but progress is perfection, right? You will change your business and you will change your life if you keep a positive daily habits, and also it's like armor like some of you really need to be developing your minds because you need to have an armor around you for negativity. Okay. Alright. My next tip is all the top recruiters. I know are just monsters about being prepared. Okay, they're prepared with their video links. They're prepared with their business. Cards are prepared with trials to sell their paired with you know, Facebook groups Instagram. Whatever doesn't matter like my phone is never dead. Okay, my phones do not die. They are landline until I have to go somewhere portable chargers, whatever why because if I find somebody who might be interested in my business if I talk to a human which happens every single day then I need to be ready. I need to be ready to share with my new friends. I need to be able to connect them to a video. I need to be able to sell to them right away on a trial website. That is a habit of a master network marketing recruiter. They're always prepared it. Matter they know what they know and they're ready to sell to you at all times. So if you want to be recruiting Superstar, you better start getting prepared. You cannot tell people. Oh, you'll follow a know you now right now. Okay. Alright, my next tip. Actually. Let's go ahead and jump over to the fan of the Wake up in the week. Today is Kali fee or a Burg and she says one of the greatest motivators of our time every time I hear Justin, please speak it motivates me and that motivation continues throughout my day. My life has dramatically changed since finding Jesse Lee and the Empire and I could not thank her enough there is value in everything she teaches and if you apply her words into your life, you will see the changes smiley face. I'm so glad I found her podcast. I Can't Get Enough. Well, thanks Kylie. I appreciate you and if you want to be featured as fans we all you do is go over to iTunes and leave a five star review with 505 of your other best friends.

All right, by the way, if you have already screenshot this put it in your Instagram and Facebook Stories post it on your Instagram or on your Facebook. I will comment on every single one. I see I will share as many as possible. Thanks guys. Love you and appreciate you. The next thing that we're working Master recruiters do is we tell good stories. Okay, I'm telling you facts. Estelle story cell you've heard it a hundred fifty times my God that is so true. Especially when it comes to recruiting. So you need to become a master of collecting and telling good stories that will therefore encourage people to join your business. It could be stories about your upline. He says that's croissant Mysteries. Let's download these stories about whoever I don't care Company products could be don't like people you hate hot just getting people you do like whatever Compensation Plan stories both stories how stories car stories truck stories debt stories electricity storage. We're just become a pro Storyteller. You should be able to retain and share all stories involved in your business when your prospects that allows you to talk to somebody and you don't see yourself in them. But you see someone else in them and that way you can tell somebody else's story and say oh I you know what? I I know exactly how you feel because my friend Andrea, is that the Neptune up to that the more stories you share about your company and the more stories you share with people the more you expose your business opportunity the world and the more you attract more people. And so I'm telling you all the stars. I know and network marketing are good storytellers. So quit worrying about the facts. No one cares about the details of your comp plan. Nobody cares about you know, it's this got it's a bad. Damn. You did dub dub dub that no one cares. No one cares. No one cares. They don't care how many millions dollars I made they want to know what I've done with it. They want to know how I've donated it. They want to know how to give back give it back to our team. They want to know about the trip to Maui. I'm taking the team on they want to know all the stuff. Okay, my next tip if you want to come in network marketing. Superstar is you have to listen and ask questions which ironically is what I said on episode 42 about how to make people like you you need to shut your mouth and listen to ears one mouth. Right? I know it sounds weird talk like coming for me because I'm talking into a phone to myself and we're not even having a conversation but I feel like we're having a conversation. Okay, listen and ask a question. So when you're talking and selling that can be really hard, right the only way you're gonna be able to understand what your prospects need is by By listening and asking questions and a lot of network marketers, especially the novices they don't listen they don't ask the right questions. They're so focused on the things that matter to them like if the Compensation Plan matters to them they're talking about bonuses for an hour and a half or maybe they're really excited about products in the person only cares about how long the business been open for. Okay, like just be quiet. Ask questions say what questions can answer for you. It's a really good script to ask people and then just answer those questions. Don't answer anything else. And if you start asking the right questions you're going to get Understand people better you're going to be able to have a better stronger approach to introducing your business opportunity and you're going to go to recruit more people. However, I don't know 99.9% Network marketers don't do that. They just talk over people and spin and try to give their best razzle-dazzle. That doesn't work in 2019. I promise you. Okay. It's not gonna work in 2020 or 21 or whatever you listen to this and three the year 3000 will work either. So close your mouth open your ears and ask questions. My next tip is like really I I need this is the one okay, like we got some good ones. This is the one enthusiasm. Why do you think all these amazing humans? Join our team? Why do you think they sign up on a Jesse Lee? I'll tell you why because network marketing recruiting Superstars are always active and always enthusiastic. Okay, they are pumped up. They are vibrant their energetic. They have positivity all around them. Like, who do you know? Who's the most enthusiastic person your life some of your brother like my God, it's you awesome. If it is me screenshot it putting it again story. I just wanna know. Of course people want to join our team. They go that girl is so nice. She is so happy. She's so kind she's always bubbly and joyful and excited and has a spirit around her like I'm obsessed. I want to be around her. I want to join your team like Heller, I don't blame you you're surrounded all day long with Negative Nancy naysayers all over the place, but their poo poo attitudes and their grouchy faces and their frowns and like, oh man, it's not good. Of course people want to join our team. Do you hear what I said to always active like they want people they can see always being happening. I want to follow and be recruited by people who've got the Instagram stories to prove that their life is good or their Facebook is active and engaged and enthusiastic and energetic and vibrant. Okay, that's what people are attracted to people are not attracted to negative and negativity. People are not attracted to low energy people. They're just not in this day and age, they're not so be enthusiastic. I want to think about that most enthusiastic person, you know, like you probably will smile on your face and that's the kind of spirit. You've got to have when you're a Network marketer. So the people Are comfortable with you so that people smile when they're around you and some people want to join your team. Okay, and then my next tip made my last tip, I don't know I might ramble, you know, this is the Jesse Lee show after all I'd like to ramble so my favorite hobby just kidding. You've got to be a bigger dreamer, you know, some of you have a hard time recruiting because your goal was to recruit to people like to make $1,000 a month. Well, that's not gonna work. You've got to have Big Dreams one of the best and biggest attributes of anybody. I know who Is making six seven eight figures a year is they have huge dreams and they nurture them every day like it's not about that. It's done. It's about the journey. It's about being better. It's about dreaming. It's about Visions about seeing things before they actually exist. Okay and stay steadfast when there's adversity is around. Like I know that stuff is not easy. I know some of you are going through real traumas. I know some of you are struggling right now I get that. We all have struggles in our lives not to diminish anything you're going through. Okay, but I'm gonna tell you right now your Is be bigger than the stress you need to think about outrageous dreams of massive success huge goals million dollar homes the cars of your dreams the team of your dreams have a bigger vision and a bigger game plan because if you came into something and you were like I've never recorded before and then you recruit 50 people you're gonna be like, oh my gosh, I'm done that was bigger than I ever dreamt before re set your goals decide to be faster and stronger and make up your mind to recruit more and grow exponentially. What was tip number one? Make up your mind. We're make up your And to recruit more and grow exponentially. Okay, and then I'm just going to tell you right now no one's born a leader. So on top of all that stuff like you need to be you need to develop your leadership skills. Okay, you need to show people your leadership skills. You need to show people what you're doing in your business that will help start build momentum because you can use lip service all day say you're going to be consistent say you're going to do these things say you're going to recruit you've got to do it in then you gotta show it.

One of my favorite see scenes from Harry Potter in the books. And the movies is when Harry gets it learns to the wizard one cut so magical to the beginning of his journey to because some crazy guy that's really a giant guy comes into his house tell this is a wizard says he's to come his magical school and walk through a wall to get there. Anyway, okay, I'll come he has noChristian I love Hagrid I usually like but query what's up. Yeah, I mean no should be more cautious.

You're not a little bit about any questions. Yeah, that that's that's Harry. That's Harry for you. Okay.So one of my favorite Parts, okay, you guys might be like a little what is wrong with you for this but I like one Harry and Voldemort are fighting in the seventh book or movie because there are lots of deaths like Dhabi and Fred and George. Yes won't be you know in the seventh book when everyone died. I like to adopt he died and I can friend died. I mean, yes and other liked one Loop and dye dye lines all those from all those people died. I like it too, but I like it because I'm sad that I liked it because I cried and it made me feel like I was really into the books and it showed how much I feel like I'm a part of Harry Potter's Journey. You can't have a battle at answer the handshake twice. Um, all those books. Yeah. So all these books that like don't kill off their character. They all were having a battle just handshake because trust me guys. I cried for two days straight after Dhabi. I know she's like and she went to school and your face. Is that your eyes? Yes. Yes. All the kids would just call me. Let's just say I was they thought I was a little too obsessed with her like a little bit crazy. And yeah. Oh my Luna something is a something's wrong in your head. You're crying over a fictional character for for a half hour. Now, do you need help? So that's how those are some of our favorite Harry Potter parts and keep listening for more. Okay, guys, here's one of Danny's favorite parts or well so she aspect. Yes. She's stating something that she really liked that JK Rowling rolling din. I liked her JK Rowling described. Everything was such like detail so you can like actually make the character in your mind. It was like she it's not like she had blond hair and nice face. It was like Hagrid has thick brown hair and feet size of baby dolphins and like they took a whole page is this She had read it was awesome. Also, I really liked how she drives put described described places to like honeydukes. Like she made me feel like I was there and then when I actually went to Harry Potter World it smell just like that and I'm like, oh my gosh Ginny, it smells just like how she described it in the books. I mean, I feel really matching his JK Rowling was there was like this doesn't smell right? We must find a way to make it smell like the way it's on the books because you know, JK Rowling is doing that. She had like 12 different butter beer recipes that she tried to get the one they served. Yes, this was a little bit off. This was a little bit off. This one is the one yes. Okay. One of my favorite Parts is I really liked in the fourth book Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire when Voldemort cat-like took carry, when at the end of the book with Cedric and for a moment there when he was like it was pretty scary. I thought that I don't know if he was going to die or not. I don't know if the other books were about her mind your honor Hogwarts. I didn't know if he was going to die when they were battling because Harry wasn't that old then. Wasn't as you know, yeah strong also, the other books were called Harry Potter and well, of course because it's Harry Potter, but I just didn't know I felt like I was really scared and I really liked how I was like glue to the book like what is going on like and also you don't they know Baltimore's gonna die because yeah older more in the Sorcerer's Stone. Yeah exactly. What a fun word. I'm not booked like what it is a new character. So I really like that part. Like I really like that Parks it was like whoa, and I like the god.

I am just hanging out at home. Yeah. I am too. Oh you were at home. We're not in the studio together. Nope. Today is a rainy phone day. It's yeah, it says it pouring by you. It was the last couple days bad enough where they actually have to shut down to streets. Oh my God, because there's a little divot there. Oh and it flooded and it is a massive friggin flood. Well so that I had to take another route to take my son to school. Oh, wow. Yeah. So anyway here we are eight episodes in we have a great show here today. We're going to be talking about Our top five tours top five venues or just top tours and top venues, whatever we want to talk about. Yeah. So I mean I have done many many tours. It would be hard really to pick a top five because I've had more than five amazing tours. And and venues have been so many that we have done that have come and gone. But you guys also do a lot of you know, you know your venues that you've played and you know, the venues that are going to be amazing. So when you guys go back to places like revolution in Florida or machine shop or you know, those are going to be sick Nonpoint shows. So those have to be in your top five. I mean the the Revolution being your home base, you know in a way I do have a top five but I may do like some bonus venues sure because it's a little hard to pick but my my number one venue will always be revolution in Fort Lauderdale. I played it on the three names used to be called The Edge then it was called the chili pepper. Then it got changed to Revolution has been Revolution for for quite a while now, and it's just been amazing, too. Be able to say that we have been able to sell out our hometown venue. I mean, it's probably a dream of every local band down there. And when I was local down there, I always play places like Club Q foobar culture room, but when it was the edge and then Chili Peppers and Revolution, that's the venue that you wanted to. Be promoted to you know, and that was just I mean you've been there you've recorded shows there. We've done the Alive and Kicking DVD there we did the red pill their 20th anniversary. Yeah, we did a couple other things there and it's just one of the venues that I just hope it stays around forever. It's been Pretty consistent. I was hoping that there were not be another name change or it would close down and so far. It's been killer and we're hoping to get back there in the fall to do another show with Mitch. Mr. Rocha may come down and record. Yeah, I'm always down to go to Florida as long as it's in cold weather in Chicago. I'll go wherever you guys are playing where it's warm, of course, and yeah, I mean revolution has been host to many many shows and they they have many different. Genres in there not just rock and metal. They have reggae the of Comedy. They have all kinds of different stuff and I which I think has helped keep that club alive. Where a Jasmine just stuck to a certain genre where certain venues in Florida that just sticks to one genre, you know, and well that that area is is like all bunch of clubs. Like right next door was like some dance party going on right after you guys were playing and just like, yeah, there's a poor house right next to it. Yeah, there's fat cats. Down the street where cover bands play. There's a lot of places there that Banks can play but Revolution is the spot. Oh, yeah, every local bands dream down there is to play Revolution and I am definitely proud to say we have sold that out quite a few times. Yeah, that's been really cool. It's awesome to see what that many people and they're all like, oh gee Nonpoint fans to you know over there. They really know everything you guys are going to do. That's why the 20th made so much sense for you guys to do there everybody knew everything you were going to play they came out of the woodwork. Oh, yeah, I'm sure you saw people that you hadn't seen in a while and then you know people that have been there since the beginning so that's definitely got to be your top. It is definitely my top venue for anywhere that the second top venue would have to be the Machine Shop in Flint. I mean, we've been playing consistently there since 2002. Yep, every single show is rolled. I mean the last 10 or 15 shows. I think I've been sold out. It's never failed no matter for opening of we're headlining. It also seems to be the the hottest Nonpoint shows like temperature-wise. Oh, yeah Place gets so hot when you guys are playing we played a show there a couple of years back and the air conditioner gone out that day and it was in the summer. Oh God. And it was we were just about to start our tour with 10 years. We did a couple shows before meeting up with ten years and we played there. I mean, I must have burned the same amount of calories. I mean my clothes were soaked and then to put the knife even deeper in the situation the next time we play Frankie's in Toledo. That was like a 350 cat place and that place was packed and in hot so two straight nights of hot venues and hot weather. Yeah Not only was it hot inside the venue was hot outside. So it was like no way of cooling down and but the a machine shop is an incredibly special place. We have a great relationship with Kevin. He is always down for us to come because he knows what's going to happen. We know. It's going to happen. So and we have actually two shows recorder from there, which is the green pill that you actually can get on Nonpoint store.com. Mr. Rocha is the one responsible for recording and editing all the videos. So we thank you for your hard work as always sir. And God more venues. I know those are my top two. I'm gonna talk about other venues. I can't put them in a number. I can just take the top two sure and I think the next venue that one Benny that is not around that I miss incredibly is the Pearl Room. It wasn't Mokena actually very close to my house. We played many shows there every single show. That place was amazing. I mean it was like just a half hour train ride from Chicago. The train station was right next to it. So there were it was such a amazing situation for anybody coming from the north anybody coming from the south. You can ride the train to the show. You got hungry after the show. There was a Danny's right there if you got tired and want to drive anywhere there was a hotel right there. So and and for all the gym rats it was a gym right there. So a lot of musicians went up there, too. Work out. There's a gym right next to the Danny's. There was a White Castle and awesome sushi place. I mean, there's all kinds of stuff there that I mean, I don't personally like White Castle, but I know a lot of people that do ya and there was a great situation and was run by Frank. Yeah from FN from FM. I mean, he booked so many amazing shows. We played to a Sevendust we played there with Hell yeah sold out to the max. Both of those shows headlined a bunch of shows actually Disturbed played there as indestructible. Oh like a hit secret name thing. Yeah secret name and the show is sold out. I mean pact that think just right before indestructible came out or something. I think it was like a kind of a surprise probably their way of warming up for their tour. Yeah, something like that. It was amazing. I didn't get to go that shot just heard about it. I wasn't living here at the time. But man I will say that that place was as I miss it because it's just until literally 10 minutes from my house and it was It would be killer it for it to still be there. And I think people try to keep it open. Even Dan Donegan was one of the people involved in being I guess an investor to keep the place open with Frank, but I think the village was not interested at I believe there might have been a shooting there. I'm not 100% sure. I think there was a hip-hop show and there was a shooting so I think the village just got scared of concerts all together and but that's one venue. You that I wish were still around but I'll tell you some of yours. Let's see. I mean with the Touring that from 0 did we had, you know a couple of really unique chances to tour with some bands that I had never thought we would tour with for example, we played a good tour out in the East Coast with the cult and that was where we played Lupo's which you played there. I don't think it's called Lupo's anymore. I think they changed the name, but it's called The Strand. Yeah, it was in Providence, but it was such a great. Great show because you get people from Boston coming out and that was one of the the best East Coast venues that we played the West Coast. We played the House of Blues in LA and it was the coolest House of Blues that ever seen the second floor bar actually parted when the show came on like I don't know it was like motorized it was the coolest thing I've ever seen. So we played their well, that was a great show because it was with Run DMC. So it was, you know, amazing to be at a House of Blues outside of Chicago. We had played there and all the House of Blues is are very, you know, accommodating and amazing to their their artists. So that's a good reason to you know, play those places. So I mean, I really kind of you know from zero didn't do an extensive amount of touring we were only around for a couple of years. So we didn't get an experience like you've had where you've played every place at least twice probably, you know, and that can give you an opinion better on you know, what venues are really cool. Like you said the last 10 or so shows it Jean shop. I mean we played machine shop once and it was right when it opened in 2002, but the you know, the the venues that we got when we were on the Godsmack Deft own tour those were all arenas. So I mean when you ask for, you know a venue, I mean God me we played Red Rocks that to me was the best thing you could ever do so I would say that you know while you definitely have a lot more repeat visits to all these places. We had that opportunity to get on such a big arena tour and with Deftones and Godsmack which was going to pull no matter what Coast we were on it was West Coast Deftones East Coast Godsmack always playing in front of you know, thousands of people so every show of those I could say was the favorite but Red Rocks definitely tops the arena venues. What about your Arena venues? I mean, you've played definitely big festivals Arenas you've done, you know, I saw you guys in Springfield at a pretty good-sized arena with Disturbed, but I If that's you know on your list, well, we definitely played Red Rocks once awesome. We played it was a radio show Stabbing Westward was headlining. It was not Point head PE clutch and Stabbing Westward. Wow. Remember that what I don't remember there was other bands but man all I could think of is Sunday Bloody Sunday by you too. And when I walked in there and I got on that stage and I looked out and all I could do was a holy shit. Hmm. Like oh my God, I can't believe I'm playing this place, you know because Chic if you see the video for Sunday Bloody Sunday the librarian for you to you see all the stuff going around. I'm like mass at cool-looking place and back then I didn't really know I wasn't touring I wasn't signed. I had no idea what the place was or if what kind of History it had how famous it was or that stuff and when I walked on the stage, I'm like, oh my God. This is the place. Were you two did that video and I was just like just so like like the emotion that came over me and like man I am I can put this on my list, you know, I can definitely say that it was a wonderful experience. The only thing that suck was going up and down that hill Oh my God. Yeah. I think we had to go if I walked at once up. And I'm like, I'm not doing this for rent for the whole day. So I basically you had a van that would bring you down and then Vanna will take you back up. There was no way I was walking that. So the second time I went up I stayed there till the show is over. I grabbed my stuff from the bus and I said, I'm not walking down here until we leave so that was an incredible incredible memory another great venue that I played and eat and and the definitely not around anymore. We got to Cbgb's. Yeah, we did to one time for the cmj music marathon and it is as rugged as people to explain it to be I mean who ever talked about it? There was they people did not lie about that venue about that. What about the toilet the bath? Yeah, because you were like you were like taking a shit on a throne like a king a throne of Filth. That's right Throne of felt, but I'll tell you what the the vibe in that place that show that we played and another place. I walked into I was like, oh my God, I cannot stick front displayed here the kromaggs Blondie everyone moans the police Talking Heads to all these bands played on this raggedy-ass stage and the posters on the walls were stacked on top of each other so much that it was smaller than it originally was because the walls kept shrinking from a layers and layers of Post it to me. I always associated cbgb's with the New York hardcore scene. Yeah, because they have the Sunday matinees. Like even though I know a lot of bands played there what really made that place famous I think really was in New York hardcore scene and I can say hey I did it and I wish it was still around so I can play with Nonpoint now there. Oh, yeah because I can imagine the insanity that it would be and when we were a virtually unknown Known band but that show opened an insane amount of doors for us. I mean we went up there and we threw it down like we were just like it was like the last show of our life and our manager came up to us in the back. I don't remember that was a backstage or whatever. He kisses you guys have no idea what you've done and I said, what do you mean I said you guys just destroyed that stage. These people are out there buzzing about you guys, and I'm like, well, I mean that's that's what we're supposed to do. You know, so it was killer to be able to say that and say hey I played cbgb's you know, yeah, we got that opportunity when we were featured on the MTV Real World season 10 thing and all the kids on that season worked for Arista records. So it was like our label in New York and we gotta show it Seabees they came out they filmed it. They you know had Mike which is the The Miz now in the WWE he was on that season. He came out of Announced us I mean drunk as heck but still I mean it was a party and then afterwards we went to the real world apartment and hung out with them. And I mean, it was almost surreal to get to that point at such an early stage in our career and it was lucky, you know, because of that season 10 thing being hooked up with Arista records, but to be able to say that you played Seabees and I mean, that's the same thing as red rocks and that's one of the reasons I think that you know with you and I meeting 20-something, you know, 20 years ago or whatever we've Similar paths, you know, like as far as you know, we've we can always talk like about the Webster in Connecticut. We can talk about you know, like oh my God. Yeah, you know like playing they're playing its TVs playing at Red Rocks. I mean, I never got to play The Whiskey you guys have done that that would be one of my bucket list to be able to see like that picture you guys had in front of the whiskey with your name on that Marquee that had never that never gets old. I was going to say yeah that has to be on your list. I mean, you played the whiskey like the doors I played the whiskey and and Halen. Oh my God everybody. I mean that was that was the strip during the hair metal band days. Everybody was playing the rainbow the Roxy the whiskey, you know, like everything was just star-studded Rockstar strip. So yeah, I mean, that's definitely yes Seabees. Was that East Coast hardcore trashy place that if you played their people thought wow, you played cbgb's you know, that's pretty cool. I wish I would have gotten a t-shirt from there me too because those I'm sure they still Salim so yeah, but now it's like you're just trending you know, like oh, I gotta see video be sure but if you got it from playing there, you know, like that would be something yeah there. It means a lot more. Yeah. It's like a badge of honor. Yeah, so and yeah, man, I mean God there's the House of Blues in Orlando another place. That was great show. That's actually my favorite house of not not to knock on any of the House of Blues. That's my personal favorite because of the connection we have with Orlando and WJR are well. It's also like attached to like the Disney Village, isn't it? Like it's yeah, it's on Disney property. Remember when I came out to record you guys. Yeah, totally and it was actually all every single House of Blues is killer, but that was the one that I have a special connection with and I've been able and I've played every House of Blues now, I finally got that off The Bucket List when we played Boston nice Allison Dallas and Houston, we were able to play and San Diego we played it, LOL. We want the last bands to play that House of Blues in La. Yeah, and there was a we played that with 36 Crazy Fist and scared on fear, and that was a great show, too. Irving Plaza is another venue that I like playing the Hammerstein Ballroom in New York. Oh God amazing show. I played there with fuel and Sevendust. It was I mean over sold out place was insane. I'm trying to think what other venues I mean. I've played so many. What about the Majestic in Madison great venue as well. And I'm proud of course. Yeah. It's a very personal type of n, you know, like and the Raven Milwaukee. I think I can say I played every single room That venue except one. I played the upstairs with fuel and Sevendust sold out. I mean insane the only time on our way, we played it with Disturbed sold out. Oh, yeah, II am a all my God to amazing shows killed it on merch on the top place on the top. Yeah. That's the big I got to play that I got the I would love to play there again and film that oh man. Yeah, that would be insane but they do have rules about filming there. So, yeah, but The House of Blues in Boston as right now right behind Fenway Park awesome venue. I got to play their of twice once with Megadeth. And once with Alter Bridge both killer shows. Did you guys play Saint Andrews Hall? Yes, we did sold-out show at Taproot. I was in off date on the Ozzfest and that was a great venue and walk downstairs. Saw the shelter. That's where you know where yeah, we did the shelter once as well mile 8 Mile was filmed. I believe down there. We did our show there was sold. Show with soil so is our buddy Sean Sean Sean glass and and from 0 degree 1 degree of shot glass that mean that was where I we did a tour with soil. We did like a two week stint with them actually right when 9/11 had happened and it was we played a show in Ohio on the 13th of September in 2001, and we literally played for soil and soil played for us. There was nobody out. Nobody went anymore. Nobody and nobody was it was everybody was still Very much in shock. Yeah, but as we both know the show must go on, you know, because absolute music is an escape for people if anybody wanted to I mean the bar staff showed up and so we performed for soil and the bar staff and they performed for us and the bar staff and needless to say we had an open tab that night that we didn't have to settle up with because everybody was just like in that camaraderie of we know we survived something terrible. There's another venue Norva in Norfolk. Oh, yeah, we played there. That's a It's got like the hot tub upstairs a for different showers got the one of the best dressing rooms I've ever seen and area for the band's they got ping pong. I believe that pool have some video games and they have like a basketball court on the third floor and that great stage Great Sound awesome food around are a mall across the street tons of restaurants. Yep, and that, you know, and I based a lot on The venue with also with what's around it and stuff like that lately that makes that whole experience not only going to have a killer show, you know, you're going to have killer food around there. So when you play machine shop, everybody goes to Big John mmm, you know and buys that you know, I don't buy it from there, but I know so many people that buy so that's the first thing that BC does when he gets off the bus Beef goes and gets himself that bigjon and then comes back and regret. So I used to buy them way back in the day until I change my eating. But that's one that's when you know, you know, you're going to have a good sandwich and there's an awesome Deli across the street called the Brooklyn Deli that has awesome breakfast that I always go to but yeah, and another venue that I really like actually is a Scout Bar in Houston, which were playing in the fall. I'm hearing so I don't know and they have like the awesome staff killer lights decent-sized stage really good stage for what we do. A lot of people come out to those shows there. We can always get four to five hundred out there, which is killer and they have Ichiban across the street killer sushi French. He's one of the best Italian places you're ever going to go to you can ask BC about that. I have a ramen noodle place next to it. That's amazing. I can and you just you know, you know, there's one of those places, you know, the shows going to be is going to go off, you know, and we've had so many amazing shows there. There's a used to be as place them down. It's called The Canyon Club. Oh, yeah, we played there. I played it with head p and with a very young unsigned Drowning Pool opening up and then we played the Bronco bowl that was next to it. Yep with fuel and Sevendust and that's when I met dime bag and Vinny. That's the bowling alley. That was a venue to right? Yeah, amazing God of great. We had we played there with Drowning Pool as well because Drowning Pool was so big in Texas. Yeah. We had amazing shows their places. Sadly not around anymore. And there's also there's also trees and Dallas would kill her. Mmm. I like that place to I'm truly trying to think what other venues that I really really love. We did the Norva II remember you're saying like the whole dressing room area that was on our tour with nothing face. And that was amazing. Like the venue was great. The people were great. The crowd was great opening up for nothing face was amazing and I like it's those memories that Never forget when you've had those experiences of who you've played with where you've played, you know, and how many times you've been able to do it like, you know with with only two years of touring under my belt it was you know, some repeats like the Norva a couple times and you know Lupo's a couple times with the different tours that we were on so with you guys. I've noticed it the venue owners loved having you, you know, like because they they respect you guys. You respect the venue's everybody's happy in those situations like like almost all the places. I've come out to record their so accommodating to let me set up and do my thing because it's you guys, you know, and like Kevin from machine shop. No problem, even though that place is almost like with the Fillmore is you know, like where people had those live at the Fillmore recording so legendary things there could be live at the machine shop and it would be something you know, like you wouldn't believe I think people would really get into that and some bands would probably make some good money selling that yeah. I mean it Doesn't get like clutch Dead live at machine shop and they have their own merch there. You know, it's like that's kind of the only venues that almost outsells bands every night in their own merch and they give the band's the discount on merch which is a major so many bands that I know that has at least one machine shop shirt. I've seen him all the time. Yeah. It's like a tradition and you go there. I mean every time we go there somebody in our crew or someone is going over there and check out the merch and leaving leaving with like five or six things. Things because it's half price for the for the bands and crew. It's like if you have that laminate it's like your discount past and I mean, you don't have to go shopping in a mall across the street which is a dead mall anyway, but they have amazing clothes. Yeah. So I mean I said, we've played so many that a lot of close down a lot of still around, you know, the Chicago House of Blues we've done. Yeah, it's been great great to play there. The House of Blues in New Orleans has been great. Oh, yeah, like I we played everywhere every one of those places. That's the first House of Blues the one in New Orleans. It's got like the chatelet the shutters on the outside and I think technically what I heard first House of Blues was in Atlanta now, it's called The Tabernacle. Oh, right, right. Yes. Yeah. That was right. Well because they play twice with Sevendust amazing. The one in New Orleans has a second venue called The Parish, which is we played there with the with the cult that was Freaking awesome show like a little play a little tiny stage, but it was killer. Yeah, I've just been so thankful and blessed to be able to play all these places, you know, and and and be able to continue to go back to these places. And then since I've we started there's so many new venues that have opened that you know, I'm sure that we will visit, you know, and another venue to Rams Head live in Baltimore soundstage there in Baltimore killer killer venues. What would Frank the Frank did the the forge here in Joliet? Yeah, which was amazing venue. Yes, Mojo's and it was called the tree for a while and for just bringing so many shows there and Frank has done an amazing job. Yeah. He took that place for mode. As and made it amazing. Like I remember you guys played Mojo's and it was like almost not to say anything bad about it, but compared to the forge my God. Yeah, you know like it's like a palace now. Yeah, we are so we've played so many so many different places that I'm just thankful and blessed to be able to say hey, I played these places, you know, and and many tours are we've been on there so many tours that we've been on going to these places, you know, and You know as far as tours, you know, like my favorite all-time tour will always be the 2001 Ozzfest. Yeah, there's not going to be another tour that will outdo that one just because the fact that we knew 90% of the Bands. We were done every day by 11:20. And by 1:30 our day was over that's when we finished doing all the signings or Jagermeister and FYE. Hmm. And then from then on all the buses from the second stage were always Park together. There was a barbecue every day. Like they were people cooking every day. You see people different band members going to different buses. It was such it's like a just a summer camp of metal and it was just so amazing like and you see bands from the main stage. They had this little Motorized scooters all these bands have the scooters on there. So all the Papa Roach guys slip knot Dave Draiman the Lincoln Park is all those guys came to the second stage every day to watch the the second stage bands and it was an amazing experience to be able I mean, I saw Black Sabbath every day for two months. Yeah, like right there with Tony Iommi in front of me. How can I not say this was like not the best tour of My Life. You know is we were the first band actually confirmed for the StreetWise stage and that was just exciting when I got that phone call, like holy shit of you're serious. I'm going to play at or that I've been going to for the last three years, you know, I went to all the Ozzfest to get the name out there before we were saying that ended all the Ozzfest and it was just amazing. Just amazing to say. Oh my God. I'm playing the Ozzfest and it Sharon was super nice like her. Was super nice. I mean the world of security for the tour big vowel actually who was Pantera's security who sadly passed away. He was a super cool guy big scary looking do but a hard Heart of Gold, you know is really nice really sweet guy. And I meant just the camaraderie that we have with all the bands when we hung out with Taproot and pressure for five and spine shank every day. And we did off dates with spine with yes Pine check. I think we're on a couple of the updates that were mainly all with Taproot and Drowning Pool pressure for 500 tip and systematic. Those were the bands that were doing the off dates with us and hat like you knows Johnny pull did half and there's another Bandit another half and just like just the only thing that sucked about that tour. Was the fact that we had to play after Hatebreed every day. Oh my God, and I mean they were pummeling that crowd but at pumped us up, you know, we went out there. That's what we were selling records were selling thousands and thousands of Records a week. It was just amazing man. I got to experience the selling of albums that that huge massive like worldwide known festival and just the fact that who was on it. I mean, I'll mainstage you had Disturbed but They headlined the first and the second stage there were so many people over there because it was our second year in a row them doing it. There are still were already massive for it, you know sickness and stupefy there were so many people they actually got promoted to the main stage from the second show on because there were just too many people for security to handle and they figured that was going to happen every day. So Mudvayne took over the headlining slot and I mean you had Disturb Black Label Society Linkin Park, Papa Roach Crazy Town Slipknot Marilyn Manson and Black Sabbath on the main stage. Wow. I mean, come on. It's like holy crap well, and if you're done early you get to see those those bands like, you know from a different like point of view. You said you went for, you know years to promote Nonpoint at Ozzfest, but you never got to stay inside stage. No. No, that was one of the biggest like thrills as you know touring with with bands. You've always wanted to tour with is you got to see them from wherever you wanted and every night when we were on the Godsmack Deftones door. I took a different perspective. I was like, I want to stand by the crowd. I hid my laminate and I stood in the crowd and then I was like now I want to watch Stephen from the side, you know, I went and watched him play a whole show and basically was like 10 feet away from him and that's something that you know you and I have had the luck and the blessing of being able to do and you know, when you get some of those like VIP experiences where people get to do that, I'm glad The bands are offering that because it's a total different perspective of you know, what a band is doing, you know, and a lot of times you get to see some you know of the camaraderie that the band has amongst themselves that you never get to see from the, you know, crowd point of view like when the band comes out and they go out on stage. Like I've noticed you guys I'll do that fist bump thing that you do before you go out there and it's, you know to know that you guys aren't just going out there as a job and I've seen that with a lot of bands because of that side-stage. Did you know they go out there and they're all just their homes before they go out there. They go out. They do a show they come out and they you know high-five each other if it was a good show. That's something that those tours especially like the Ozzfest tour for you. And your the I mean ours was only four bands. It was gobsmacked up tones puddle of Mud and us and so it was a small but yet Arena tour and every day the catering every day everybody sat around, you know, during our sound checks Chino would go longboarding right by our Stage just watching us do our sound check and it was like the first time that happened. I was like, oh crap chinos watching. It's like now we just started performing. We started jumping around and sound check. Yeah because you want to impress those guys, you know, like that's totally totally one of the biggest memories of Ozzfest. We're playing Indiana Indianapolis that Amphitheater there. We were in catering probably everybody. I say like probably 70% of at least one member of every band was in there. Mmm, and then Marilyn Manson and to You walked in the whole room went silent. Yeah, I mean completely silent. You can hear a needle drop. That's when you know like yeah, I'm a rock star I'm saying that from the perspective of Marilyn Manson. Oh, yeah, like he walked in and said, yeah, I made this whole room go quiet. Oh, of course because nobody really used to see him he what he wasn't out and about all the time, you know, and the he walked in there with Twiggy and the whole I mean dude the whole room Stop talking like almost like holy shit. There's Marilyn Manson, you know that that was a cool experience and another cool experiences like on that tour like one but last day Sharon threw a party she had like magicians and all kinds of different kinds of people like doing these parties and then the draw singer Mike Shinoda from Lincoln Park with what He was he was walking with me. So everybody watch out League drummer coming through lady drummer coming through lead drummer Les drummer. He always called me lead drummer. I mean him and Chester were love them point. I rest in peace Chester. Oh, yeah, they would always call me lead drummer and I remember a show in Fort Lauderdale. I'm sorry, Miami played the Bonsai festival and Lincoln Park was playing there were behind me. Literally a foot behind me give him Massages while I was playing. Oh my God that it was funny because I was playing forward that day. I don't know why but I was waiting for that day and and they just kept giving me massages because I was hitting the drums so hard and so here we're here to help you dude. We're here to help you. That was one of the coolest things on those early tours in like 2000 2001. I mean the band's hadn't blown up to a point where they were Untouchable yet, you know, like they they were so normal everyday. Read a guys like we would go on Deftones bus we would go on God's MAX bus the guitar player from Godsmack Tony and and Pete from from zero would be playing Flamenco music in the dressing room, like on nylon strings. Like it was not it wasn't rock star, you know, like it totally changed my perspective of like what I grew up believing was all sex drugs and rock and roll and it was really like like you said barbecues and hangouts and you know, just like anybody else is world, but just In a much more lime lighted way, you know and and you wrote on a bus everywhere and you know, you had that luxury that people dreamed of when they were, you know, growing up as musicians another memory from that Ozzfest. We had two days in Detroit the play two shows and the night. The first night we all went to the hotel. So Black Label Society there was like six or seven buses and parking lot were all hanging out with black label. We're hanging out with Zakk Wylde, and he was pounding beers. I was back then when he was drinking pounding beers and and I was so scared talking to him because he's such an intimidating guy, but but I sat there and talk to him we exchanged stories and what nice as you want to hear unless you want to listen to the new Ozzy. Yeah, I was with no vocals. Oh, yeah. Absolutely. That was I didn't say want to say no, but it was cool to hang out with him. But I was like literally scared to death that he was going to hit me or something because he was just so like intense, you know, and but he was a sweetheart of a guy at the same time and as super cool dude, and that was I like something I'll never forget. I got to hang out with Zach and that's awesome. You know, it's just really cool to be able to share those experiences and and I said the off Every day you saw some you saw somebody every day walking around. That was not your there was no way you were not going to see someone that I said Raymond would come over every day to watch us and we actually we filmed our indoor video at Ozzfest and the Union underground's in the video Dave a CJ got some Mudvayne Jack Osbourne and all these people are in the video Chester's in the video Johnny from spine checks in the video. We asked all these guys for permission to be in the video and it it's just I said still my favorite video we've ever done because of the whole vibe that was created behind it. Yeah, and it came from that that you know world of Ozzfest, you know thing to so Disturbed Stone Sour and Flyleaf was an amazing tour to music as a weapon 3. I mean we were out with the number 1 and number 2 Band in the country who they were on the same tour and then finally for killing on the charts and we hired to the pain record. I mean we had an amazing time on that tour. Who has all arenas I'd say pretty much every show except one was sold out which I think was Jacksonville, Florida. Well that and but all the other shows were amazing amazing amazing shows and I had a great time on that tour. I mean, we almost home almost got kicked off that tour because we were in I think we're in Dayton, Ohio and we had a guitar tech kind of freak we call them guillot and Because you just say our Ghoulia is time. I like that song our guillot and we so we called him guillot from then on it was his native Ross. I was doing Ross and we were we were I was at merch and apparently somebody spit somebody from the crowd spit on and er guitarist. Oh wow, and then go low grab the bottle and threw it out to the guy which dumb decision guy was on the crowd wind up hitting the lady. Find him and her I was completely swollen and then no disturb had to make man's you know, they gave her merch all this other stuff. We thought everything was smooth over. We had it off date in Huntington West Virginia. Then we had a show in Nashville. Then we go to Nashville were told to stay on our bus. And when I got a crap what happened, so the apparently the the grid the lady woke up the next day with her eyes swollen shut. I mean completely just really and I'm not sure that was any threats of suing or anything but we we we were like we were told to stay on the bus. So we had to fire our guitar tech or I believe we were going to go have to go home. Well, that's that's when you fire the guitar tech. Yeah. We it said see you dude. Great gray, dog. Mmm. Yeah. See I do the worst. To about it as he had his girl there. She left in that same day two so man, so let's suck that. So anyway anyway, so and Mikey kept always teasing me. Hey, you guys gotta settle down. I'll be so tough as it did we had nothing to do with it. Yeah, he offer he would always give me shit and was always teasing me about it and it was funny, you know, but that was like the only time that I think we can close to getting kicked off at or about something that we didn't even do it was a um decision and if any guitar takes out there get drum text anybody don't throw anything in the crowd trust me. Yeah. Well the consequences are very bad. Well beyond that, I mean your representative of the band so you have to have that same level of professionalism and you know you no modesty. You can't be a dick one of one of my favorite memories that we were you're talking about, you know hanging out in hotels and stuff with during the Haas Fest and And Zach while hanging out and stuff when we were we did some tours with with stained and Drowning Pool and some other you know, like all those Festival shows that we would do and we were at this hotel and all the guys from stained were at one end and Drowning Pool guys were in the middle and we were at the other end of the hotel and CJ from drowning pool was walking up and down the hallways singing. It's been a while but he changed the lyrics to It's been a while since I've had beer the camaraderie that we've had with bands like 7 to us All That Remains hell, yeah. Mudvayne Sumo psycho, like just to name a few. I mean we've had great relationships with these people pod now have now after all these years you finally get to do touring with pod and that tour we did last year was easily one of my favorites as well because of not only the shows were great at camaraderie was amazing and it's just the whole vibe of the bands was just killer, you know, and it was just a good thing to have you know, when On those tours just be able to hang out every single day doing something whatever, you know, you know having a beer with your butt with them or you're taking a shot or just bullshit and talk about music talk about life. How can you know if they have families another know a lot of these bands now, you know now that we're all fathers we can talk to other people about families, you know, we have so much so much to talk about now outside of just, you know, hanging out get drunk. Let's party. You know now we can have like these real life meaning Ation, and like real real conversations with people and exchange stories and and exchange what how they deal with stuff at home, you know and conversations. These days is a lot different than once back in the day. Oh, yeah. I mean the Godsmack guys we'd like on off days. We they would go ride Harley's there's a couple times that they went to a hockey rink with RTM because RTM was from Canada and he was looking to play hockey. So Robbie the bass player from Godsmack took him to a skating place nearby and Massachusetts and They went played hockey for a while. Like I mean normal things like things that you you know don't equate with being on a Rock Tour, you know, it's like what you do on your day off. It's like, oh we went hiking and it's like that normal people go hiking. You know, it's like white. It's kind of the same. It's just you get those opportunities to be in those places because you're on tour. You've gotten to see Europe you've gotten to see Australia you've gotten to see, you know, many parts of the world that you know normal, you know everyday working people aren't going to have that opportunity unless it's a vacation But in your life, it's your job. And I like that's part of your gig like you're gonna go play in Australia. You're getting paid to do it. You have to spend money to get there. But you're going to you know be it's a business you're going as like, you know, you had to do it for work, but you also get to see some really cool stuff. Yeah. I mean one of the favorite things that we've also done it wasn't a tour. We actually just a couple shows with five finger and drowning pool at the one at the Webster and They wccc was still around and they did a contest with fans to play paintball. So we play so we play paintball at five finger and Drowning Pool. And that was a lot of fun. I was super fucking tired by the end of it because all the crouching and running I wasn't ready for all that, but it was an awesome like experienced like that. We were able to do stuff with other bands like that. You know, we've done bowling with All That Remains, you know, No, we when we were out with in this moment. We did like a shared VIP and that was really cool to like ya know. That's another band. We've had a good relationship with In This Moment. Yeah, great shows at them great people, you know, and I really can't, you know, I can't complain about my career or my life despite. You know, we've had some struggles like most bands. Do you know you have your issues with you know with just the industry in general I mean, but the touring side And I think that being able to meet not only band members, but you meet promoters. You meet radio station People You Meet fans are so much advantage. Of going on torque as there is life long relationships that you helped build and you for you form and help build and there's no replacing something like that. You know, like that's just not like like me and you have this amazing relationship now and we I mean, we only did one short tour, but you know, it's just like put that short or that's on my list of yeah that that because it was Mudvayne and you guys I mean, it's yeah, I know that's that's Tour, we got the meat and then years later. I said we come full circle here. We are doing a podcast together. Yeah, you know, I like and so it's everything comes full circle when it comes to touring as I mean, I still have contact with bands that are no longer but some of the members I still have contact with there's no need to stop talking to these people just because you're not in a band. That's not the reason you talk to me. Try to guess you really have become a friend. Yeah, and you have developed a friendship like I still talk religiously to Jared from Taproot. I mean, I love that dude. He is one of the best people I've ever met BC the original drummer had PE. I still have an amazing relationship with him. I mean two guys that I've still to this day I talked to and they're not in bands anymore. They I mean they've gone on to do different things but we've built such a great relationship that they've always and they still come to our shows when we come into town. I saw BC at her Vegas show at Jared came to one of our last show. Michigan and it's just great to have those relationships still intact. Yeah. I know what you mean. There's there's some of those relationships that ended up, you know benefiting me in the studio like, you know being able to work with people that would have probably not looked at me as a viable option for engineering or production. But because I came from you know a band that was touring with other bands that you know, they either had toured with or they liked I mean I've gotten you know the opportunities to to work with you guys and I've gotten opportunities to work with these twins that were in a band called the blank Theory here from Chicago and you know, they were they were signed to new line Cinema and that was like a really, you know tail end of the Chicago signing movement. They were one of the last bands that got a deal out of here, but you know, they came back to me with other bands. They were in a band called Medina Lake which was on razor and tie when you when you guys were on and they came they came to me for some drum tracking and recording and you know, it's really Given me an opportunity to you know, start working with a-listers right off the bat, you know, because I came from that world where you form those friendships and Bonds were people remember you from you know the tour but then they also respect you because you've moved on and now you're doing the other side of the glass you're helping bands like you said in and one of our first episodes, you know, it's it's the engineers and producers that give the band's the outlet, you know, like here guys. I'm going to capture this lightning that you're putting. Down and you know, let the fans here this because they've never heard you like this before, you know kind of thing and in the live setting it's a totally different thing every show I've recorded for you guys live is different Dynamics, you know, like the crowds are different there sometimes more, you know aggressive more Rowdy. There's sometimes more sing-songy with you with you guys where you can get them to react more and you form different bonds from the different sides of that business. I mean, you would have never had Chad Gray on miracle if you wouldn't have toured with Vain, you know, it's like how would you get someone like that at that point when Mudvayne was really hot and they had you know big records and it's like if you would have tried to do that as a band that you know never played with them. He would have been like who you know, like instead of like hell. Yeah. I want to be your producer on this record. I want to you know help you with this. I want to sing on this stuff. I want to make this miracle record big and you know, then he was on serious the other day taking over turbo and he's of course playing on point because you know, it's that connection. Yeah, I mean and you know, we saw him on ship rocked and he came out on stage came out on stage during bullet were the first band he stepped on stage with and he you know a couple days later he sang with the stowaways was able to sing blind with had on guitar, which is killer. Oh, yeah, and and that mean we still have that awesome connection. I had a great connection with him on Shiprock that song gave me a huge hug, you know, it was great to see him and he had come out a month or two before. to the Vegas show when we Play with POD at the Hard Rock and it was. I just great to see him great to see him, you know still doing it and new hell yes song Us fire. I mean amazing. Yeah amazing track. I mean and I we I said we still had that relationship and once he heard bullet, he said man, I know this song, you know, he came up there and he's whispering in my ear while I'm playing in the bridge. I'm like go get a mic I go get a bike and he went up there and just lost his mind and I was a very special moment and I mean in our relationship with China. I goes back to 2000 and now we're talking 19 years. We've known that guy we were on mud veins very first tour Ultra spanked Mudvayne an OnPoint as like one of the one of definitely one of my favorite tours to and possibly could that we still have a relationship with all those guys. I mean every single one of those guys we see them. It's always a hey man, how you been good to see you type of vibe. You know, it's never been anything weird like chat and Greg has been the one to guys. We've been you know have our biggest relationship with you. Yeah, and well, there's that great picture that came from ship rocked of Elias and Chad, you know buttin heads with microphones and you know, it's like one of those things I looked at from a different angle. I mean, I guess a lot of fans would look at it and say oh that's cool singer of Mudvayne and hell, yeah and the singer of nonpoint but I see two guys that are friends, you know, like they spent time together in ways that most people would never do you created together. No as vocalists, they bonded on a level that you know, you can see in that picture. It's like it's like as if almost the picture could be captioned like what's up, homie, you know like not even like, you know, let's do something big. It's like now let's just do what we like to do and have fun doing it because we've been doing this for almost two decades and we've known each other for that long and you know, why not? You know, it's like that's something that I don't know how much the fans realize how cool that moment was, you know, because from from a person on the other side like I do, you know know about that relationship. It's like man, that's really cool. There's a picture of a hug from him with Elias at you know, it's illegitimate. Yeah and it and it means something when I saw that picture I got I was overwhelmed with emotions. Yeah me too knew I knew what was going on in their minds the fact that he came on stage with us and had not been on stage since the unfortunate passing of any it's definitely one of those moments Where You Are Or Elias or you know anybody that knew how long it's been and who had played with those people and who you know have lost the I mean the the industry lost the one of the best drummers the music scene lost one of the best drummers the fans lost one of the best drummers, but when you get guys were like we lost Brothers, you know, like that's something deeper. I mean when you know someone that close, you know, and you have shared tours with stories with a shot. Yeah, a meal hot meal every everything that right there. It hits home that but I said those relationships, you know, like a we built with Chad from touring, you know has still stands today. You know, it's something that that's probably it most definitely going to stand forever. Yeah, you know, it's no reason not to Even if we're not in bands anymore, I'm still going to see Chad and give him a hug guess because it's just there's so much history and so much Sevendust. We have such a long relationship with those guys like so many things that have happened to them have happened to us. We've toured so many times played so many off dates together. We have Clint working with us, you know. Yeah. I've actually Texted Morgan for advice, you know like and it's just good to have that relationship same with Machine Head and I have a great relationship with Phil demmel from touring their relationship with Ralph Lane. I just text her rifle in two days ago asking advice about certain things, you know, as as great that know that I can shoot a text to a guy that I didn't really necessarily grow up with but we found the bond through music. Yep, and you know, basically my text was about business, but he took I'm out of his day. He actually called me. And we talked on the phone about certain some things. You know, it's like I said touring and all this this is what you you you tour for you build this stuff. Like you become friends with these people. Like I hate like when bands compete we're all at this all should be a Brotherhood. Yeah, you know, like everybody we're out here doing the same thing trying to accomplish the same thing and I can say I can a lot of these people I can call my brother's, you know, absolutely sisters, you know, and and It's been I mean an absolute just I mean, I'm just floored just the fact that I've had the career that I've had. I can't I just can't I just no way I can complain friends of mine asked me if I played like the Powerball or the Mega Millions lottery and I look at them and I'm like, I've won life's lottery I get to do what I love and I get paid to do it, you know, like if that's all you need to do in life if you're happy with your career and you're happy with what you're doing. Then you're you've made it, you know, like you've won that Lottery. I don't totally I mean it's like I'm doing what I love it's not I mean I didn't go to school for this. I didn't you know, I don't have a bachelor's degree. I dropped out of high school. I don't really have much of an education but I'm doing what I love and I can't there's no way that I can look back and say I regret I have no regrets. I've actually had arguments with friends when they bitch about their jobs. I can't I mean What can I what can I bitch about the thing is there is your problems with my job sure. There's problems with everybody but I'm doing what I want. I set up and do one thing was to get signed. Hmm go on tour and make a living playing music and that's what I'm still doing to this day how they granted everybody. You know that the landscape has changed people do other Ventures outside of their band some Stark clothing. So I'm start labels. I'm sorry management company some start podcasts. Yeah becomes dark podcast. You know because we want to win not only that we want to stay busy, you know, like, you know, we want to stay out there. I mean, I'm not doing this podcast for money, you know doing this because it's a great outlet Great release for me to talk about music and talk about all the positive stuff that has happened all the amazing venues. I've played all the amazing promoters that I've been able to play. For continue to book us to this day like guys like laying on an old Kevin like Randy Hawk always books is for the festival's yeah, you build these relationships with these people. That's just to name a few there's many more sure but you know, there's build these relationships, you know relation with the other bands. Hey, let's do a tour. Hey come sing on my song. Hey, let's go out on the day off. Let's go bowling. Let's have a barbecue. We did that last year with pod in the middle of Shit's Bill, Texas on Thanksgiving. Yeah, I'm Thanksgiving. We bought meet with turkey hot dog. Okay, but we ate hotdogs and but we were hanging out together. Yeah and have an amazing time together. You know what that's probably one of my best thanksgivings that I've ever had because I was hanging out with pod. We had a great time. We were just all bonding a different kind of family. Yeah, you know still family. You have two families have your home family you have your road? Yep, you know like I all my guys in my band those guys are my brothers till the end all in your crew is your driver and I mean, yeah Chuck everything my drum tagged item, you know, we have Casey know Dustin comes out with us Jesse Justin, you know Justin like they're all family to us, you know, sometimes they can't make certain tours but they're always family. You know, it doesn't matter to Lena. Who's our Black Label Society. Consider her family. Yeah. I'm I love all these people to death. When they've been amazing to us and I said I can't complain. I mean well I do I wish things were better in the industry. Absolutely. Everybody does at the end of the day. I'm still doing what I want. So that's all we can. Hope for man. Wow. We've been going for an hour. I know that's crazy. I realized we we also need to do bumpers for the Megadeth we never did that. I will do that. Yeah, we have to set those set that up and close that one out so I can finish editing that one. You want to finish this off? Yeah, I mean, how do you want to finish it? Because I'm in and I can edit this stuff that we're talking about. It's going to be gone anyway. Well on that note God who we talked a lot. We talked a lot of stuff and I even think we're able to cover everything but now but you know, they'll be future episodes where we go deeper into promoters into you know, things like that that can give people a little more insight. I think that like like, you know, just after our conversation for the last hour. I can you know say that people are listening or probably going to get a little bit of a different perspective on you know, what it's like to be out there as long as for example, you've been up there or even someone like me as It is I've had to be able to have all those memories and you know move into a different career in recording and still making memories. Like we can have a whole episode we should and will do one about like the behind the scenes of making records together because we've made some records together now and they're fun times and like some of the things like when my dog ate be seized beef, you know are those those things like that she gained 15 pounds of eating beef. Yeah, you know, like people people don't Get that so our perspectives are going to develop more. We're going to get some more episodes where people will really learn. I know you and I have talked about, you know, giving people that inside scoop on perspective because I don't think people realize what it's really like. So yeah.

I know Hearts Mauna Kea eggs a period in woman's life coach where I help women to harness the power of their period and connect back to that Julius Caesar palace in this episode. We'll be talking about all things periods vaginas hormones Women's Health sex confidence food femininity and all the stuff that goes through our heads. You'll walk away from each episode a few nuggets and true from as I don't seem to have a filter. I love talking about all the shit that people are too afraid to say say but everyone is thinking Hello everyone. Well, this is crazy. But if a change of scenery here, I'm currently sitting underneath my do not on my bed to hopefully not get any Echo for you guys because I don't have some full Pro setup system yet because I literally decided five days ago that I was going to actually bite the bullet and start a podcast. If you know me, if you follow me on Instagram, if you don't you should my handle is at Mauna Kea its health and if you've been following me for a while and you're an OG subscriber not subscribing what the fuck follow-up but like I don't even like this. Follow up because I have something like I'm not you guys aren't shape. Anyway, whatever you will know that I've been asked for a long time. I'd say nearly about a year now to do a podcast because I like talking as you would gather. I am quite the talkative person. I am Little Miss Chatterbox. Anyway, I'm just kind of bit the bullet because I was like, you know what I'm able to reach out to a broader audience, which is amazing because my goal is just to be able to help as many women as possible and change as many lives as possible. And also it means that you guys listen to me more on the go because I realized that YouTube videos and stuff are fat, but I love doing them and I will continue to do so, but two reasons one, you know, you can't download a YouTube video. So you have to use your 4G and like let's be real. We don't all have endless amounts of 4G. So that's like a real real problem for majority of us. I know it is for me and then Instagram live it runs out same thing. It's a video you have to sit down and watch it. You can't like pause it and shit so that also becomes a little bit annoying and Sir, just for me like I have to look I have to look like not done up fully because I always jump on Instagram stories and I'm like looking pretty gross, but I need to look kind of presentable and not to be on camera. And if you know me, you know that sometimes I am just not the most presentable person to be around. Anyway, this is great because now it can be like 10 p.m. At night and I can be out if I go to spare of inspo I can chat to you guys just fantabulous. Anyway, I'm going to jump straight into it and not talk too much about but fuck nothing. Oh, yeah, just a little FYI that I can guarantee that every single episode is going to have swearing in it. So if you are offended by swearing, then I'm definitely not your girl because I'm actually saying this to a new client the other day that that when you swear the moment that you swear it actually Cuts your ego out of your mind. So it actually allows you to just like Snap into the present moment for a second and that's why a lot of coaches and a lot of like, you know personal develop people actually use Because it actually Cuts you out of the sort of cycles that your brain is in of like oh poor me poor me when someone says fucking shut up, you're like, whoa, and just for that one second. You've actually snapped yourself out of it. So that's a little behind the rate like the reasons for why I do it but also because that's just my personality. I am very very real very no bullshit a bit Cutthroat and I don't beat around the bush which you'll find your kind of do that at least episode. Anyway, the first episode that I'm doing as in the one right now that you are listening. Ooh, I'm just doing a little intro. I'm going to tell you guys about my story for two reasons one because I want you guys to be able to sort of feel like, you know me and then you can understand the references that I talk about further on but also because apparently when you set up a podcast you need to um, you need to like have your first thing either like test it out or something or other and if you don't have your first episode and it can get like like they won't put it up. I don't know something random like that. So I was like, let's just be on the safe side dudes. Probably Monica a couple things to know about me. I often talk in third person. I often say Monica. Does this or like Hi, Monica, like Monica you adopt and another thing is that I talk really really fast. So if you will, everyone says about me if you are countless artists and me you might need to actually slow down your settings on your podcast for me. I actually speed everybody up because I find everybody to be like a slow talker, but you might actually need to slow me down because I am quite the fast talker. However, this is going to be a great experience for me because I'm going to try and practice at talking. A little bit slower. However, I always have a lot to say in a short amount of time. So we're probably going to like four minutes and 36 seconds or something since the intro. So, okay, let's start from the very beginning shall we will start at the very beginning. Okay, so long story short, I was born in Melbourne and then I was really really tiny like don't even remember at like fucking baby not walking yet, but screaming apparently actually mum said, I was a pretty good kid. I don't know. Anyway, we moved to New York City. So I grew up in New York. Update and that's why you'll you know, I'm moving to New York at the end of the year. I'm going there in a couple of months to do some talks and and to La as well New York has my heart when people say why are you moving there? I it's honestly like it's a bit of an art no answer and and that's not because I don't know but my answer is I just feel so at home there. I don't really feel a hundred percent at home anywhere else. I don't really feel like I belong in any other city, but I really feel like I belong in New York and one time I was doing some like deep subconscious work and actually I saw my youngest version of ever seen in myself. I can remember like what until I can remember like my earliest memories like five years old, but I was ice-skating on like the Frozen Creek but my that I was having some subconscious work with a coach and I remember being like really tiny like three years old standing outside this Deli in up on the upper west side mum was inside it was also covers a dog to be honest all the football the way to my own art, whatever bit random and I was looking at my mom, but I would like as made the older version. I was looking at my little young self and she was buying like a pink dress and she had a metal I had on I used to be obsessed with Madeline anyway, and I looked at her and she said to me if you want to find me again, you need to come back here. And for a lot of us. We're always trying to connect back to our inner child because our inner child is pure joy pure happiness pure love it is so pure and it hasn't we are born Perfection. We are born without any conditioning and stuff. And it's the stuff that we learned over time that then is what adds to the layers of the onion. So it's all about peeling back those layers to come back to the core and your core is your soul and your inner child and stuff and that oh my God, my neck is getting so sore from holding my dinner up. I'm gonna have to work out another way to do this and that's sort of another reason why it was actually just more out this happened to me last year and it was actually more like an affirmation of like right. I need to get my ass there ASAP. I already decided I was moving there beforehand, but it was kind of like a when I'm ready. And ready often means when you were like super financially stable because you know money's a big block from those people. You know me included. I work through it every day anyway, so I'm moving to knock end of the year, whatever. So I grew up in New York lived there. So most of my first memories and everything is there and from there that I moved to Sydney Australia and then then we moved to Melbourne for a bit and that I am back in Sydney. So right now I'm in Sydney love Sydney love Melbourne but nothing. Pairs to New York City anyway, so that's sort of like my growing up bit by sort of story in terms of like where I got how I got to where I am. I never knew that I was going to do this. If somebody said to me a new 12 Monica, you're going to teach you about their periods and talk about sex and femininity and like just do all that sort of like counseling brain stuff. I would have been like that's the weirdest thing ever and it who the fuck wants to talk about periods because I was not obsessed with periods or anything like that when I was younger, but little did I know here I am. When I was in school and stuff what I always wanted to be was when I was little I wanted to be a pop star and then as I grew up I was going to you know be a businesswoman. I was going to do my bachelor of Commerce at Melbourne uni had gotten into like the top rmit program for fashion design. I was very very into sewing in fashion and and I still love selling and I was really talented at that butt and I thought that was my thing, you know, but actually mom said to me a couple years later ones. Oh, I found my period stuff. She was like I dip down knew that wasn't your thing, but I obviously wasn't going to tell you that because we all need to go on our own Journey which was good of her. Anyway, so the reason what how I got to where I am. Right right right. Now was I was on my Gap here and I'd been doing my ski instructor course and we're still having an absolute ball. Like I'm ago it was the most fun thing ever. Then I moved to London and I was really bored one day and I went to I walked all the way into a shit. What's that? Department store in London called and then it starts with s I can't remember. Anyway, I went in there and I bought Sarah Wilson's I quit sugar cookbook and my mom had like talked about her and she done the eight-week program and everything and I use have a serious addiction to fruit to the point where like my mom would ban me from grapes because I would be so violently ill from eating too many of them anyway, and she you know said to me like maybe you should like so I don't like fruit like it's too much sugar and I was like, no its natural sugar. There's no such thing. As too much fruit. Well little did I know anyway, so I sat down and read this book literally the whole book in one day in London made a ton of notes and from that day forward quit sugar and very very rarely eat it and it will usually be some fruit As a treat like I never like on a day-to-day basis. I'll never have fruit but for special occasions, they will so that was what sort of started me and then I and then I was just got back into my cooking. I was always very healthy. So I was always a healthy girl at school. And I was always quite health-conscious but the wrong sort of health-conscious right? I was like the low fat calorie counting kill myself. So I burn 600 calories on the cross trainer after school sort of thing. I wasn't I wasn't just I wasn't healthy in my mind body and soul. Anyway. I was like the marketing healthy. So then then yeah, I was in London. I started getting really healthy again, but actually healthy this time having lots more fats having less less rice and all those sort of the grains that can be really disruptive to your gut anyway, and unless is quite a quite natural sugar and that was sort of what led me onto my journey and I was putting up pictures of my food on Snapchat back when Snapchat was like a thing was putting it up on there and one of my friends actually Steph. She said to me, can you just start a blog so I can stop asking you for recipes and I was like, yeah why the fuck don't I so I did and I started a Blog I traveled around Europe for a month with my In Sydney, and I said sugar free the whole time except for a bit of gelato in Italy because it would actually be fucking rude not to do that. And that would be like just unhealthy to go to roe deer Europe go to Italy and then not eat any ice cream. Like that's the dumbest shit I've ever heard anyway, and then so then I started my blog when I got back to Melbourne for my Gap here started it and it was along really well and I just became more and more interested in my health anyway and then fast forward a little bit. I broke up with my boyfriend at the time and so I was like, oh no point being on the pill. Anymore, so I went off the pill and this is sort of where things are a little bit downhill. I went off the pill and I was so effing skinny at the time. I didn't actually realize how skinny I was right at the time. I thought I needed to be skinny. I was still in the mindset of like losing weight getting fit are getting leaner. But I was and looking back on pictures. I was just like whole I'm hot. I'm like, holy effing shit. I was like skin and boring but the thing was it wasn't intentional. So the thing was that I was actually eating So much food more than what I am eating a now so so so much food, but it was going in one end and straight out the other basically coming off the pill my body lost all of its hormones. So I was making no progesterone and no Easter Jen. I was making a little bit of testosterone but even still it was such a low level and when I got these test results back, I was like, holy shit like they were dangerously dangerously low, so I started working on my stress levels I'd had I'll quite a bit of stress at the same time. Sorry. I'm just trying to get a little more comfortable. My leg is like breaking. I was started working on my stress levels. I started just trying to eat eat like a ton more fat in my food good fats, of course and carbs and that combo is what can help you pop on a little bit of weight. So I basically just put on weight right and it was I was it would took me so long. It's 18 months to get my first period back I was doing her. It's and all that sort of stuff. But to be honest, I don't think it has helped me that much. I think it might have done a little bit of something kicks out a little bit. But honestly, I really need to fucking get my weight back on because it was insane how skinny I was and fix my brain because my HPA axis was just screaming danger danger danger to my body. So once I fix that I got my period back and that was the end of 2017. I got actually can I point in just there? I also have seen the that men have on women Cycles in a good way and I actually really believe that my then my boyfriend that I got like second half of 2017. I actually recommend that he had such a big part to play in my hormones my first met him I didn't have my period still and and you know when I was with him, then my hormones were coming back. So I believe for obvious reasons like we're talking orgasms sex just being around men and all Is happen others endorphins and the oxytocin and serotonin and stuff. I actually really believe that being around men plays a really really big role and I've seen it be quite a few women and for myself and just boosting your libido and stuff and if your bully libido is higher then of course, you know, nothing is nothing plays a role by itself. It's all interconnected. So I got my period back for about two cycles and then I got really horrendous Quincy. So I actually had tonsillitis. I never translators before but it was so bad that I couldn't kill it naturally and I was unable to breathe so I had to go on antibiotics which didn't make me happy because I'd been on a ton of antibiotics before that. Oh, I have some time to start was I had actually going back to that in a second. So when I antibiotics are my for Maya tonsillitis, it didn't go away. So I then actually ended up a week later getting Quincy Quincy. If you Google it maybe don't go and images. Basically, it's like your tonsils get so inflamed that they Just like filling with pus and it's was fucking foul. Like I can't even tell you what the grossest thing ever. And I thought it was just like the tonsillitis come back but it wasn't going away. Everybody was kind of blowing me off but it was like as in my family and friends and and boyfriend and everyone was like blowing me off and I was like literally dying. I was like something was actually wrong. Anyway, I had to go to the hospital then because I was so unable to breathe so in the hospital and they put me on steroids and all that crap and nothing worked so I came back. Anyway, they ended up, you know being like the cat's Quincy and they had to fucking drain my tonsils. It was but fucking foul. I can't even tell you. It was like a needle in my throat and they would oh my God, I have full Goosebumps and they were draining. It was so disgusting. So the stress from that made me lose my period again. I'm very sensitive to stress. It may lose lose made me lose my period again. So I lost it again, you know, I didn't get it for a month and I thought it was going to come back, but then we all went away. May my family for an amazing ski trip and on the second fucking skiing day. I had a really horrendous ski accident and I was then in hospital and I lost my period again as soon as it happened. I was like right there goes my period like not as like a damsel in distress moment. But like I just knew like my body is very sensitive distress and my period was just so sensitive because I just coming back anyway, so I had a really horrendous he accident and basically what happened was I was going I'm as I'm a certified ski instructor like I know how to ski but a snowboarder actually hit me and my bindings. I think we're on too tight. So everybody please go check your bindings next time of year skiing. I think my bindings were too tight because otherwise my ski boots should have popped out. Basically it didn't and my need twisted and my ACL ripped off a chunk of my tibia, which is like my shin bone. It ripped off a chunk of that bar, which is fucking insane, but my ACL didn't rip. It just ripped off the bone like wild anyway. Partial tear my MCL. I had a fluid pocket enamel damage and college damage. So that was a fun seven our operation and that was on Christmas Eve that happened. That was a real bummer. The pain that I was in was beyond excruciating. I can't even explain how horrendous it was. It was the pain where you do want to die. It was the pain actually it was a sort of pain where I thought from this amount of pain you would be knocked out, you know, when people are in that much pain they That anybody knocks themselves out. Yeah, that's what I thought like I was like why hasn't anybody knock me out yet? Like that's the amount of pain. I was in it was absolutely wild anyway, so that was not fun. So I had a big operation than and I was on a ton of drugs like absolute explosive amount and that took me a really long time to recover. So I was in a wheelchair for about a month. We stay that in the ski resort whilst go was actually allowed to fly home. My family kept skiing and I sort of tried to put up with it as best. I could it was really really emotionally challenging and mentally challenging and physically challenging and and spiritually challenging. I'm lucky that I do have strong belief that I trust in the universe and I do believe everything happens for a reason. I've seen it time and time again in my life. And I honestly, I don't know how people live not believing that everything happens for a reason because that's just a pretty like shitty approach to be having every day. Life every time something goes wrong. You like fuck the universe like what the hell anyway, so it was really really hard but we were getting there. So I was in a wheelchair for a month and I was on crutches for another month and a half. There were they told me that I was going to be unable to wait there for three months and I kept saying the surgeon nut like I kept just being like no I'm going to be fast and I'm going to be faster than that and he was like you actually can't be like that's how long will it take to heal. But of course with the power of my brain and my really Really healthy diet and lots of bone broth and stuff. I did heal faster. So I was off crutches about three weeks before I was meant to be which was fantastic and myrcella getting back into it. God learning how to walk was the hardest thing in my life you really if you experiences you'll understand what I'm talking about. But your brains just like just walking on a car but like you actually can't like it says it's the weirdest in that I'd put my leg down and it would just like full-on like I couldn't put weight through it like it was it's incredible. How amazing This is why I love Brian. It's incredible how your brain operates. Anyways, I had that ski accident and then about like my fourth month in for my ski accident. I got an abscess in my in my incision. So as my scar was as my incision was healing which is like the scar on my leg. Now. I see this whole started to form basically my body rejected one of the stitches and it was creating a big fat hole in my leg, which was great. The pictures are absolutely foul. So I'm not going to post them anywhere. But actually if you were a follower back, then you would have seen them because I did post the pictures. But basically it was like this massive hole in my leg. Like you could stick your finger in it. It was you it was you could see like my flesh it was disgusting and I tried to it wasn't infected though, which was the great thing. It wasn't actually infected. So I kept it uninfected. Is that a word uninfected? I don't know anyway, but and I didn't go on. Through the evening of the doctor was like you have to go in anybody's house when antibiotics I was like why and they were like and I was like, is it infected and they're like, no, but and I'm like, right so I'm not going to anybody because my argument is if you're if you go in any biotics like it's just going to lower my immune system more and my means Justin's already solo from all the antibiotics. I've been on in a hospital and Other Drugs. I've been on why would I throw more of an immune suppressant into my body? It's only going to make it more likely that it gets infected anyway, so they tried we tried to just First we tried to allow it to heal slowly naturally, but it wasn't it was just getting bigger and bigger and I wasn't getting infected. It was just getting bigger and my surgeon in America whom I love so Fe much. His name is Jeffrey or I need to give him a shout out because he's the best. He's in Lake Tahoe if any of you have a ski accident in Lake Tahoe, he is your man. He was here. He was walking and she said to me if even if you allow it to heal naturally, you're going to have more of a big scar than if Cut it out and just and they cut it out and redo the surgery because then you'll have a line like you already do so. Basically I was like, okay, let's just do the surgery I gave in not even gave it. I wasn't giving in I just realized that if I like I was I had to keep going back to the hospital every two days to get the dressing change and I was like, I can't do this like this is ridiculous. So I got another surgery at the same time. They tore through my scar tissue in my knee. Because my flexion and extension was really really bad and my surgeon was what bit worried about it. My American surgeon. Jeff was a bit worried about it because if you leave the scar tissue for too long without moving it then you have to get another surgery for them to like burn it or cut it out or something anyway, so they also bent my knee fully and straightened it fully in the surgery which is creepy to think about which at least tore the scar tissue. So that was my second operation and I woke up. And had to go on crutches for a little bit more but then you know it set me back a little bit. But at least the the wound was gone and that sort of was my ski accident and then from then on ton of rehab learning how to walk again. Just getting all my strength back getting my body back lowering my cortisol. I got my period back about six months after my ski accident and I have had it ever since then which has been great. It's tough for me to hold onto. I've had one month where I was really stressed and I didn't get it but That's sort of my journey my period and really between the first time I lost my period when I came off the pill the first time I lost it. I was just wanting to know why did I lose my period like, what is the reason here? And I was trying to figure out like what was going on with my body. So I started doing a lot of research and I was like, holy shit. There is this whole world that nobody has taught me about there is barely much education about this at school. All I really told about at school was like we get a period It can you know, you can fall pregnant basically by looking at a boy. Like it's just so much fear place in our minds, right? And before I went on the pill, I had a horrendous periods like my pic. This is the reason why I went on the pill was because my periods was so horrendous. I couldn't deal with it. Like I would sit on the toilet and the blood would gush out of me. My periods was so heavy. I couldn't even wear tampons. I had to wear maternity pads and even then I'd have maternity pad on for 20 minutes and I have to get out of to change it again like it was horrific. Vic right, but nobody told me o it's easier to dominance or oh, let's look at the food you're eating all the stress or all these other things in your body all let's do some natural things. It was just like let's take you on the pill and then it will lighten your period Well, it's light on my period so fucking much. I lost it like anyway and FYI lady is quickly a pointer the bleed that you get when you're on the pill is not a period anyway, so through that first year. That was what made me get really interested in periods, and I just got obsessed with it. I was like, this is what I want to do it. This is a hundred percent when I want to do in my life and then the second time I lost my period it was again reaffirming just how much I am. So passionate about this and learning more about this and it just I just kept studying and studying and studying and understanding as much as I could about periods. And here I am now, but obviously in that time as well gone to UNI. I've studied my life coaching certificate. So I'm like ICF certified All That Jazz and here I am now teaching She went about their periods and hormones and health and self-confidence and and sex and all that life stuff that we deal with side note. Monica actually means to advise and counselor. So that is super random, but I don't even think it's random. I think it's a absolutely perfect how that has worked out. I guess some other little side note things that you ladies might be interested in is that I think at one point I actually had a bit of a Demetrios has I used to get such painful periods. So when I was on a gap here, I would wake up in the middle of night with like stabbing stabbing pains in my uterus. I'd have really really painful sex and I one time I was having sex and I just started screaming with pain and that was fun for him anyway, so so I know when I fix my diet and quit sugar and stuff it all went away, so I have dealt with a bit of everything I've dealt with the bad periods dealt with the people say except with the Endo dealt with the dealt with the really really heavy periods dealt with all the surgery and the inflammation and going from really skinny to that having my curves back and how that affected my brain as well and what I was thinking about myself and my self-confidence, but honestly some of the things that I have my ski accident is a biggest blessing I have had the biggest 2018 like So much growth and the whole process was just meaning to trust so much, hence. I now have trust tattooed on my ribs, but one of the biggest things that really I was one of the biggest lessons for 2018 for me personally was that at the time of something you're like, oh my God, this is taking forever. So for example for me to get my strength back for me to get toned again for me to you know, when I was having my ski accident Put on a lot of cortisol. Wait, no a lot. It was just that I started getting cellulite on my stomach now in my family the girls we all naturally carry our weight in our bums and hips and we have very flat stomachs. It's easy for us to like get a toned stomach and we don't carry weight in our stomach, but for my ski accident all the cortisol is just sell my stomach and I'll explain another episode why this happens why your body stores fat around your stomach when you've got high cortisol, which is yours. All my hopes are I was like doing hang up your stress hormone. But yeah, like I'm in a hospital right and if you look at like videos and stuff, like I've lost muscle and weight on my arms and my legs but then you can say like my stomach like it has that like it's inflamed as fuck. Anyway, that was also all the drugs are my liver working really hard. So at the time when I was trying to get my fitness back, I'm like, oh my God, why is it taking so like can't fit into like, you know, my shorts are too tight. My skirts tight Nothing fits me I I don't feel confident in my clothes. Like I'm so puffy and inflamed and all this shit and at the time you're like when the fuck is this going to end but honestly time flies one and two like I don't know how to say it. But basically at the time that's what you think but like 2018 is gone so quickly and now I'm back to doing Pilates being able to walk, you know, I'm getting my old body back, but you know what? It's taught me so much that your confidence comes from In its fuckin and everybody says this but this is something I'm really passionate about now was teaching women and my Approach is a little bit different. It's not stand in front of the mirror and tell yourself. I love you. It's just getting to the core of the shit. But also just being super real about it. Like the real facts were I had a horrific ski accident. I was on heavy as fuck drugs. Could anybody expect me? Expect me to be looking like a Victoria's Secret model? No, I had no circulation because I lost half of my lymphatic system. You know, I had serious nerve damage. Age I had horrendous like, you know, emotional trauma and stuff from it as well. I lost I was losing sleep like everything was frustrating and stressful and my body was really really trying to heal. So nobody can expect me to have ripped abs and toned arms. Anyway, it was actually just my ski accent that is has really been a big as lesson in terms of self confidence and self love and I know and stuff like having a bit of a Cheesy word sometimes but it's just the It's just the confidence within yourself and and I've never been able to you know, like stand in front of a never before my ski accident and I have been able to like Santa front of a man fully naked and be really comfortable or be like yeah, let's have sex with the lights on and be really comfortable and now since my ski accident since getting my curves back and getting my period back, it's funny how a now I'm like, oh my God, like I'm so much more confident yet. If I looked at my body this time last year. I was still I still had a little bit more weight to gain before I get my period add back and I was no not this time last year. You did the year before like 2017 right at my skinniest. I wasn't my most confident, you know, which everybody says, but honestly I can tell you it really wasn't on our most confident because confidence comes from your brain doesn't come from like how big your thighs are and obviously I've some days better than others, but I've really learned to appreciate like the fact that I can take myself to the bathroom that I can make my own lunch, but I can walk up the stairs that I can you know, I'm not walking around. Crutches to me being able to use my two legs is the biggest blessing that if I'm having a bad day and I'm like Oh my things I found out I'm like, yeah, but at least I have thighs that work that allow me to like do Pilates and yoga and walk and go to the beach and swim and have fun and dance and jump, you know what I mean? So that's sort of one of the lessons that I learned with with my ski accident and obviously I learned tons more lessons actually wrote a blog post on this but you know, one of the other lessons was definitely like trusting in the process. Yes, because I've made so many amazing friends since my ski accident. I've learned a ton but also the biggest thing that I've learned and the reason one of the reasons why I have the snowflake tattoo on my wrist is that at the time I just thought my life was going to come to a halt. I was like great I can't work now. I can't do my Bender events, which is like this epic. Yoga is Yoga events that I do I can't do all of this stuff. Right and I was like fuck this, you know, and I just thought that my whole life was going to be put on hold, but I actually prove to myself that when you Whatever you think you're not capable of. Oh my God, you are capable of more than you could ever imagine. Like I would sit at my desk and I would have my leg up it did have its ice or whatever the hell it had on it. I was running events. I was phoning people I was doing coaching calls. I was doing Instagram lies. I was holding workshops whilst I was like incapacitated. So it really really proved to me that whatever you set your mind to you can absolutely do. Do and whatever you think that you can't do if you don't think you're capable of it. I am telling you you are capable of going through so much more pain emotional emotionally physically mentally, then you ever ever think is possible. I promise you like we as human beings are so incredibly strong it fucking blows my mind all the time. Anyway, I don't want to rant on too much and make it too much about the Monica show more. This first episode is the fun. Come on. Shower because I just want you guys to get to know me but basically to give you a little rundown of what the podcast is going to be about. So it's going to be about I've said it in the intro but vaginas sex periods Health Food self-confidence relationships like with yourself and with others how to communicate effectively basically the stuff that I go through in life coaching and also my period coaching so a little bit of everything the podcast aren't going to be necessarily an hour longer anything or necessarily have guests in them. The point is for me to be able to talk to you guys. And educate you more without having to be like fully presentable all the time and jumping on Instagram lives. And it means that you guys though in most most importantly it means that you guys can access me in the car when you're going for walks when you're making dinner. It's a little bit more accessible than say YouTube or Instagram lives. So, hence, I wanted to make this for you as well so that you can hear more about what I have to say and learn more from me because of what I'm here to do is to teach you all in to help you all. So there was no strict sort of guide that I'm going off for how I'm going to run this podcast. Honestly, my intern was asking me about that last night and I was just saying I'm just going to flow with it. I'm just going to flow with that. My goal is to be releasing one a week. I think I'll figure out the day as I go along on them again into a bit of a routine, but my goal is to release one a week, but I don't want to have to make this a pushing exercise because if I'm pushing with giving information that it's going to be boring for you guys and it's boring for me and it becomes a chore and your subconscious can tell if I'm fucking bored or it you can tell if I'm pushing and then the episodes aren't going to be as engaging for you guys and I want to be engaging so it's going to be a flow process. I'm going to be recording them when I feel inspired or when something comes to my mind. We're aiming for a podcaster week don't know how long it's just going to be I feel like summer going to be 15 minutes and some are going to be like 45 minutes because you know, we never know how long when I couldn't talk for I might jump I might bring guests on in the future. I've got a few people in mind. A really really specialized in their field that I'm not so specialized in it wouldn't be about periods or something. It would be something about like a particular food group that I'm not a specialized in so I might bring on Experts for that. But otherwise, it's really just an opportunity for me to educate you guys and for you guys to hear more about the stuff that I teach about so that I think is pretty much it for today. Please ladies subscribe to the podcast obviously so that you can get all The updates and whatever and I would really really really really really appreciate it. If you could leave a review so that more people can you know jump on listen to it that sort of stuff and then I can just basically teach more women because that's the goal here, but most importantly please send me anything that you want me to talk about. So if you've got a specific questions topic ideas all that, you can DM me on Instagram or you can go on go on my website and fill out my contact form, or you can send me an e-mail. Hello want to create Stockholm today you and just make this up. That podcast idea or something like that so I can search for it easily because I obviously want to be talking about the things that you guys want to hear about. So send me all of that. And otherwise, I hope you have a great day or evening wherever wherever well blah, blah. That was good. Hey, I'm going to now I'm not going to leave that. We're going to keep shit real I need to get out of this do now because I'm so fucking hot. I can't even explain it and it's actually quite miles and Sydney today. So I'm like a 35 degree day. I don't think I'm going to go to record a podcast or If I am you make a little bit of echo in the background, sorry, not sorry. And also if you have a friend a family member or even a boyfriend that you think would learn a few things off my podcast. I would love love love to you to please share it with them because as I've said it 500 times my goal is just to help as many people in the world as possible. So I have big goals and dreams and I would really really really appreciate like you have no idea you can even send me a screenshot. Shot of you sending them a message being like you got it was in the morning squad cars, and I will personally, thank you. Okay. Have a good day. Wherever you are, and please please please.","– It's not every day that a podcaster goes on a rant about her menstrual cycle, but that's exactly what happened to Hearts Mauna Kea, a self-described ""woman's life coach"" who's made a name for herself on Instagram for her frank talk on everything from ""vaginas hormones"" to ""feminism in the 21st century.""

In a post on AfterBuzz reality TV, Debbie says she was inspired to speak out after watching a fan debate on social media about Angela Mills, Kalani's ex-wife and fellow cast member on Real World/Road Rules Challenge, hitting on Angela for allegedly hitting her husband, Michael. Debbie, who says she was divorced from Michael when he married Kalani, went on to say that male domestic violence is an ""epidemic"" and that female domestic abuse should be pursued no matter what the charges are. Kalani's response to Debbie's post: ""I don't know what to say. I'm a mother. I'm not a judge. I'm not a jury. I'm not a lawyer. I'm a teacher. I'm a teacher's wife. I'm a mother. I'm not a judge.

Wonderful people. Hey, my voice sounds a bit deeper than normal right before I introduce. Sorry. I have to say this out loud, but I keep asking if one this year. So my special talent would be that anything. Anyone says I can find a song with those lyrics in it. Yeah, what would your special talent be? My special talent is that I can say Peter Piper picked a peck of pickled peppers. I pick up your copy of Ibiza by predict. If Peter Piper picked a peck of pickled peppers. Where's the peck of pickled Pig? But because I know that they're about to call but your hands behind your map behind your back like, you know, you'll be in a nice restaurant. I like your be interesting and there's something been tied up which I haven't been so which is your hands go then when you don't use them on my thighs because I like playing with my tits. Yeah. No not there's no no you oh, yeah. Yeah. How many more? We don't ever come here and be like, oh, we are this and we rate we're an educational podcast and we got animals know that I know we don't know that for a fact or information I do now because you know, when you play heads-up if you played it with the animal category, wow, we've paid it together and it gets hard that gets hard time. Yeah. Do you not know animals ya know how you're going to teach you things that you don't know? Yeah all the time. I had a conversation with cuddly and she's asking me questions that I couldn't answer and I was actually getting angry she asked me and I know this is so simple and maybe I'm being myself out because wow she was like, so how does rain get into clouds? That's a legit question. I mean, that feels isn't geography GCS. Yeah, it doesn't okay, but then if the rain comes down where does it go after on the Plaza it dries up and it goes Yeah, she don't know honestly, she also needs some work. Yeah, it goes down the holes and it goes down the drain and sucked up into the grass. And then that's what sunglass to grow except around and we move again because then she started asking me then how does thunder and see how technology so little time my kids? Kids are you know studying them kind of hard subjects. There will be a way in which they can find out the max out me what those big high of 62 exactly have to do something. I can't even read it in the crate the creative stuff. Oh, I love the creative but then the officer suffered. What is your best subject in school? Art? Oh, he's Joe. Yeah, so you fucking kind of gone a star. Shut the fuck up in GCSE. In a level art what a little more weight ratios you a level is not just about like drawing that you actually have I don't know. He's I don't know any of that stuff anymore. But yeah, I got I did very very well in our I was actually really good job to pursue being an idea. I had an amazing art teacher called. And I remember one time she was like, she said me and a couple of other people. She's like, I'm really disappointed. You guys aren't taking doing art and University so long. Yeah, like actual pain. Yeah with like all sorts of pencil. Bye-bye pen all kinds of things. I don't know how good I am now because I haven't done it for so long. But when I was a kid, I was always drawing I was always creating stuff always painting always like doing things like that but haven't done it in so long, but I probably can still draw something really well. But yeah, that is one skill was just like I used to be like when I was in school like I would Like my work would be good. But then what I would do is I would do like a sick piece of art to go with it. And then that would usually bump my grade up and I right. Yes. I write something and then I do like a really good illustration. And then that would always bump up my grade or they'd be like, I don't know what you put in so much extra effort blah blah blah. But yeah, I can draw I wish I still had my artwork my a level. I know I can't remember what I did for my final artwork. I think it was actually a portrait of something and yeah, I did really really well. Oh that's yeah when I was a kid, I wanted to be a fashion designer. Mm. I love me. Yeah English and then I got to a level English and I love English was Next Level Next Level when I got a días I saw you walking is all of the natural to me never works hard in English, like ever whatever you hang it out. Look at the tears. I cried. That's the first time I failed at something I got you in Psychology. I have never in my life told anything in education. You unclassified dance? Yeah, because basically we had to do like this choreography. And the thing is they didn't tell me that we would have to perform the choreography again. So I freestyled it in it because I thought they're not gonna know. Yeah, but then when it came to doing it again, and I remember I dance to the instrumental of Mariah Carey All I Want For Christmas Is You that is She was like, okay cool Misfit and she's a fucking bitch, but she's like, okay do it again. Now. That's the thing that I should say again if you free start that yeah exactly, but I actually didn't think I'm just gonna be Bobby just you dance on that Performing Arts Performing Arts. I did know just dance I like we did drama as well to be fair. But I mean as a whole I took dancers GCS. I didn't take the gym Vicki Performing Arts music and English for Me I really really enjoyed especially when we were doing poetry because to me it was like songwriting. I loved it so fucking much and yeah, I had an imagination boy my music teacher was lip while you people but she's the biggest she's the biggest I started could and began. No being the best songs baby boy. How did that go? Hey my love for you. Oh, it makes me feel and that's what their biggest. Yeah. The first one was a bang on the video was them in like the circus. I remember going to that get this is big. Well, yeah banged Jamelia where she's not mine. Any videos from the last decade that really stands out to me Beyonce's all like her video album. That was amazing. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah, we cared about even that directs and teaching these song the video. So yeah that looks I really likes that what makes me was the small details for example, like when they were like working or whatever the screen was cracked and I was like that is such a symbol of my like quite working. Yeah your work your Not fixing that. They're actually fully together. You know, what did he think and and everyone's like and everyone's like are toxic goes to know why? Yeah, I would pay to look like her. She's like she's actually pile of myself. I love how I look but if there was one perfectly, yeah we could change. To look like actually between three people know for maybe five will be T cos content because I think she's oh yeah - yeah Louis Harvey Teyana Taylor. Oh, yeah, Teyana Taylor is ridiculous because she is wow and Kelly Rowland. Yeah, and it may be a teen chick Gabrielle Union factors look like almond butter mixture. No, I would have I would have Draya's body Jo I would just have Draya's body with Lori's face, and I think I'd be content. And then Gabriel o or tikkas complexion and then I think I'll be perfect. Wow, I'd be the perfect person. I like break up with her. Yep. Is it real? Yeah. Yeah, because you would is she must wait, she's older than their waists. Yeah. It's because the way where she was when she took the picture of like facing us you can see that dip is not natural. There's no way. Yeah. I think she's had some but we haven't really faced. Yeah, I think it's a bit of editing and I think she has had a bit of a nip and Tuck but she still banging on the left - she looks amazing actually. No, I'm not. Say that what you're gonna say so long as you don't touch your face. Nah. Nah, but yeah, then again, I don't agree. I wholeheartedly don't agree with Sergio. Yeah, which is why I see your face. Yeah. It looks like it was a dentist. No. No, I saw his makes over me because I was when I told you about something I'm gonna I would like if it's the skin lightening. I'm gonna be really pissed. Oh, yeah. That was the one thing. That was that that's good. That's the one thing that's gonna piss me off. Ugh. Yes last year sometime that is so I mean not that people weren't still do it, but at least the government of steps in to intervene and I mean, I don't think we're there yet. Not a lot of places are not there yet. So they've sucked like selling the products. He/she can always find these black bars are not allowed because I'm not allowed here. Yes that is illegal, but they don't care enough to strip it from the shops and stuff here but isn't and you know, why guess what? Guess what guess what do you think? I've been trying it does mean you're not racist. Oh my God. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes abso-fuckin'-lutely this country but one I waked him so much we knew he was different though. What's amazing about how he is we've seen his growth. Yeah this man used to dress in Nazi outfit. So this man was was not okay. No, No, and it's Matt likes. I saw a headline. He was like how is going from the life of the party to a woke up like sorry. What-what is that he's just not the outfit literally so that's a lot of the buyers that we have in the laughter. Yeah, none, whatever above everything about him is that he picked his wife. He puts his family. Absolutely exaggerate how much people like, oh my God. I can't believe you picked his wife over his fucking man his none. Yes, I fucking man. Are you mine? That's fucking disgusting. She chose this life. I just think you know what? I was mad. I was watching. Take heed that I saw on Twitter and there was a clip from LBC and it was James O'Brien and he's like, he's a white guy that's like quote unquote. Woke like he's really smart. I saw someone who didn't and they were like, oh, you know, you know, when these people call in to these radio stations off and they say things of such vim and conditions, you know, they literally that's what this guy we only saw the weirdos here. So we're like a outfit and Union Jack has to so bad bad fucking weirdos where it is called up and he's like, oh well, you know at the end of the day, we just think that Megan's changed her. Hurry complain. What is that? And he was like, well I ever met him and he was like I was like, but you seem to know about his change in personality. So when was it that you first met him and when was the last time you met him to be able to make these comparisons and the guy was like no, I'm not saying that I'm saying that I've been following him all of this time. And then he was like, well, I hope not because yeah, and then he was just like he was at so where's the evidence that because he kept on saying no making changed him and make him controlling. So then he was like, where is the evidence that she's controlling? What receipts you have basically, but I could not answer at all that he could not answer when she embarrassed him for it was actually so embarrassing and it just goes to show that how people's biases work because people don't realize that they're being racist just because they haven't called her that anyway the fact that you don't like her for absolutely no reason whatsoever. You can't come up with a legitimate reason you've got no receipts as to what this woman has done and yours is just based on a feeling that's what everyone said. I was just a feeling. I just get a feeling that she's like this like a Taffy take you don't know shit. She uh, she's ho for the fame. So if one mad exactly she had fun she likes and she comes from money as well. And let's be honest. Yeah, if it was Kate and William that I liked, you know, what we need to step down. We need a break. We just need like that. We just need a second to get everything in order. You know, the headlines would be por que Les be like, let's give her some sympathy but because it's Meghan because there's been things that Kate has done that Megan has done this same exact thing and the headlines have been completely contrast. I remember the first time I saw people going I was going to do that why she keep holding her belly? Yeah. Oh, yeah that one. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah as Kate Middleton tenderly hold approaching bump and then it was something else about how she's absolutely don't think they try to blame her for the for that Optional she was wearing a Megan was wearing off the shoulder one-shoulder dress and they were like, she's not following protocol yet. Kate is up there doing what not but for her shoulders, so what gets me nice ignore the allegations of personal injury and having a friend. You know that one but it just annoys me when people because when these people make these comments and you ask them and they can't actually give you a reason why and how they can't correlate that with it's just your Spaces by themselves to be that o is that there hasn't clicked on to them. What is that? That's why you literally that's the reason why she's got like a black man. She treat her dad so badly. How did that happen? They're the ones they've been doing all kinds of madness has her mum has been completely silent. Her mom has been a lady and she's been classified this whole thing her white side of the family the ones that are moving mad, but they managed to find justifications for their behavior. Of course, like they're like, oh, how could you leave your crippled sister by her crippled sister was going to go on Big Brother and also believe it's that Celestine effect. I'm new your no. Yeah, you are very much. That's a couple of hours her dad literally sold. So she wrote him a letter and you know, you mean business when you hand write a letter. Wow, so making yes American hand write a letter that I published it. He paid for it to be published and it's like I'm fishing it was not even an opener and I was like, wow, like wow actually feel so bad for her, but no. Yeah, and obviously this is like die down hopefully by smudging that the relief that she must feel to but gee I think so just to play Devil's Advocate. They do you think that obviously there's a hundred percent is racialized that there's no two ways about it. You can't deny it but do you think that on some levels like she would have known what she was signing up for tonight? I mean like I don't think we're your family because Dianna got a bad lie bad bad bad like some might even say it's worse like I never left. Sign up for something that they should kind of have a responsibility not every possibility but you you know what? You sound. Like I said I Got It Bad Dinah was also in an era where like Paparazzi was insane never ever people's bins like a different time or whatever and I think I would do if I was Megan. I wouldn't have compared it to die. Neither competitor Kate. Yes seem that bad some things and people mocked her because her mom is Who says she's not like Royal of course, that's yeah, but like it hasn't been awful for yeah, I don't think I would have thought and also because I have is not meant to be king. Yeah. Yeah, so you people think it's a child every yeah, like in my mind. I do like question the process of it because I start thinking okay. Yes. She she signed up to this like, but she didn't know what was Um intended for heard, you know, I mean in terms of like she didn't know exactly what was expected in terms of like down to the color of her nail varnish. Oh not being able to wear tights and stuff like that or having to wear tights. Sorry, so I don't think she actually knew I don't know if there was like a rule book of okay, you're getting yourself into this and these are all of the rules and the you have to follow the protocols but more likely than not I feel that should have known those will books. Yeah. She wouldn't have expected was how the media hates her. Yeah, but just Imagine if we could have some things. Yeah that thing hits. Why should I care? What people think fuck people? Yeah, of course that thing is like what is this imagine that on a national scale that newspapers every other weekend. Someone's got some shit to say about and it's 24/7 now because it's not even like before I always say that before it was nice. This is my card the next day. It's kind of old news. Now. It's consistent because you've got social media is just essentially everywhere that I can't even imagine will not leave here. I never really thought he was that kind of person who always makes the nice man. Yeah - come out of nowhere and you come out of nowhere again like again, I don't like that. Even her late 80s. Yeah, she's I think she's in her 90s. I know the queen mum live long. Yeah, we talked about how a long yeah. Yeah, definitely. But yeah, the way Megan's being treated like I when they announced that they were standing down or whatever. I was thinking our shit. She should think it was enough. She's 94 years old shot. She's 94 years old and she what she said. He killed my mom. Like it's not legit than I don't know what it is. But I really I really recommend then that dead that the ex Chef or something that Mike said listen snakes snakes from come out all sorts of that Corners. No just I believe they did. I don't believe the people you don't believe ya because from what I've heard they just they just went straight to the I thought it was weird that they made the announcement at Instagram. Like I know it's 2019 and stuff, but it doesn't seem quite and I know I I think I think a bit insane to me that that would be the case. Yeah. I think she does don't trust the news anymore. Yeah. Take the time to read the article and they don't actually know is that the this didn't happen then like that or straight when - to Australia fires were happening and then that video of it raining and Australia was going viral again. People were like no this happened back in November. This isn't now so everybody saying, oh we can all relax now like thanks to Mother Nature know these this shit is still It is not it is so weird that she can't understand. He's alive. Yeah, like how you went like even all these stupid guy gossip size when it started lying about me. I said, oh, okay. I bet ya about yourself. The truth will never be as popular as ever ever never. It's not sweet. It's never on there. He's on it's quite good. That's yeah, that's and it's just true. It's not even let me the whole night warp. Love God like the other day right actually like I woke up from sleep other day what Spirit he prayed against what he does that good luck. I cannot and even that what's been shut up. He's died. How many people never be necessary? No one knows now. I know I was here. He's actually mad at the fact that you just called him as a joke. Like I just cannot take it. Seriously the fact that a Apprentice man that orange Apprentice man is the leader of the Free World to me is actually sort of joke. Like I don't take it serious the fact that he tweets what he his world plans. He actually sweet and I'm him a hundred percent of him. His own account. He's insane. He actually tweets the leader of the Free World tweets to let us know what's happening and he'll be like yeah, Iran thought you were funny doing that. We're coming for you. Well, the president laughter between two schools and eventually like this is actually insane like the whole world is mad. He's a very good man. It's the whole world is actually everything. You can't trust the news anymore years these papers. Like I used to always buy newspapers back in the day. I die. Like ways and I used to read them and like I don't know if it's cause it was a different time where maybe they were speaking the truth. I think it's like used to be like a legitimate source of news. Do you wanna know sighs when I say things like a close was that closed-source a close Source here who needs the name, please? Just make something about this point. I can't even trust my dad and then I'll keep it. Well just the one today just there one mentality is really I think I tend to quote unquote trust until someone Miss. Yeah, I think that's the only way to live, you know, but otherwise you'll drive yourself nuts. But what I was going to say is kind of built up with everything. Yeah, but that's why sometimes I get annoyed that my mom because she's just like no they hate because my mom is just like oh, you know blah blah blah like You can't trust this person and don't tell this place in your business. And I'm just like Mom I said Mommy I can't live my life like that. I said, I'm over us how you lived where you internalized everything, but me I need to talk to us like how I deal with things and until people give me a reason not to trust him. I know that the people that I've chosen to be in my life. I trust him in it. So my mom said, yeah, I'm not saying that but but I know you are but anyway just to go back to what I was going to say just to go back to Megan and hurry. Do you think yeah, just making hairy mole taking the Royal aspect out of here. Like there was another point that Much do you think that you should live your life for your family? Because there are some people that honestly think that he was born into this life. Like it's a privilege to know. I mean like how dare you kind of just like for your privilege away not for necessarily For Love or for your family, but like like to a certain extent that you should kind of consider your family as well at how how important is it that you bring your family along or like make decisions for yourself. Oh, I'd hope my family would understand my reasons for stepping back and would and why I'm actually doing this because he's ungrateful. Anyway, I'm just playing Devil's Advocate. That's what people said I had to do for ya. I don't think that he is going for at all. Yeah. No, no. No, I don't think that because it is this it's his wife's mental health was his family is the woman that he loves and it's his son's future as well. And I don't think he should let that suffer because he wants to show people that he's grateful for this opportunity. But something that he isn't Royal is like, okay, but I'm not saying that I agree to satiate give it a shot. I really really like I really really respect him for what he's doing but I'm just saying at the same time like your that is a lot to sacrifice for love. There is not a single part of me that believes I should live my life on my family. Yeah, there's not like I get it and the thing is settled. That's a lie. That is a fucking lie. Let me tell you why that's a lie. There are many. Things I don't do in my life because I'm a black man cheering woman. Hmm anything. Yeah, like as into the point of that if I wasn't black or Nigerian or raised in a family that was raised in yeah, I would someone know know that ultimately I don't I won't need to be like it was when I went the child has had their child would have had probably had about a lot more unconventional relationship. Yeah. In quite and quite like oh, yeah, like it's open all day. So what are you saying that you that you date? We haven't done certain things because you're thinking okay. This is how I was thinking is it's so ingrained in the and thinking it's just a flat. It's just it's so ingrained in me that it's not even a possibility. My mind isn't even answer your phone. Yeah, you know what made you lose something? That's so far from your world. Like I wouldn't now wake up say I just got to get to work today. That's no been a thought for you kids watch it. Yeah, like that's never been in my approval on my further or anything. So I say that but then I don't believe so I should live my life but it's hard because I think that's explain it well because it when you everything you're saying if you break it down ultimately goes back to family. There's a lot of things I don't do because I'm black religious and Nigerian. Yeah, which goes back to family because ultimately your family people up for you up to Yeah, I know things, you know, I mean and then obviously like you started thinking like like there is going to be a reflection of them as well. Do you not think that like let's say if you made a decision, yeah, does it any kind of is like that then there's little things that yeah. Yeah. I think I am like that as well to a certain extent but you know how I always talk about like happiness being the bad girl, whatever like now, I think that I don't have that anymore. Like now this is not the bag. Ugh, no, no, no that stays like no like I'm going to do what the fuck I want to do. You know, I mean, like what if I decided I wanted to get a divorce. Yeah, I would be like the old me would be like no because my parents put all this money into your wedding and my parents will be so disappointed in me and my parents my brother and my family but now just let you know if I want a fucking kids. Of course, I'm going to get divorced if God forbid I but I'm just I mean and now I'm just Now if I want to do that, I'm going to do it thinks that that and more like it now so like if I'm like before they're sent things like how do you that yeah blah, you know, my mom's going to people come support my mom. Yeah, whatever whatever and that's also a thing for me majorly because my mom was a single parent with three girls. Yeah. We were also adamant on that. We were in my mum's literal reflection. Yeah anything we did that was fucked up reflected up. My mom was a bad man. Yeah, my mom brought us up like that. She saw this without don't shame me. Yeah that there was a consistent like Please don't like there was a saying this in your bar. I'm not saying I don't know what it means but it basically means that Like Em cover my shame. Mmm. So even the things that go mad at home or whatever don't go out in the world and start moving married as well that you don't mean like like that's a shiatsu. Is she with me like don't expose us. Yeah. Yeah, where was going on don't expose. Yeah. It's like I was definitely blow up with that in this kind of like my mom's house and I don't want us to end up with a word. And then people will almost shit my oh she had a husband is from the happened to her. You always do blame the mom. Now what just like good kids belong to the dad and back along to the mum when the kid is done by is the way it is so but now I have got some point of life. I'm not going to be mad. I'm not going to shame you but I'm gonna do what makes me happy. Mmm, honey. Exactly. I think there's a difference. I mean not doing something because you don't want to let someone down and doing and doing what makes you happy. Yeah, I mean because just because my version of happiness doesn't fit with what your idea is for me doesn't mean I shouldn't do it but it doesn't mean it's a shameful thing in a respectful way as well. It doesn't have to be like, oh here fuck you. This is what I'm doing. It's just like Mom like I understand that this is what you'd want for me, but I'm happier like this and I really feel like I had hope that when Kathie Lee has older and she comes to me with something that I don't necessarily agree with or something that I haven't like instilled into her. I hope that I wouldn't be that Mom where I'm just like really really really upset about it. I think you would because I think that the way we are living now is different to how are ya and I think that with the way our parents raised us like, you know, you take the meat and you throw away the bones in it that you keep the good stuff and you get disregard for their stuff and I think ultimately because we we live in a time now where we were so aware that happiness is the bag and whatever that looks like for you you've got to get I think that would be reflected in how you reacted. But it to get it depends on what it depends on what it is. Chuckles but I can't live my life for you my people no. Yeah, that's not it means how much we don't know exactly and that's just what we did, you know, there are questions that you want to ask but you don't want to ask because I don't question you mind your business and you no matter what I could win a Nobel Prize and I'm not so day my boy said clap for yourself. Yeah, cause she doesn't end of that she does. Yes. Yeah, exactly. Yeah, it's always that you've used to hold the door. Yeah, even my auntie to ask me. So when you going up next factor for her that is that everyone's goals. Yeah. That is it. You're on TV. Do you know why I am? Like normal people. I read those did the reunions because that was recent. That was X Factor. That was so excited to hear think it will I don't know complaints. I've been to that is again was sent as he came in and he also was a boy band called they're trying to oh, yeah, it was when he used to these men are like thugs out that content and it's like then do singing battle Yeah. I love your battles that so what happened to that man a cigar he did his umbrella and Bentley funds. I know. Yeah funds a bitch. That's his real name. Like what it's like you have yet like yeah, I'd like for example at the girls from Danity Kane that on. Yeah, well people from random way panting a shows and girl band of their to known to work, but they're not making money. And I wonder if there's so many I don't think that they're still married though the glasses yeah classic white man marries a cheeky gum out of music was what the fuck is cheeky Chief Langley that was shit actually went. Oh my God, even the guy from S Club 7 and when I was pretty irrelevant, he was on have no not badly cool. No the blond one. There was another one that was so into Available. He was like the guy your dad can't even like the guy from Black Eyed Peas the Mexican wine recognize if anything's no no, I'm not. Might I love Island and stripping the girls get so so yeah used to be in a group like one and group and she was like, oh really like what group and he's and he said are S Club 7 and she was like you're lying like no that's out of order that they are because you know as exactly they gave us the beach exactly. They never had a dream come true love is We'll pick your name Chicago. I should know but love never knew what to thank God. No, I don't think they know what they do. That's why they make even Latif without you nothing about it. Yeah, not the new chain haunted now he went mad. He was recently on like the shade room, but he said going on people who was he would have caught him be upset obviously. Yeah, and yeah imagine it bad. Yeah, he was if he comes with 2 to the 3 to the forge, and if I offended thee Out and cast it from the faces of profit for the that one of thy members should perish so basically like I don't think God meant it you okay? Yeah. Yeah. I feel like I've already as if you're in a circle and someone in your circle is allowing you to move mad take yourself out because you're better off taking that person out than the members getting bigger, but it's glitchy easier. That's why I just another are a lot of artists I do you think about that? I'm just like, yeah, I wonder what You doing I'm gonna put them for Instagram. Do you know the randomly the other dress I thinking about because he is she what is she doing now? She does like speaking and that motivation. Like a big bumper All-Star, man. Yeah.

Yeah. Yeah, you're right. She was on a shield and TV. Honda had them from the gladion. He meet Anna you guys went nice these two presenters that because obviously that is a Nickelodeon convenient and Yolanda and they were on Nickelodeon back in the day, but that was probably you guys wouldn't know them. No shame in the real world as well the real world. Yeah, that was like the first and then actually be shy I never watch it. I just remember seeing on MTV all the time. Yeah. It's gonna Buckle Orange County was the one I see I yeah just watch the hills the hills of the like that show. I don't think anyone watched it when they brought it back. Yeah, and I'm right-handed up on YouTube that other day looking at like little clips of like the first series of Talia the first series of Made in Chelsea excited. She did this year Made in Chelsea watch out and watching Posh people argue is the funniest I when I watched it when I re-watched it back recent. I was like, I can't actually believe he's the famous entertaining. Yeah. Well, maybe I'm so shit never watch. I never got into it. No, but your waist and love it and I kept coming back to the video. A of Jammer and Charlie when Charlie was the dance and then Gemma was human. She looks like believe it Bobby. I can't believe that he's doing this like the first scene where she was like a car Kyle cast Kiowa Car Sales woman. Yeah. She's like, yeah, you're right get you like this car. But yeah, that's for sure. What they've done with their money and fucking hours, you know what you can call Essex people dim all you want but they're fucking smart all of them. They take their house. One of them is going into property. They own houses. I think--for McCann's house is worth something that 1.2 million pounds all of them like Billy obviously billion Sam. I've done really well Mark critz done. Really? Well Joey Essex has like a mask. Like all of their houses are Elite like I get up and I was like why like that's a smart way to turn reality money into yeah what this is Wish I was going to say I don't think I would you know, now I would do something more like how we or something like that. I wouldn't do something where it's like. Like a company like June, I mean like big brother or something where it's like they're testing your strength. Like I want to be tested. I would have went out with my husband want to get my hair and makeup done on the beach and it was that time. I do not stay there and I remember when I didn't have to make them eat way things yet opened the thing and it was shaky really I would like to me I would have banned the shocking. Why would people that's nice. So why lie the only thing because I would I want to change myself to make sure I stayed because I want and also I want to lose weight, but all I wouldn't I wouldn't want to do any of that. Like the water challenges or like, you know, when you have to be in like it's the wind say, yeah. You guys because when you were trying to throw alcohol down my throat and gone, I realize it's the same reason why I can't I don't really enjoy giving head because your guy because of my gag reflexes are just isn't so bad or good they got I don't know when you've got a gag reflex. Is that because this is what it's like when you can handle you can't you can't right exactly. That's the same reason why I well I'm sucking dick. It's not fun. It's not fun for me because I don't like things going down my throat that way. Oh shots in that because you know you guys Always like oh you just gotta let it hit the back of your throat. I can't actually do it. Yeah, I mean so I don't taste shots. That's what I'm saying. I can't do that. So you want to be able to eat it was it muscles to say us? Me too. So that's I like fish yet. Careful Dickie. Yeah. Oh, yeah, he should be that used to be like my least favorite song of has and then it became one of my favorite songs was it was some songs like this is a shit. Yeah. I can feel it. Worse. Destiny's Child song is girl. Make five million. I just find it cringe. I'm sorry. If you think I'm going to be in the beach when I was younger, like wishing you the best pray that you are blessed with happiness greater than that. I'm not gonna bring it. I'm back. Laughing go as well darts, then you need yellow profit. I know that video camera. We press pause night Max to get changed and go again and proposed that changed last song. That was that song Big video question was if I were a boy for me. Oh, I really hate that song. I hate that song so, you know somebody hey, He said yes to your number. I love this is crazy. Not it's still a good song. It's just my least favorite. See what's that song? Can I hit the middle? It's the sweetest in the middle night some Bama. That's the payoff of genome esophagus or cake at Moscow www.eurovisionzone.com. Nice that is a slut shaming sunlight, but then I still had the time of his that was when it was good to be a pick me. Yeah. Yeah, you know, I mean like that's when everyone was a pick me. Yeah, very underrated Cleese can love her love me some Kelis. I lost true also, not own the rights of jewelry. I have heard is underrated. That's Lisa's very basic which has been reading my time quote unquote underrated is because clearly said I'm not doing this shit anymore. I'm going to be the chef. Yeah. Yeah. Millionaire is one of my all-time favorite songs. Yeah Bruno Mars way that some you know, there was nothing on that she wrote that was not milkshake because I know that's what your business does number one about like. Oh, I hate you so much right now. Yes bang on my tree wants Me twice. No. Yeah, but album The Shining sexy there's yeah very yeah. Yeah. Yeah. She just doesn't make music just as I want to I don't stop sits and she does it. It's like really obscure. She doesn't even want everyone to hear. I don't think she believes that climate is that actually live in life what I was thinking about this the other day, you know, what's more important the producer or the songwriter? I don't know I think both because to me when the nation are you sure it's the producer because that's the beat. I think it's a combination of depends on the kind of Thing you're making it to some songs. I just a funky beat. Oh, but actual production of a song. I can't think of Sierra yummy in my tummy. That's really amazingly produced. I thought you could you could put any lyrics in there. Okay, that's a perfect example that options, okay. That's an amazing honor. What about the limits but is it because of the well known at the time as not an option. Yeah, but if they make money online in that Melody, but you weren't saying those words. It was still bang so you could be saying I go to the shops to buy milk. That song I feel like even if it was a shit song. It was still banging be banging to you. It's a perfectly I think the surface it depends on. Yeah, but you're right at traffic. It's both. Yeah. It depends that for example slow jam. I don't be apartment to do that interlude and the best insulator is didn't didn't didn't the sentence that the defendant know. No hit the gym is a great insulator. You Got It Bad guitar. Yes it is. This is what he's some everybody seems to think he can sing it but nobody can sing it because I love Whitney Houston saving on my love and it into these for that one is more shit remember on time but like institution slow jams. Yeah. Ultimately. It's the words. Yeah. Yeah. Because something like the words the song to song that's lap three Cindy on last night's not insane. We and I supposed to be unbeatable. Don't you think he's mad that she her husband. I mean rest in peace and everything but like he was a piece that was a bit PD a bit. She met him when she was like 10. Yeah. It was when he married her when she was at 19 and he was like in his 40s now that is why that is but no one judged it. Well, she said you've been my inspiration through the lies you were the truth. My world is a better. Better place because right now I don't know who wrote it. But you know, it's more like growing up you'd think OK. Yeah that person you didn't know anything about gross, right? You know, you didn't know anybody like I didn't care contributing to the song and I think we ship I know but we know too much this is the problem. You're I always say that we know too much. I don't care like I'm not interested. Those are getting paid. I just I mean like my thing is I would love to work with I think yeah. Everyone hates Justin Timberlake now, but we still love him back in the day. I didn't want he's done by papacy. Haven't we such as what he's done? Because I don't want to hate him. Yeah everyone like, I'm not going to hate everyone. Well, okay. I'll tell you I'll tell you everyone calls him a culturally appropriate now, but at the time at the time of the banging Justified we do we went think there was a time in my life. Nobody could tell me. Yeah exactly. But it was very purposeful because even whose pink was saying that they the better as well like when she came out. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, but she's like non-black in some way. But she deny me this whole time. She's just called Alicia way and she just a white woman. Yeah. She went really well. Why is she told me yeah. Yes, she looks quite like opening our saying that yeah, that's what they wanted to do. Like she's not gonna be she's a good way in which it's like the dad didn't help that all of this. Not just take it on my love. Track that's come out Morgan that I sit here and be like a Grime and yeah, so tell me about you know what we were in for a couple more minutes because it was uncomfortable to listen to what I wanted move. It was a working woman. I want to meander then the The guys came to your door cause they wanted War the next day Heathrow Terminal four. It because they broke everything down by - going to yeah, listen to how fast they break everything down from the beginning. So now I can understand a bit more and I guess the whole thing started with the idea of homage and this is where this whole thing is conversation out like yeah, exactly. And that's where this whole thing is kind of come from. So what do you guys think about it before we get into that? Yeah. Do you know do you know how funny it was when that American tweeted who is Storm z and y is his Willy grunting actually America one with people at the airport You got a terminal so then she went to the terminal. It's got the finest. No, you don't know. I was joking. Yeah paying homage. So that's where it seems like this whole thing is stems from so like I think the first for receiving homage is allowing a lot of Legends to go outside. I totally agree and this is not new scene happens if you behave when Nicki Minaj came out your new must like she didn't pay me enough how much Wonder there's an interview for Nicki Minaj wrong and giving I'm leaving. Everybody's there when card to be came out Nicki Minaj and I still pay me homage and I'm pretty sure Nicki Minaj has said good things about I mean cardia said the things like Nicki Minaj in the past. Yeah consistently people like pay me how much I pay my homage. I'm not really a fan of homage or anything like that was carrying or giving very I'm not receiving it. I don't care about this evening. I don't care. It's even I have never been the kind of I would never sit here and be like, it was me before me I I'm the one I'm the leader. You should know you're not no one is nasty, but I'm very aware that anything I've been allowed to do. Somebody had to do something else in order for me to allow for me. Yeah, so I am not the leader of any fucking thing. But like there's not one thing. I promise you there's nothing in this life that I've done. That was just me that yeah, even if it was the smallest somebody had to apply for this job in order for me to be able to say this. Yeah, a black woman summer has to be on television with me to say this Jesus. Upon how to host a TV show and China forward a little bit to work in the media like so many things have to be done things with them before I was even thought about exactly before I come back maybe two things have to happen. Literally. No, I was given a chance to do anything that I'm doing now. I will never neglect that I will never do anything about that, but sorry is nobody before me but I didn't mention me that interview on this arm and this is because of that shit, you know, I totally totally agree with you. I think that people are so obsessed with the idea of being credited for things like Because to me now when I honestly like now luckily your Kim's doing some work to kind of like be tracked all of that shit, but honestly, if she wasn't I would just see her as a bitter old record that was generous and that's what you look like and it's sad because you should go out as the Legends as an innovator. I feel like if you know that you are an innovator of something like you saying told him no one nothing Under the Sun is knew you didn't create shit. And I mean someone had to have done something for you to be in the position to be able to do what you'll do for even if you did invent something and then someone else has copied. It's I don't need that kind of gratification for me to feel content. Like for me. Just knowing that I've done it is enough. He's right. I mean like for me as a bonus like say another podcast came and they were called the taxes and there's three girls wanted to you know, one guy in and one Nigerian and they were talking about the same things we did and it's obvious that like, they might have been inspired by us. I don't need you to come I don't need I don't need the home. He's like, please let me know if you want to I think it's a nice bonus, you know, I mean, like if people choose to be like hard to know what I started here and I was inspired by this amazing, but it's not I think that I need so I for me like when people like getting into beefs over it because of they haven't they feel like they haven't been given their due respect or they haven't been giving their quote unquote homage. I just find it really cringe because all it says to me is that you're jealous and you're bitter and you don't want to see the movement and they evolve and and also I'm not sitting there every single interview watching the whole thing waiting to see say anything about and I'm not saying it. What is the truth? What did you expect? What is it like Because they I don't recall that even when the receipts have been put in front of Lil Kim. She still won't acknowledge. Yeah, you know, I mean people have said it you still don't acknowledge it so it's like what more can I do and it gets to a point where I'm not going to keep on kissing your ass, especially when you have done it because they'll Rush right into me, but I know you have done it, but because you chose not to you chose to ignore the times I have said it's not good enough for you. Well, the platform is not big enough. I feel like I'm sorry, whether it's a small platform or a big puffer. I've said it I said it and don't think just because you have said that I haven't said it enough that I'm going to now say even more I'm going to now that's not no that's gonna make me want to not exactly because I'd rather just not say anything. It's never good enough for you, especially in the world of hip-hop or Grime over every hip-hop gram of thinking ideas needs to say that the king of it. Yeah cannot be a vampire grandma is the winter and not believe in your heart that you are the best. There's probably about six to eight lepers that Then on the king of hip-hop and yes, yeah in the world. Yeah, I'm decreasing size king of R&B. Yeah, he's still selling of his chair by Nature what it is. That's what you're meant to be cocky with it. Like this is especially when it's music and Hip-Hop. I have many things like that. Yeah and the best part. Yeah, why are you doing if you don't forget about this thing is why you doing is literally a sport isn't it? But like with Jack we share let's get so mad at him for saying it and he still said with his chest. Okay, what if you're not the best so I think I'm the best. Yeah, why are you doing something? If you don't think my impact there was nothing. I promise you. I'll put my hand down. There's nothing that's what I'm gonna do if my impact in put it on I'm not doing it. Do you think it's wrong though that people never select say for example, someone like trapeze. He's calling himself a king of R&B. I don't think he's wrong for doing that. But do you think that like do you think that homage kind of has to be like do you think it's ever I needed? In any circumstance, I think it's important and I think it's need to I think it's important. It's nice isn't it to appreciate people? Yeah things. Yeah. I'm taking a knowledge them. But where do you say these things then whenever you want a fucking want to do whatever you want to whatever comes to your head and you won't have to do asking me about my journey and I'm gonna be talking about someone from the past. It's like I feel like I do just choose. But ultimate is because you want people to know that you did it. That's what it is. You know, I mean so they might be like I walk if I gave you this platform to go public then don't thank me in private. I mean, I think it's ridiculous. But that's how and that means you're doing it for the wrong reasons because I know I know like so I know someone and they were like are they were dming someone he's at celebrity and that's what they were doing is they were posting up someone's work consistently. That's like famous. Yeah, and they were like are always posting am always posting it but they're like kind of related to this person. Yeah, and then they were like Hajj. No, I'm going to stop fucking posted it because Wonder she never ever be post my stuff and she never ever said thank you for Miri Pope for posting her stuff. And then I just said well then that means that you doing it. You're not doing it for genuine reason. It didn't you're not doing it actually genuinely support this person you're doing it because you want recognition that you've done it. Yeah. So to me, like just don't do it then. Yeah, I don't understand why you need homage, right? If a men and I'm aware that I have two options when someone new comes along. Yeah. Shut the fuck up. Behind you. Yeah. Yeah, I don't do it but it's I'm doing people know that my name is inadmissible in the history books on my only Italy. That's it. Yes still dusty, but I'm begging for the hundred you're not there anymore to if I like what they're doing you disposed time because for me it's sick. It makes me feel like oh I'm scared. Now that my position may be taken away your threatens, but do you think though when you're you know what you were just saying about you cosign that person if you genuinely like that. Yeah, do you think that Times like the reason people don't want to do that is because it's like it's taking the shine away from them, but it's not like they might feel popular late night cement enough in what you build. That you've put in all the you've sacrificed again. Nothing Under the Sun but did I ask you to knowledge that you sacrifice shit like you've created stuff and you've paved the way because a lot of the times that we're not we don't see the people that have paved the way no, I mean but so that Grime is still quite new still a baby tonight mean in the history book. So someone like widely that's paved the way he slugged his guts out for years to create what it is now and people are coming a lot and I'm not saying storms he's doing so I'm just I'm just talking and People have come along and they're not acknowledging your hard work like imagine like but has not acknowledged him at all. Right? It's 10,000 he has exactly so that's what we're you're saying. How many times does he need to be acknowledged? Imagine you write a ten thousand word essay. And it's Lynn. It's got all these amazing points and then then but people are taking it for their work and then they're not quitting Janome. The pleasure is different, but wouldn't you be annoyed though? No. No, it's like you had a ten thousand word essay does change the laws or when it and because of your essay people can now Cautiously. Yeah, I'll be I'm smart enough to be like, that's my legacy. Yeah, what like people I want to C be smart enough to my my legacy is that because of the that's just my story. I had to be the one to go after this. I had to be the one maybe that wasn't here in the amazing thing for your amazing money. But my legacy is that without me this wouldn't have been springboarded and that's enough Jim nice to know that she means nothing because clearly it's not enough for some people for some people like for you which ones who pay you Monroe before you let the legacy is I would rather that, you know, the legacy is a nonprofit that people they want a physical gratification to know. I just don't like wise if it's properly that's what it is. Yeah Publix is they want some yeah that everyone can they want to be held up on a pedal stool. Literally they want to be held up on a pedestal we wanted to be what is that relevantly from the bondage? Yeah. Everyone's gonna do that. So you might as well for yourself from that bondage because people aren't always going to be able to do it and why don't I pour some pee has you weren't that inspiration? Yeah. Someone that came off to you. You went inside. Yeah, but Sofia I thought you do it too, but it wasn't you. Yeah true. So watch now imagine someone that's cold. But like yeah, I'm so excited about pain because the rich and I think that's what was he Wiley and about 120 think that's what happens now a lot especially with these rappers, especially with that, you know, like the young rappers of getting so much stick with they don't pay because they don't say that Biggie or Tupac was their favorite red park if it wasn't there is that it was Buddy Rich. He recently said in an interview, If you like these I you old niggas want me to say Biggie and Tupac. I wasn't even born when they were popping and Drake and Future of The Inspirations because these guys are like what 1918 and Drake is things to be features like 35. That's of course get rustic. That's what you that inspiration is gonna be my first people say Biggie and Tupac, but then it's that whole thing would be a but you should know your history. You should know where everything seems like we don't know the history of where everything fucking stems. Well, no, I didn't say he was the first person to do you want, you know, I mean, but just gave yourself but I also think it's that thing of people what their flowers in it because I believe got him flowers. I believe when people die then we want to turn around a bit. I'll call you with a great shoot and it's like does this person have to die for us to acknowledge what I believe in keeping people their flowers. I think even if I wasn't paying homage are and like seeking homage away. Yeah, they're different. It's almost gone with their flowers give it to me. Like I think what you're doing is sick, that's enough for me. Yeah. Yeah, you have to mention my Name in every interview where you don't need to do that like a war chose like they do like a tribute someone that still alive or whatever. Yeah, you know some people yeah, you know this person in my life that they want you to say that I think the people that are seeking it so desperate. Wait night ends up because that face. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, literally that you're doing everything that you did was for feifei McLeod like yeah, you know, you actually wanted to pay but you can't because I need hip hop that they're happy in their house. Imagine being so secure and what you do that you'd actually your content. What happens do they live in they've got their money or whatever and they can tip but not everybody is like I think like for me I would be content with my like my house is my homage. Yeah, I mean like the fact that my family is up. That's my homage, but for some people they want they want to hear say because they truly believe that you they made, you know, you're not that's mental. You know that you're fully but they're really not my God and I think you have to let it go because you'll drive yourself insane because look at the Wily and storms in situation. For instance. You're the one that Saying oh, yeah, I need you need to pay some homage to muted and somebody beats you at your own craft. Exactly. Now your now you look around now you this is the thing.

Rivals tonight means I win you do plenty become go and you become bigger than them. Now all of a sudden it's a problem. But when I was trying you don't want to know what is that person wrong for like they don't know, you know, they're not wrong what my it just falls down stairs. Honestly go away. Just go away. Yeah be happy in your legacy. My might just know that I've done this laughing. They're like the same people that girls are talking about me enough, and I know what I've done. Something to me and I was like, yeah, man, I went back to me. I don't believe anyone self-made. I don't like nope. I don't believe me. I did think that you put a lot of work into yourself you do a lot of things but I don't necessarily even Emotional Self Made because I feel like in order to what they want to do something slow. Do it yourself want to go far go people. That's not the same but it's the same kind of like notion sort of things. I guess. I'm a quick hard to people so but I just think the whole like it just makes let us go outside. Yeah, that was part of because now we don't remember now you want and that offer you now cause you're fighting with your thumbs literally and all of that hard work that you put into that. It's for shit. That's the last thing people are and that takes a lot to the guys. Chipmunk, I do love it a chipmunk has felt the need to get back to is Chipmunks when he was beaten with tiny.

Now it's time to go back. To our bedtime reading. Hi everyone. My name is Amber Lawton and you are listening to Bible at bedtime a podcast where I read the Bible to help you fall asleep. The reason I decided to start this podcast is because over the years. I've had trouble falling asleep, and I discovered that I enjoy listening to the Bible. But I find some narration to be difficult to follow when trying to fall asleep. So here tonight. I'm going to read our first selection. I decided to start with a dreamer Joseph and for tonight. This will be part one reading Genesis chapter 37 through chapter 40. So before we get started go ahead and lay down. Finding a comfortable position. Take a deep breath in. And then out. And as you breathe exhaling the stress of your day and letting your focus be on peaceful sleep as you hear the word now Genesis 37 Joseph's dreams. Jacob lived in the land where his father had stayed the land of Canaan. These are the family records of Jacob. I 17 years of age Joseph tended sheep with his brothers. The young man was working with the sons of bilhah and zilpah his father's wives and he brought a bad report about them to their father. Now Israel loved Joseph more than his other Sons because Joseph was a son born to him in his old age and he made a robe of Many Colors for him. When his brothers saw that their father loved him more than all his brothers. They hated him and could not bring themselves to speak peaceably to him then Joseph had a dream. When he told it to his brothers, they hated him even more. He said to them listen to this dream. I had there we were binding sheaves of grain in the field. Suddenly my Sheaf stood up and your sheaves gathered around it and bow down to my Sheaf. Are you really going to Reign Over Us. His brothers asked him. Are you really going to rule us? So they hated him even more because of his dream and what he had said. Then he had another dream and told it to his brothers. Look he said I had another dream and this time the sun moon and Eleven stars were bowing down to me. He told his father and brothers and his father rebuked him. What kind of dream is this that you have had he said am I and your mother and your brothers really going to come and bow down to the ground before you? His brothers were jealous of him, but his father kept the matter in mind Joseph sold into slavery. His brothers had gone to pasture their fathers flocks at shechem. Israel said to Joseph your brother's, you know are pastoring the flocks at shechem. Get ready. I'm sending you to them. I'm ready Joseph replied. Then Israel said to him go and see how your brothers and the flocks are doing and bring word back to me. So he sent him from the Hebron Valley and he went to shechem. A man found him there wandering in the field and asked him. What are you looking for? I'm looking for my brothers. Joseph said can you tell me where they are pastoring their flocks? They've moved on from here. The man said I heard them say let's go to Jonathan. So Joseph set out after his brothers and found them at tothen. They saw him in the distance and before he had reached them. They plotted to kill him. They said to one another. Oh, look here comes that dream expert so now come on. Let's kill him and throw him into one of the pits. We can say that a vicious animal ate him then we'll see what becomes of his dreams. When Ruben heard this he tried to save him from them. He said let's not take his life. Rubin also said to them don't shed blood throw him into this pit in the wilderness, but don't lay a hand on him. Intending to rescue him from them and return him to his father. When Joseph came to his brothers, they stripped off Joseph's robe the robe of Many Colors that he had on then they took him and threw him into the pit. The pit was empty without water. They sat down to eat a meal and when they looked up there was a caravan of Ishmael lights coming from Gilead. Their camels were carrying aromatic gum Balsam and resin going down to Egypt. Judah said to his brothers. What do we gain if we kill our brother and cover up his blood? Come on, let's sell him to the ishmaelites and not lay a hand on him for he is our brother our own flesh and his brothers agreed. When many a night Traders passed by his brothers pulled Joseph out of the pit and sold him for twenty pieces of silver to the ishmaelites who took Joseph to Egypt. When Ruben return to the pit and saw that Joseph was not there. He tore his clothes. He went back to his brothers and said the boy is gone. What am I going to do? So they took Joseph's robe slaughtered and they'll go and dipped the robe in its blood. They sent the robe of Many Colors to their father and said we found this examine it is it your son's robe or not. His father recognized it. It is my son's robe. He said a vicious animal has devoured him. Joseph has been Torn to Pieces then Jacob tore his clothes put sackcloth around his waist and mourn for his son many days. All his sons and daughters tried to comfort him, but he refused to be comforted. No, he said I will go down to Shield to my son morning and his father wept for him. Meanwhile, the midianites sold Joseph in Egypt to potiphar and officer of pharaoh and the captain of the guards. chapter 39 Joseph in Potiphar's house Now Joseph had been taken to Egypt and Egyptian named potiphar and officer of pharaoh and the captain of the guards bought him from the ishmaelites who had brought him there. The Lord was with Joseph and he became a successful man serving in the household of his Egyptian master. When his master saw that the Lord was with him and that the Lord made everything. He did successful Joseph found favor with his master and became his personal attendant. Potiphar also put him in charge of his household and placed all that. He owned under his authority. From the time that he put him in charge of this household and all that. He owned the Lord blessed the Egyptians house because of Joseph. The Lord's blessing was on all that. He owned in his house and in his Fields, he left all that. He owned under Joseph's Authority. He did not concern himself with anything except the food he ate. Now Joseph was well-built and handsome after some time. His master's wife looked longingly at Joseph and said sleep with me, but he refused look he said to his master's wife with me here. My master does not concern himself with anything in his house. And he has put all that he owns under my authority. No one in this house is greater than I am. He has withheld nothing from me except you because you are his wife. So, how could I do this immense evil? And how could I sin against God although she spoke to Joseph day after day he refused to go to bed with her. Now one day he went into the house to do his work. And none of the household servants were there. She grabbed him by his garment and said sleep with me. But leaving His Garment in her hand, he escaped and ran outside. When she saw that he had left His Garment with her and had run outside. She called her household servants. Look she said to them my husband brought a Hebrew man to make fools of us. He came to me so he could sleep with me and I screamed as loud as I could. When he heard me screaming for help, he left his garment beside me and ran outside. She put Joseph's garment beside her until his master came home. Then she told him the same story. The Hebrew slave you brought to us came to make a fool of me. But when I screamed for help, he left his garment beside me and ran outside. When his master heard the story his wife told him. These are the things your slave did to me. He was Furious and had him thrown into prison where the Kings prisoners were confined. So Joseph was there in prison Joseph in prison But the Lord was with Joseph and extended kindness to him. He granted him favor with the prison Warden the warden put all the prisoners. Who are in prison under Joseph's Authority and he was responsible for everything that was done there. The warden did not bother with anything under Joseph's Authority because the Lord was with him and the Lord made everything that he did successful. chapter 40 Joseph interprets to prisoners dreams After this the king of Egypt's cupbearer and Baker offended their Master the king of Egypt Pharaoh was angry with his two officers the chief cupbearer and the chief Baker and put them in custody in the house of the captain of the guards in the prison where Joseph was confined. The captain of the guards assigned Joseph to them as their personal attendant and they were in custody for some time the king of Egypt's cupbearer and Baker who were confined in the prison. each had a dream both had a dream on the same night and each dream had its own meaning. When Joseph came to them in the morning, he saw that they looked distraught. So he asked pharaohs officers who were in custody with him and his master's house. Why do you look so sad today? We had dreams they said to him but there is no one to interpret them. Then Joseph said to them don't interpretations belong to God. Tell me your dreams. So the chief cupbearer told his dream to Joseph in my dream. There was a Vine in front of me on the vine were three branches as soon as it budded it blossoms come out and it clusters ripened into grapes. Pharaoh's cup was in my hand and I took the grapes squeeze them into Pharaoh's cup and place the cup in Pharaoh's hand. This is its interpretation. Joseph said to him the three branches are three days in just three days Pharaoh will lift up your head and restore you to your position. You will put Pharaoh's Cup in his hand the way you used to when you are his cupbearer. But when all goes well for you remember that I was with you. Please show kindness to me by mentioning me to pharaoh and get me out of this prison for I was kidnapped from the land of the Hebrews and even here I have done nothing that they should put me in the dungeon. When the chief Baker saw that the interpretation was positive. He said to Joseph. I also had a dream three baskets of white bread were on my head in the top basket were all sorts of baked goods for Pharaoh, but the birds were eating them out of the baskets on my head. This is its interpretation. Joseph replied the three baskets are three days in just three days Pharaoh will lift up your head from off you and hang you on a tree. Then the birds will eat the flesh from your body. On the third day, which was Pharaoh's birthday. He gave A Feast for all his servants. He elevated the chief cupbearer and the chief Baker among his servants Pharaoh restore the chief cupbearer to his position as cupbearer and he placed the cup in Pharaoh's hand. But Pharaoh hang to the chief Baker just as Joseph had explained to them. Yet the chief cupbearer did not remember Joseph he forgot him. That's it for tonight's reading. Hopefully you have fallen asleep tomorrow. We will continue. with chapter 41 sleep well tonight. And rest knowing that the Lord is with you. Good night.","– It's not every day that a podcast called ""Bible at bedtime"" goes viral, but that's exactly what happened this week. The popular podcast by Amber Lawton, who says she enjoys listening to the Bible to help her fall asleep, got a lot of attention this week after Lawton shared a dream dreamed up by 17-year-old Joseph. In the dream, Joseph says he was working with his brothers on a sheep farm when he had a dream. ""Suddenly my Sheaf stood up and your sheaves gathered around it and bow down to my Sheaf,"" he says. ""Are you really going to rule us? So they hated him even more because of his dream and what he had said."" The brothers then stripped off Joseph's robe, threw him into a pit, and ate a meal when a caravan of lights came from Ishmael's field. Lawton posted the dream on her Facebook page Tuesday, and it's been shared more than 5,600 times. ""This is a dream. This is a story. This is what the Bible says,"" she writes. ""It's not a hoax. It's real. And it's important. And it's true. And it's good. And it's true.""",0.17692307692307693,0.0846153846153846

I got to take a second to talk to you a little bit more about anchor. I know you hear me talk about it all the time. I know I talked about it during every show but I have to tell you why it is the best and the easiest way out there to make a podcast when we wanted to do apples to apples again. We wanted to get it back out to the orchard. Anchor was the only way that we knew we could do it and let me explain to you why it's so simple first off it's free. I don't need to say anything more. It's free. You record. You get it out there it. Costs you nothing. It's that easy and how do you do it anchor has tons and tons of tools that allow you to record and edit your podcast yourself right from your phone or computer. All you need to do is get a phone or get a computer or get a friend or get it all it doesn't matter you record you added all in one place. And then how do you get it onto your orchard? Anchor handles that for you, too. They'll distribute the podcast for you. So you can hear it out on Spotify on Apple podcast and so many more streaming. I know I said it's free, but what's better than not paying anything getting paid to do your podcast. They're the ones that are going to set you up with sponsors, and there's no minimum listenership. If you get anybody to listen and you have a sponsor you're getting paid. It's that easy. They have everything you need to make a podcast all in one simple and easy place either from your phone or from your computer the next time you head to Anchor to listen to Apples to Apples either make an account or download the free anchor app or go to Anchor dot f m-- to get started and Start your podcast today now back to the show. Ladies and gentlemen, as it drew the music sounds good. Can you hear me testing one two? Why don't I am I coming through? Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Okay. So why don't you start like normal like you thought that was the plan? Yeah, that's that's where I was going. Oh, you were starting? Yeah. No that was it. Oh wowee. I'll be replayed the music and tested it like seven different times. And then I said, okay, this is the one and then I played the music. So we're actually on the air after two years right now. I don't think it's quite two years, but ya know I would ever open however long it's been we were on the air after that long and you managed to screw up. No. No, I don't. Like to do that, let's back up you start over I will be quiet and then I will do my thing and I even made sure and go Sam was there to babysit you over there? Oh here we are not introducing him yet. He's I'm not either I wasn't even planning or do see him. He's there solely in order to make sure you don't screw things up and it just it while clearly didn't work. I'm a little rusty in a little older than I was but go you go. All right there. Okay. Well right now there's no doubt you're older than you were Rusty. Well, I guess we'll find out but go ahead. Go ahead. We've got a lot to get you ready cannot I? It's like you actually want to play the music. I don't know if you want to play the music. No. No, where do you want to you? Are you are I'm gonna leave it up to you used to be much more professional you would have said if we did this wrong, we're going to start it over. We're going to get it right but I guess the news again. No, you're right. Play it again. I'll be right here. Are you sure and seeing go here we go. Ready? Are you actually ready this time? Because I can cut that stuff out. Nope. No, I don't know how well well do it. We need to be true to our Orchard and true too many new fans were going to It and we don't we don't take me don't take to we just go so that was my mistake. Apparently we are this is like this is a pretty big deal. I'm gonna have to cut all that stuff out I have to do without the guy that makes this show happen. We're gonna get to him in a little bit that's on my list of things to talk about so don't know it's good for so it's just like old times sake I'm talking about the things in your list before you get the correct you're interrupting me. So maybe we should keep going because it is kind of want to just keep going though. Well because it sounds like we're kind of right back in line up the music. Look at do your opening. And then I'll get to what's on today's show or yesterday's depending on your listing. But go ahead you go you go. Ladies and gentlemen, I don't know how long it's been it might have been almost two years. I don't think quite two years, but we're pushing two years probably at this point Apples to Apples is back by popular demand or semi popular demand or maybe just by a few people that asked us to do this one more time, but we are back and that's all that matters. As always. I am happy to be back. I am one half but today one third of the co-hosting trio of apples apples. I'm Drew Applebaum. I am coming to you live. Can I call it the same name? I don't have to drop the sponsor for now. No, no. No, we're starting a fresh look sponsor list. Is it okay for me to talk right now now you can talk I guess. Yeah, we don't have any we're sponsor list right now except for if you know anybody except for anchor Dot-com which we'll get to in a little bit. I think it's not commenting. It's dot f m so maybe maybe I'll do the do the rebs awkward. Okay, you know those people but oh, yeah, but yeah you go ahead you should have but we are back all joking aside. We are back happy to be back as always. Like I said, I'm drop a bomb. This is the Apples to Apples father-son podcast. This isn't going to be a full episode today. It's a bit of a teaser a bit of a trail or whatever you want to call it. We just wanted to announce that we are back and get this out there so we can get to your favorite pie. Cast app like my dad mentioned we're doing this with the help of anchor dot f m it is a sweet website that lets you do this super easily. If you've ever thought about starting a podcast go there. It's really easy you record right there doing your phone computer. It doesn't matter. Why would you tell other people to start their own podcast because other people would definitely be better at this than us and I was like listen to them. I would I would like to listen if there's a lot of people out there good things to say. I got a lot of stuff to talk about. I know you do. I know you do. Do but you can find us on anchor you can go to Anchor dot f m-- and then search Apples to Apples. I hope I got the right action and tried it but we're going to send the link go to our we know if you follow us on Twitter, which you all should at Apples to Apples PC, or you can go like us on Facebook Apples to Apples. It's the number two you'll be able to find us there. But with that said in a very very, oh are you gonna explain what happens after anchor gets it? Yes, that's exactly what I was. Oh that were you were in the okay. Sorry. Yes, go ahead. Oh my gosh. Yeah. I'm not sure I really want to do this again. I've Wyatt no Wise Wise we'll talk about him later. Go ahead. You can find us on anchor you'll find the Link on our Facebook and on our Twitter, but after that what this is going to do it so cool is you're gonna be able to go and get it anywhere you want you can go to iTunes. I guess. It's Apple music now, that's a long it's been since we've done it. It's Apple. It's the name changed. It used to be I tonight know dapple music. They got they actually shut down straight up shut down iTunes weird. Yeah, there's no way you knew that. So I did not I didn't even like barely was learning about iTunes, but go ahead right. I know I knew that but you're gonna go I'm almost called iTunes. That's how long it's been negative an apple music or apple podcast the Apple podcast app. If you're an iPhone person you're going to go to Google podcast if you're not an iPhone person for that's where I go. I go to Google or I could also go here. If you are a Spotify user you see I have a Spotify and I don't have commercials anymore. Once the family told me that we were at a family plan. So I could listen to you guys conveniently left me off of but it's okay. I'm not that was enough dough for two years at all because it's okay. I'm not that upset about I'm still paying for it myself, but that's fine. That's fine. But Apple podcast think we're still podcast cell phone bill. So I think we're even I actually had a conversation maybe not with Mom with myself and the internet. Well, how'd that go taking myself off with it? I had a good conversation with myself. We decided it wasn't the best move at this point, but we thought about it. I figured okay good apple podcast Google podcasts or Spotify. You can find us on any of those three. It's going to Take a little bit to get up there which is why we're doing this first initial kind of teaser episode so we can get it out there get it distributed and then all of you can listen to it to wherever is most convenient, but like I said follow us on Twitter at Apples to Apples PC and you'll always know when there's a new episode but you really should subscribe on one of those three. You can also follow us on Facebook like us on Facebook I should say and like I said, it's always on anchor you can find us there. That is our new home base. All right P to the alive and social network. It was a good run. We needed a bit of a hiatus. Has a little bit of a break had to re regroup a little bit, but we're back and maybe better than ever. Let's be honest. They ran away from us. I they wanted no part of us, which I understand that I do get him. It was getting ugly but go ahead. No, I think that's it. Like I said anchor dot f m is the website. That's the that's our new home base. Like I said, you can find us there. No, I'm going to recap one more time. This is important on people be able to know where to find us on our new home. Yeah. Anchor dot f m it delink actions anchor dot f m / Drew - Applebaum if you want to know for sure way to include the rest of us because yeah, listen, I made it God knows you weren't figuring that out. You've made it while you're in New York. Of course, if you can make it there, you can make it anywhere Concrete Jungle where dreams are made of that's Alicia not Fox. He's a wrestler. That's Alicia Keys. Right. Yes, it is. That's you're going to go to find us on anchor but like I said Google podcast Apple podcast Spotify subscribe there you won't have to worry about it. But thanks for listening and thanks for coming back for those that ask for us to come back. You know, we're flattered. We're not really sure why but we're here and with that I will throw it from the it's been a while now. They're just the apple cider seller Studios. I will throw it. We got to come up with the orchard stay in the same. We got it's always the orchard Studios. Well, I think mine's still the apple cider sellers. I got I'm in a brand-new Studio you are yours needs in game number six. Maybe the name for maybe the Orchard and the new Orchard members can help get some numbers. Well, I think we're going to get I'm going to get to that we've got some shout outs and I think we're going to bring in some new listeners. I'm going to formally throw it. Okay, I'll figure York New York in the apple cider seller Studios to an undisclosed location in the Greater Twin Cities area because I'll leave that to you. You know what I'm going to say. It, Mendota Heights, Minnesota. That's pretty small to you really? Like people could find you. We lost that pretty easily. If you have that it we're staring out the window right now. So and he let me back up a second. Excuse me. I'm going to throw it to my state champion co-host. Yeah. Well, we're going to get state champion co-host in Mendota Heights Minnesota the second third for today the second half on most days of the co-hosting group. Duo/trio. Whatever it is on any given day. My dad Scott Applebaum if that is still your name out you've gone. Well, that's that's not my real name. That's my podcast name. That's my stage name why you've gone through a bit of a crisis in the meantime. I just want to make sure yeah when that's the name they gave me when I was at chunkin Dale's for a little bit. We'll get to our third guest because he you know, if this tryout chunkin Dale's yeah, I work for chunkin Dale's but it's like Chippendales. But let's like the Chris Farley version ship and yeah, and I really don't want to get into that because now I'm now that I don't have to do that anymore. Now that we're back in the podcast. Oh, yeah. Yeah, so I had gotta do it. You gotta do it. Make a dollar I get it. Yeah. Yeah, and it was weird because I did use brick house as my opening while listen what you know, then I close with We are family not I mean spoiler alert at the end of the show. You might hear that. We haven't really we're not going to lie very I have to buy that here too far. You don't have closing music yet. Well now while listen I got the rest of the should I make it out. Yeah, we're going to get to our third guest who's sort of on a he's been on before but this might be a trial because if He if it goes well, I mean we could do New York. So we got the East Coast we got the West Coast if it goes well and he went and he can do it from there. So we'd be bicoastal which as everyone knows we're very accepting of the LBG T QR s community and then me and the Midwest I'm in the mid west coast what I knew that's exactly you're going to say and I was kind of hoping you weren't actually going to say that but I was that bad. There were no it was just it was it was funny I guess. Oh, thank you. So I mean the mid west coast we if it works will have people will have each clothes covered all different time zones, but we'll see he's On a trial but on this very first return if it does well on episodes he joins will splice in California love maybe into the we're going to drip that we're going to get to why he might be on because I think we have a huge audience from his school that we're going to get to but not quite yet on today's return show. Yes, we do have a kdz episode. We'll see how that goes. If there's anyone that I'm I'm I'm confident still has it after all this time. It's her. Yeah, myself skeptical. You definitely don't have it start our third member that you still haven't actually formally introduced. We'll see I don't heard it's a fan but that's no down. Did I doubt I'd forgot to mute my mic when I said that um, But we will have ktz. However for those returning Orchard members wondering about Wyatt. He's I got some sad news yet. He is alive but shortly after our show concluded. He did need to go in the witness protection program and it's a shame for a number of reasons one with I miss him. I miss him too. One two, I had a lot of really good ideas for what we could do with this show and his expertise and wisdom and Equipment were needed to do that. And I just I'm not gonna be able to do Her well the things I thought of I was gonna I was gonna play the We Are Family Music and I was going to cut to the Undertaker music or the stone cold music. I haven't fully decided but I was going to cut to one of those I was going to try and find I had all these grandiose plans and then he I tried to contact them and I the FBI showed up at my door and said don't ever do that again. Well, we're working on getting him out because without Wyatt then of course, we don't have why it's Corona one-hit wonders of the week the Quran. Apart, we'd have to probably leave out and that was a huge part of that was probably one of my favorite parts of the show. So we're going to try to get over there were a number of people by a number and that number is like two that were like, well you still going to do the music thing and I was like, I maybe I'm probably not because we don't have why it but I have breaking news. From a lady named Sue Charlie Blackmon has the all-time worst baseball beard ever. She's not a big she is not a big athlete beard person if I know anything about her from you know, I have known her my whole life. I don't know if you know that she's not the same with her son. Well, she's known me my whole life that would make sense. It'd be weird if I knew her and she didn't know me, but if I've learned if I've learned a few things one of them is that she hates athletes with beards. She hates large beards, I think in general but I think athletes with beard specifically no-go for her. So I just wanted to get that out there since she felt the need to text me immediately this Not like no, she knows hundred for me. No, no, she's weird in an undisclosed part of the house. But anyways, so why we're working on Wyatt. Hopefully if the show lasts more than two or three, which I think it could we'll try to get him back in some respect so know why it yet, but we're working on it. You know, I'm hoping as we bring this show back. We'll hear it from some of our old friends doc. The doctor doctor goog. I'm sure at some point. Point I'll be chiming in remember the representative Stanford Stanford. Yes, what about why I'm hoping he Chimes back in he was a little nutty and some of our old friends. We got Sheamus Harvey some of our old friends were hoping but I think we're going to get some new friends and now is a better time than any to introduce our third member of the bicoastal again. We're very accepting Trio for now the be an lgbtq R stands for bicoastal. Yep bicoastal, right? He is wearing rainbow. He always does but that's beside the point. He's wearing his rainbow outfit. So once again Orchard and we'll get to why he's really on because of where he's going to school the one and only Sam no relation Applebaum Sam what he had to say for yourself for all the old listeners and especially the newest nursers. This is the voice of Sam. No relation Appelbaum and I am honored to be a part of the first show and I'm happy to take the show Coast-to-Coast. Hopefully if my tryout goes well and if the show goes well because I will not be going back for a few months, right? So yeah, we got to make it there. So we'll just be from the mid west coast for if sent with Sam for a while, and I'm not so happy that I'm being used. Just because I go to school on the west coast. So anyway, so Sam goes to college at Santa Clara University. Hold on. I have I have I have a question. Yeah, go ahead. I know it's been a while since I've since I've seen Sam. Yeah. Did you develop a lisp since I last saw, you know, it's a little weird because I'm hearing double with this new thing while he's doesn't mean you have to speak double and it's weird cause he's sitting on my lap, but I'm virtus train. So that's okay. So I'm just saying it just because you're hearing double doesn't mean any Double but that's because at that point I didn't want to call him out right away, but I'm glad you did so I knew he would probably punch you in the face. If you did I was looking at him like what you talking about Willis for those of you that are old enough to drink actually not anyways, it's gonna resign. Anyways, I digress Sam went and still goes to Santa Clara University. He's got a ton of friends that know he's got a ton of acquaintances there. I don't know if there's friends he dabbled in a little radio show with one of his roommates, but as a dishing it out the dish the dish man. And dishing it out. I'll Reserve comments and Dish and they did well, so I think we can either you know, how we used to have not used to we're going to do it again and we had our listeners chimed in with questions and comments. I think Sam's group. We very active on the old Twitter torquing machine. So it's working machine and the twerking is he being used partly. Yeah, do we feel sorry for him partly? I am I would say the majority majority happens. There's all tier. It's like 75 percent and fifty percent. So it's a it's a it's a it's a good it's a really good segue. I don't know if you noticed Segway is that but it's a good one. It's that the thing is I'd that to two wheels because you know, what are those up? You know, what are what are our Twitter handle is right now start working handle. I know you know what that is, but our Twitter handle is what at Apples to Apples PC follow us on Twitter everybody. We're very PC. I didn't actually mean that at the time just the Apples to Apples is already so I think it just adds something and I went with PC which is looking back on it. Not the best call but whatever so Samuel and Sam will be kind of on a summer tryout period Hopefully it goes a little bit better than his baseball career, but you never can all be winners like you. All right. Well now that we're on the topic we got I got a shout out that I have to give that's how you segue Drew. That's a segue. I thought that one was stinky ride. That's what I thought too. But so for those of you familiar and not familiar the st. Thomas Academy Cadet baseball team this year or last year for listening a year from now, but that would be untimely. one the stick Minnesota state championship in baseball I don't believe either one of you two did that when you played there, but I could be wrong now. I don't think Syrian. No objections Sam got the state. Not sure what your deal is Drew. But that's fine. It does. Listen. I'm only one guy through one not very good player on a on a bigger teams like the whole plan of the roots and then you blossomed. So whatever that I didn't do much so the shout out has to go to coach Matt Kelly head coach Matt Kelly assistant coach Brian Myers, you know Brian, I don't very well. Yeah, so do I so I actually know you probably taught him everything he knew now I second time. I did Coach Dylan Welter. You don't know Dylan very nice guy great coach. I don't and then the two last but not least coaching key. And for sure, not last but not least coach mono. So those big shout out to those guys matters and go I'm sorry and Coach nadders. They coaching staff. Sorry, coach nadders and then the entire team which I'm not going to list off but it's pretty crazy run got to play at Target Field beep benilde and won the state championship. So they're going to be chiming in to we're going to we might even have them on as a guest to talk to a state champion right now. There's no what it feels like Walden enough. Yeah one isn't enough right now. They're being sized. This is not a lie. They're being size for their championship rings. Cool. Yeah, very cool and is multi diamonds and sapphires and stuff like that. Oh my yeah. Yeah, that's pretty cool. I can't even well, I wouldn't know how but there's a picture that could be posted. Its you don't know how to do much so I know that's why I don't want to throw that out there. So huge shout out to coach Kelly and the boys. Coaches and players is pretty cool. And again, we'll talk about them a little further down the road. thoughts on on them. Yeah, you know, it's actually it's funny. I knew obviously follow the team. It's my alma mater. I'm very 132 that to I sort of know. I'm actually I'm very close with one coach and then I guess I know you too and I knew the championship game was going on and I randomly like founded somewhere online and literally watched the last two outs and it was pretty cool. I mean, it's the Correct me if I'm wrong the first time the history of the school two years ago. There was the first time they'd gone in 40 some years. We won the consolation championship. And this year is the first time they won the championship. That's and that's that's pretty cool. So I you know, congratulations to all those guys. It's no it's no simple feat to to do that. And I you know it I can only imagine how much fun it was and I'm sorry about breaking news. We'll get right back. Back to it. Apparently Charlie also has a mullet mom. Just I mean Sue just chimed in again. Oh, yeah. No the guy for the Rockies now. I know exactly just talking about I know that but anyways, if for those of you in town, July 18th, the team will be honored on the field before the Twins game at Target Field. That's awesome. Yeah, it's pretty fun. And then I think I don't know what else Sibley got a parade. I'm pretty sure st. Thomas well, but the man time to move on. Well, we just have to be a really long right? When you just have to be very long, but although you know with traffic it's going to be long anyway, so so anyways, so there's there's a little news now. What have we been doing the last couple of years? I don't think we're ain't getting any of that. Do I don't think anyone cares at all know we need to move on. I will say we're going to talk sports after kdz, which we're going to get to shortly. I will say, let's just briefly recap where I was Sports. Let's see Vikings when we last left. You were disappointment. Oh, yeah. Something probably won't make the playoffs this year. Second toughest schedule wild average at best disappointment bag goaltending and we're right back there again. Let's see Timberwolves. Don't I did I just say yeah Timberwolves. I mean, what do you say about them? Same thing? We couldn't really not say last time you're on the air. Now the twins at least they're trying the twins are trying they've also given up temples, but the twins to yeah, the twins, you know had a 13 14 game lead, that wasn't good enough, so We whittled it down to five and the ones they schedule in the major leagues in the second half. Well, that's good. They're going to need that the the interesting and the one cool thing about the twins. That although we I did profess that once we got rid of our we'd be better. So I wasn't totally wrong but the cool thing that the twins still do and it doesn't really matter who the general manager is. They still pretend like we're going to make big trades and sign big guys and then we don't so that's cool because they're still on that really sure what you wanted them to do. So like the trade deadline is in 20 date like they're But I want you to really confused in there were out there that we chose not to partake you guys from Houston. Oh my God, my battery's running on my computer. I battery what two guys from Houston Kimbrel and the keuchel stinks Kimbrel did play for Houston and Kimbrough has been crap since you know, but are seven relief pitchers are so good and Gibson see everyone so we have one very good one who Rogers? Yeah. Mr. Rogers. Okay, he can only p camp pitch a read-only your I said one and I'm not denying we needed and we need more. They do need more let's and when other one other relief pitchers start getting traded for and we're left in the outside. Then I will be on your side of this but we got like let them let them screw up before like they do have a five and a half game lead in the central in a season. We thought would all be we'd maybe at best sort of be in the Wild Card race. They have what is the number? What is the number one offense in baseball a lot of categories? They're a ton of fun to watch and I think they've spoiled us a little bit. Like you said, we had a we had a large lead. Having us an easy schedule at the Indian struggled a little bit. They've gotten a little bit back on track, but they had an easy schedule for a little bit while we had a difficult one. We have the easiest schedule in the second half of the Season, you know, I hope and like I said if they don't I will be right there with you thrashing them that I hope they make a move. It's they've had guys hurt. They've had guys hurt. I mean in their in their slight defense, but I think of nothing else to season so far has been a pleasant surprise and the only reason people are making a mistake right the only reason people You are getting so upset is because we were spoiled. For example, Houston Houston lost eight straight games. Nobody over there is panicking because of guess what I've kind of been there and guess what if they need a picture. They're gonna go get one if they need to get on TV. Aw. No, but they were stationed lately but no Sam no give him three weeks before you yell about them not doing anything. But listen, yeah, they could be too. Yeah. We're on the All-Star break right now Pakistan. My charger this isn't happening. Oh, here's Sam. If you're asking about me. I like Drew DQ Wonderwall because I for one thing that has changed in the past two years the Minnesota F you are on fire. I that's true a huge win last few days ago in Montreal third straight fifth straight to up to third in their cop who makes the playoffs by the way, we're talking soccer. For those of you uninformed without Drew. We thought wrong way. Yeah. I know I Actually watch soccer. It was on the road in Montreal so they could not play Wonderwall, but you know, there's still people there. Yeah, but you and I Dad we sang it we did I watched him in Montreal that's sad. But so that is one thing true soda has going for them. Well, that's a good point in these idiots when it's a hundred twenty degrees still wear their scarves. So I don't it's like a cult. I don't quite understand it. Yeah, well, it does help when there is no parking at the stadium and we need that so I don't know how you walk you through miles just to get there. All right, I'll give you the third a little bit. Well, they couldn't be any worse. It's only their what their third year isn't that a lot of soccer talk for the first show back. To be honest with you. This is going to become a soccer podcast. I'm all in on the lunita all in. Okay Wonderwall. I'm all in on the loans. I have to say it with a really deep English accent though. Then I just saying Wonder well while you're gone. Okay. Well, I'll see if I can maybe I can work that in somehow. Let's see how see what what anchor can do for us. I also managed to do to fix the URLs. Now. It's anchored on FM / apples - two - apples. Well, that's a relief right now. You have to see my name all the time. That's a huge relief. But ya know let's go arms up anything. I need before we're going to get the kdz. I think now this one I'm gonna give up. Oh, go ahead. No, I'm just gonna give you each a chance to you know, you know, there's anything been on your mind the last year and a half. To take years if you haven't really been able to chime in on. A lot but I make the people are gonna listen this probably heard me complain about it already. Anyway, well, I you don't know everyone that was I promise you if they didn't hear me talk about already and they don't want to so I got I you know, so it's been it's been a tough year and a half if there's one thing I've missed is kdz. Do you have mascara? She just texted me a picture of this basketball. Where were you playing bouncing out? There's no video here. I just looked at Sammy's got a Shiner. I thought he had mascara. Tell it talk to your buddy Andrew Johnson about that. I just saw him today. Mom Haiti was Soo is is texting me pictures of this guy, but I know I know does she not know that you have a semi-successful sports podcast. You can see is Rusty in this whole thing. She doesn't she forgets but although she did that before too. So maybe you know what maybe we're all just kind of back on track. That's true. She used to always call in the middle of it. Now. I got I got I got nothing. I'm happy to be back don't know yet. I think especially being bicoastal and being so accepting. I think that's going to be really good. It's a whole new world. Oh definitely wasn't before and it can't get any worse so true. But this show is really dependent on the Old Orchard the new Orchard everyone chiming in you know to tweet us to work us your thoughts comments even complaints will take them. I'm like, there's got to be a few at Apples to Apples PC. It's also in our anchor. Apparently we have a face smile. Anyway, I don't know anything about Facebook but we do okay, let's it's less utilized in 2019. It's so do we still have my space? I don't even we've never had it. I don't even know if it still exists. So it doesn't it. May Stone. I never I never even had well, I'll joking aside. Should we just jump into Katie's and then we'll talk some sports to wrap it up. Yeah, let's do it. All right. I guess it's time for kdz. I don't know if I have the intro music. I was just thinking about it. Oh, it's you know, they don't have to tell Katie. I'm gonna have to find her some new intro music I can put it together, but I'll need to find some 400 maybe next week, but just play it right now. Maybe I'll give her Wonderwall that would be bad and go. Hello Orchard, it's Katie here to give you a quick new edition of K Dee Zee your sports celebrity. Gossip super long time. No talk and no there is no JK after that because it has seriously been a long long long minute. Hope all is well with you and you are all having a fun summer, which by the way the fourth is over and so now basically So a summer SMH and cry face. Okay. So first up let's all join me in congratulating the u.s. Women's soccer team for winning the Women's World Cup. Yes. It was amazing. Right sure honestly and no digs to women's soccer or soccer in general. I mean, my son plays soccer, but I did not really watch but hey once again congrats to them. Oh, you know what? That means you don't well, I will tell you. It means that they get to go on the trip to the White House yippee or well maybe not so much According to some of the players on the team as in not going if invited how patriotic of them. Hhn enough said on that. So, okay. I really don't have a lot of earth-shattering sports stuff to talk with you about this week. So I thought I would do wot W for those of you who may not Member or know what that means. I will tell you right now ready. Okay, it's worth of the week. Okay, here it is a plum now, I will spell it out for you because I'm not sure that I'm pronouncing it correctly. But it's a PLO MB meaning is as follows self confident Assurance skill and Poise, especially in difficult or challenging circumstances. Okay. Now our present to you with a sentence using the word Mark received a job offer because of his ability to handle tasks with a bomb Orchard. That's all I have for you today. Remember to use the word of the week, which I'm not going to say again because I'm not really sure I'm saying it right. Anyway, it's just a quick Kate easy for you this week. Hope to talk at you soon again, Katie out. Oh, guess what? I forgot. Go twins. Yay. We're number one right now. Let's keep it moving right of course right. Ciao. And we're back. Wasn't that a skit from? Yes, it wasn't. Yeah, and we're back quite an addition of ke zi Shi Yu is cry face. Is that a new? Tournament remote that's an emoji is the I think she's referring to the Emoji but it's so she threw the cry face in there and then no digs soccer. I guess. I don't really understand what that meant. But she did congratulate as we all do and we probably were going to get to that the controversial United States women's soccer squad on their way in so thanks Katie for that's in two different soccer mentions, by the way in the same podcast. I know this one. Well, this one is a little bit more. I mean this one we would always it's World chi chi right here, right? No, you're right. I'm more just telling you this is it's slowly but surely moving that direction. She mentioned that they're going to be invited to the White House but not go I am so sick of it. I don't even care anymore. Don't go don't invite any. Who cares? Are they going to be invited I dial I want to invite them. They just said they're not gonna go so don't invite him. But you know what? I forgot that she did. Who's she there's that they're teenagers Katie Oh, I thought you meant one of the soccer Grim reality. She was with Katie's he's apparently she's hitting it big and she was on our show. Apparently. She's hitting it big in Hollywood. I don't know if she'll remember us one day. I there's no way I promise you. I'm sure she's already forgot us. But yeah, I guess she's a Netflix and a bunch of stuff. She was on our show, you know, I hope us Wyatt Wyatt. Well, why it for sure I think goes without saying I miss him Kevin Club. Yeah, I was gonna say your old friends your old friend Kendall Kendall. Hey pigs. She's on the ground season take box channel. Nine news are in the morning. She's in the morning because she's she did a big left us for nothing. I know we'll have to make her come back on. Yeah. Well, she she would never give this up. Of course, she'll come back. We probably need permission now from Channel 9. No. I promise you that will be a very highly scrutinized episode. That'll that'll need to go through some some, you know, they're not so great either. So we're not going to run their candle and Kevin know Kendall's great. I'm talking about the Fox 9 Morning Show, so she'll be fine. Well, I can't believe you just said that and I'll let me know if she comes on our show. I meant we can't we're not going to ruin their show. They should let her come on. I'm just saying I can't you shouldn't have said that when we're trying is that wasn't bad. Well, then have two or maybe two out of five. Is there five like major news networks ABC NBC CBS. Well, we got Frank or I'm saying we have two out of five or two out of four major News Network personalities. Yeah. I just talked to him the other day. I'm sure he'd be well he had to get permission to come on to see that's what I'm saying. You shouldn't trust their trash. They're hella trashing them. I'm just saying we're not going to ruin their not nice things to say. I did have nice things this in fact, it's the only station I watch in the morning. So don't tell Frank that he will he's not on in the morning. He's on then you can tell him that yeah, I stay I'll stand by. So I forgot the katydid the word of the week. And she wasn't sure how to pronounce it which is really no shocker because she doesn't know how to pronounce anything but aplomb. I you pronounce it correctly. Okay. She must be really excited when the spelling bee comes. I was just thinking of that but we'll rigging news. Oh breaking news Sue has texted me. Okay. Have you guys not been responding? No, I don't kind of busy. I am am being I'm trying to be professional. She wants to know why don't the Yankees have names on their jerseys tell her it's tradition. They also don't have beards. So she said they're not allowed to have facial hair so she should love them. So she should like the Yankees. Then Katie as you guys all heard the expression don't the Yankees have names but I hear sorry Katie gave a shout out and a congratulations to the twins, which is probably the kiss of death. So it's not that they didn't have their own. That's it's a fair point. That's a fair point. I might as well just go sour on them, but welcome ktz back. It was brief to the point and kind of just, you know at eased back exact opposite of the rest of the show and her Mille segments which will be you know, she'll be a regular she'll be back at your comments at Katie. Anything else guys? I'm Kate easy just happy to have her back. It's such a crucial segment. We could have done this this first episode without her and we want the Sam. Well, of course, I could have spoken it better myself. I'm just really distracted by his Schreiner. I didn't notice it. I mean I'm used to wearing mascara, but it's not fully it's just in the corner. So that's why I realized it wasn't the mascara. But anyway, Sam's mascara has nothing to do with anything. Right now sure some everything to do something. It does actually but when you get that we don't have time trying to extend to another Community. That's right. He lives out in the Silicon Valley. Anyways, I think we need to talk some sports. You know, what I want to start with a spot beginning that's usually where I want to start but this is I'm actually starting at the end well because I will never watch this league ever a gain as Chris Jericho and said the NBA I have to say I have zero interest isn't fair. I have less than zero interest in the NBA. Thoughts you too. Why do you listen zero interest? Oh you like you need to expand on that because I because I am so well clearly the players run the league. So I don't want to address here hundred percent sure. I don't want to ever ever hear them complain about owners the word owner know they run the entire league and if they're good guys that suck make ten million dollars a year guys. That's sort of suck make 15 Lillian and if you just awful you make five to seven million a year, it's insane now having said that here's what I'll say. I can't go here unless you come with I mean jeez, it's ridiculous the whole. Yeah the yeah. No, that's I mean, I don't hate I don't disagree with your well, I don't disagree with anything. You said I don't hate that. I'm not going here unless you come with me think just because I think it makes for some pretty fun teams to watch. Yeah for the factually it's crazy to say but it actually almost in a way split up some like, you know, bigger. Super power is teams and that it was still in the same scenario where it's only a small number of teams have a chance, but at least now that numbers larger than 3 it's like 6 and here that I will say though that I absolutely absolutely agree with like the players run the league if you demand a trade in the NFL you're getting sent to Buffalo. You're not getting sent to Miami. Where do you want to go? Like they're like bending over backwards to try and like and you know, I would honestly almost Argue as they should for some of these players that have given them so much. They should want to help them go from one place to another go to where they want to be if they can make it work financially for their own teams, but at the end of the day, I agree with you like they they run things and it's not that and it is not that way in other leagues. If you demand a trade another League you're getting sent wherever they want to send you and it's not going to be somewhere you like Michael. Jordan would not be team. I mean he was on a good team, but he was on the team they drafted the guys rod. In the got in a trade, but the he would not be calling is to team up with them not a chance and this is I mean and it just it LeBron James he can't eat you know, he gets his you know, he owns. What's his name Anthony Davis he owns him because of his agency owns them, but they couldn't get anyone else. No one else and then Kawhi Leonard wasn't I mean I get it. I understand he doesn't live in Toronto. I understand. He's probably in a better team but really, I mean, I'll come here if you get this. And then like you said, they go get it's ridiculous that it should be the NBA in the mbb. So take the six teams that anyone cares about and Utah and Denver going to be really good but they're I mean, they're not going to now they'll be really good and they'll be top. I mean, I guess in the west now they'll they will easily make the playoffs but they don't stand a chance against some of the other teams Leonard went to LA because he's from La he didn't want to go to town. You know, it does go back a little bit when I said he didn't want to go to Toronto necessarily like that was a tray that he may not have had a lot of of impact on Toronto traded for him to have exactly what happened happened. They traded him knowing they probably weren't going to re-sign him but they thought he could win a championship and he want him a championship and that's all they wanted from him. So when he left it was like, you know what thank you. It's what we wanted. Good luck in La I have found out he's from La for what's right, but I agree. It's like the guy I'll come out only come to you. If you also get this guy no one thought he was going to the Clippers until the day he went to the Clippers and all of a sudden Paul. George is going to So it's I think it makes for some exciting free agency. Honestly, I think it's pretty crazy. And to be honest if if I was a more. Like if I was a fan of a more borderline team, you know, let's say I was a Celtics fan or I was a you know, even in Miami Heat fan now that they have Jimmy Butler like some of those more well good luck with that. Idiot for a number of reasons. If I was a more kind of borderline a fan of a more borderline team like that. I would be upset with this stuff but the term will suck so much. All I can do is to enjoy the league as a whole and and you know, watch the fun games with the fun teams when they're on on and enjoy kind of the commune. Oh, There is no doubt that the Clippers were still Lakers will be fun games to watch or or a lot of those other teams in the playoffs will be fun and it'll add a small it'll add a new twist. There's new guys all over the place and but the fact that the Timberwolves won't even sniff. The playoffs is like makes me more interested actually in the league as a whole. I have a question for you, too. And I'm going to start it with the statement that's normally a weird way to ask a question. But whatever. I despise Russell Westbrook already know you're going to hate. I agree. Absolutely despise them Sam no relation. I'll go to you first. The only chance to Timberwolves have of even being semi interested is if they trade for him true or false entry semi-interesting or like us and that's for Sam first, not you back interesting by the fans. Thank you. Yeah question as well, oh let me rephrase it and the only reason the only way this the Timberwolves will be even close to being interesting this year is if they trade for the guy that I hate the most in the NBA actually I don't hate him the most anymore. He's like V on my list some guys have gone ahead of them but is that a true statement or a false statement Sam no relation I'd say it's true but I don't know if he'd be interested in a good way because likely karl-anthony towns may want to leave because has no one wants to play with Westbrook or the other way around Westbrook will want to leave after 2 months still risk you take I do not think we should trade for him, but it would certainly be more interesting. I don't think we have a choice but Drew go ahead. I think you look at this here as just A lost cause well like the last 20. Okay. Well, they've all been long but that's like no I know but I think I think they made the run at their guy and Russell they didn't give them because he wanted to play for the Warriors and I can't blame him. He's not even a play for him for like a month and they're getting and then and maybe we can get them into who knows but my point I guess my point was I agree with Sam in the sense that I don't like Russell Westbrook makes you a very good team, but it's probably only going to run it because another Jimmy Type of situation it's going to kind of stunt cats great cats growth a little bit. And if that's the guy you're trying to build around you see through this year. You let Tiegs count contract comes off the book. You look to move Wiggins if you can or if you think you need to I think corgis contract might be up after this year or not. You look to move him because he's an expiring contract and you can do that and then you go get your you go get it you go get a start-up play with cat. I agree with Sam that I don't like Westbrook is a Band-Aid to maybe you no win some games this year, but you're not going to those two together is not going to help cat in the long run. It's not going to help the team in the long run and you have this new regime Saunders officially has the keys. I think you let them work through what they want to do is a team and you let some of those that those bad dollars come off the book at the end of the year and start fresh before we did leave it goes to show this off season goes to show just how much Thibodeau screwed this team up every single decision that we are hand. By is his fault. Well part of what I was going to say. Is this new regime thing we seem to have new regimes all the time. So I just I have no interest. Yeah, but I wouldn't say Glen Taylor is the best judge of talent, but that's a separate discussion. Now, he's terribly he's a terrible this case. I think I think this guy I think Rose awesome these guys that they he's got sort of know. I think they know what they're doing more than anyone else. We've had it for me to just flip. Hopefully they win the summer league and we can hang II although I love the summer league. I love all those Oh, we are looky there that guy that rookie that we just signed isn't playing in the summer league so he can get caught up. Isn't that what the summer leaks for? What am I missing Advocates? Not Saunders isn't coach summer league. He's just he's working with Saunders Town wagons, but I'm on the court. Are you kiddo stupid whatever. This is stupid. All right, but why put him on the court with nine guys, he's not going to play with I want you two guys to explain to me how the Vikings are going to get in the playoffs with a below-average defense overrated deep. The bags are so bad. I could catch a pass on them and I believe there is no there are there is okay. Well, there's no killer average. Yeah, I was gonna say anything but average I think I think defensive backs in the NFL are just playing at a any kind of your grill just sucks. We out the deal. What's the guy true? But what's that horrible guy from Michigan State? I can't remember his name. He's so bad Trae Waynes. Yes, awful Hughes is pretty good, but he can't walk anymore. So I guess yeah Alexander is might be the best out of the three. Okay. Well there were going to hang out ahead on them. So no I'm so I want you to but like there's what there's no really really good. There's very few very good defensive back fields, except for the teams with really good defense as but in any case, I don't think I don't let me get to my question. I think it's I think it's a defense as a whole and I think you're I want you to yeah number 28 and 29 exactly. Those are ours. No as of 26, the Bears defense is better than ours. But having said that they were Okay, it's like I'm gonna give you a how much I forgot. You know what I think I'm second-guessing doing this testing. One two, testing one two, if you two would let me get the question on him and let you come if you didn't have such stupid things to say we would let you I'm a it's not a stupid question. I want you to convince me with the second toughest schedule in the league next this year coming up how we're going to make the playoffs which every one of you wants to go first go. And seen see there you go. It wasn't this one thing you say I want one of you I want both of you to convince me with the second toughest schedule in the league next year where this coming year how the Vikings are going to make the playoffs with basically the same team. I don't know if I necessarily could but like it doesn't mean I'm not going to watch why didn't say anything about what I mean. I could tell you why you're going to tell me I'm wrong. I could give you some reasons. I just don't necessarily mean I believe they're going to be true but don't make things up. I'm not gonna make things up but you just said it's not I think their defense is better than you're giving them credit for I think they're at minimum a top-10 defense. There are very few defenses in the league that have the continuity. They do you're right the defensive backs maybe aren't great. But they have one of the best defensive lines in the league. They keep Kendrick sambar who are really the linchpin of that defense and and the defensive staff is in place as well. You look on the offensive side of the ball and not even touch on Kirk Cousins because it's like who even can sort a know what is going to come out of him? You know, you could blame it on one thing the other he's going to be who he's going to be. Hopefully he can somehow make a step forward with a coordinator that maybe listens to him a little bit more. I don't think I don't think Dean Philippa was ever going to work. I think he was more interested in promoting himself than anyone else and really doing what was best for the team and it goes to show I'm not sure stefanski is the answer. So I'm happy they brought in Kubiak. I think you give you know a guy with head coaching and coordinator experience to somebody who's been around a lot of different offenses. They can do a lot of creative things. We have one of the best receiving cores in the league Dalvin cook should hopefully be healthy this year if he can stay healthy. He's a more one of the more Dynamic backs in the league and you have An offensive line, that won't be as awful as it's been it should be it should be average and I think you know, it's a it was a sad thing to kind of confront looking at last year but the offensive line with our weakness and and the coach unfortunately passed away before the year and I don't think you can Overlook that now you're right. We do have the second hardest schedule, but you know what? I think there's reasons to be optimistic. I think there's reasons to be positive, but I wouldn't I'm not going to sit here and tell you that I'd put every dollar I have on them. In the playoffs, but I think I think you're understanding them a little bit. I think the NFL is at a point right now where defenses are at a pretty substantial disadvantage and I forget the brief part. I'm sorry when I say brief. No, I meant keep it brief. I may have forgot that go. Sam wasn't going to answer. So yeah, he's daring to go. He's eating it. He heard you ask the question and answer. I just didn't have an answer because the answer was I can't because well the I like my God wait Sam's a green with me. Me. Yeah, I know. I'm not saying I like I'm going to convince you but you know, the I think you're I think you're underselling how good they are how how how much of a chance they have and they have an overrated last year, but they may be underrated this year because no one is expecting anything from I would agree with that but we have to lie wide receivers wide receivers only running back average Quarterback better offensive line still a pretty good defense. So well, Silver chance we got when you set a lead that bring something up we got many many many more weeks or maybe at least two more to talk about the Vikings before we get canned but speaking of a lead. Is there any chance if luck you is going to be any better this year? Although definitely be better. They're not going to win the Big Ten. They'll be better. This still barely get any recruits. I don't get it one four-star recruit. That's it. Because he's not a good recruiter. I think he is. I just I don't think there's a lot to really come play for in Minnesota. Like it's they're not they haven't been very good and it's cold and okay. I don't know but I think they'll be better. All right. Well, that's good. Here's what I will say that you want to talk about an elite receiving Corps. Those guys are going to be fun to watch if they can know God was gonna throw in the ball. And it's a problem. They may not even they shouldn't even play with a quarterback. They should figure out which of those running backs can throw and play with three running backs in the backfield and and two or three wide receivers out there at all time sure we can make is running back. Yeah. I'm sure we can find another they should just place a slow and quarter white walk on quarterback that we could use you. I don't know there's no way that Seth Green is not the best quarterback on that roster and to put him with stand next to you intercepted them. I dropped it in all fairness. But are you bringing that up now? It's okay. That's fair. It's a fair. It's a very not only did you drop it? You dropped it in the end zone. No. Oh, yes. It was like six you were standing in the end zone. You have jumped around the end zone. I was standing on the 10-yard line and had a free path to the end zone. Okay said I was that in the end zone and I dropped it. I will own up to it, but you don't have a choice. It's probably a video to somewhere. So it's maybe that might have been scrubbed from the I forgot how hot these earphones get and her house and the house God what dear honor Something it's a good thing. I know I think they'll be better. I think they got they talk about quarterback issues. Oh, no, it's like you all right, but they'll be taught that team will be fun to watch because they'll have some high scoring games. Plus they got that they got the World's Strongest Man playing right tackle. Yes sixties what 712 he's like legitimately for Hive hundred that guy, huh? You said 712? Yeah. No, I think he's actually like six they listed at 7:12 Orleans. Yeah, he's huge. Let's skip the twins till next time because there's going to be sold so many disappointments today been doing Isles Dynasty who the American League? Yeah, Dale won seven straight seat. Of course, that's why they had to get rid of the World Series Van Gogh and RBI, so we are talking to me. Now, we're not all talking all star game. Do we even I mean wild what can you even say? The often I like the Zuccarello signing. Well, yeah, how about Phil Kessel went to the school here and here he would rather go to Arizona to play hockey then here that's why pathetic. I mean Arizona is nice in the winter. Well not if you're they were pretty good last year after they weren't any they were better than we were well, yeah true, you know faith we would get any better though. I don't know. Why you well, I don't have much faith in these still sucks. It's the same abilities in the same team. I don't know this about a cup of coffee and this is it's probably not fair because it's the only way we're going to get them and it if we had made some better signings alongside, then we would have obviously been better. But the that Parisi Suitor dual contract is gonna It's going to handcuff us that although unfreeze he's heard every year doesn't know and that and that some say it's not totally fair to say that because when they were when they first came if we would have just put some better players around them. We could have been a lot better. It's not their fault. But man that's a lot of money committed to a guys that are going to be pretty old pretty soon here, but maybe that makes us really bad and I think we've discussed before the worst thing you can do is be average especially in the NHL and that's what we are. We never bought them all so we never get a good draft pick we'd make Stupid trades the trades that guy made like that for this Fenton guy is ridiculously bad doesn't mean he's just he's not great. I do like the Zuccarello signing. Yeah, he's good would have been nice to get castle or pavelski or one of those other guys, but as I think he's he was a good signing. I think he's Somebody went and I don't understand hookers our best player and they want to get rid of them. It's just ridiculous II agree with you. I don't get it. Um anything else you guys want to cover on our first show? We'll get to the twins.

Welcome back in another edition of the college football news podcast mix-up pow ski with you. Keep you check out for this one, but I welcome it now from a man. You've read his work you've seen as by lines on college football news Pro Football Weekly various different places inside the pile on pile on you podcast. You've heard him host before Jeff are kind enough to join me for a few minutes tonight on the college football news podcast. What's up, Jeff? Nick, man. Good talk. Good to talk to you. College football is within our within our sights. Yeah. I know it. It's like you wait all offseason. You wait all summer. And finally it's like alright, the day count is down to single digits were about to Miami or about to Florida have that to kick things off and be the be our counterpart for the rest of the summer into the fall, but I guess the the conversation starts when you bring up college football anymore and it's like the NBA was four years with the Warriors in the Cavs is it is simple to you to the numbers play out from everything. You've seen that it's Clemson, it's Bama or it's Bama. It's Clemson. It's a gap than Georgia and a gap and everyone else my first reaction this season following especially Following last season was I'm ready for Alabama to run roughshod over everyone. I think it's going to be a revenge tour that we've never seen before not that they need more motivation other than just having really good players. I think being being handled on the national stage as they were last year my number. Something looking looking out. This year is is is Bama is not it's not will Clemson rebound. Are they the new Alabama but I think Alabama is ready to just run through everybody Clemson is typically lost. I think last year was unique that through the Brent venables the era they've typically lost a lot of defensive players last year. They returned a lot for the really the first time. I think they've gone a few years where they lost at least half of the guys in their defense and still being good. So this year, I mean, I'm still expecting that but their top players all across the board now, I mean, you lost your dad we talked about feral and Wilkins and Mitch Hyatt a lot of leadership on that Squad and you know, Trevor Lawrence probably the best quarterback in the country, but where is that other piece going to come from for Clemson? So that's how I look at it right now, especially with those two teams. I do think there are a number of teams down below them that are talented enough to have it to me to have a shot, but it would be really tough. I was putting any money on either and any team this year to go against either Clemson our Bama. Yeah, look at it in Clemson. I do have a little bit of concern just because how much of that defensive line. You've seen stars go year after year after year with them, but just the this year. It's like well, it's a collective whole holy cow. Like that's a ton of NFL Talent. They lose. I just don't look at their schedule and who's supposed to scare me? Like I honestly do not have an answer on that like who is Spike Texas A&M is an interesting game early on but there's no reason they A shouldn't just run rampant over the rest of the ACC South. Carolina's not going to give them a scare. It's gonna be a team that's 13 and oh again, come college football playoff. And then it's them against Bama them against Georgia them against whoever and there's no reason or not one of the two or three best teams in the country. I mean the Georgia Tech opening game is going to be pretty pretty rough for for the Yellowjackets just because they're changing schemes, but I think I am I'm you saw a tough and I'm played them last year at home granted. It was at it was a tan. But you saw a tough. They played them last year. I think this am team will be better than they were last year. This comes into your baby a little were so catching them early and you go at Syracuse the next week and two years ago. They lost in the dome and the Carrier Dome. So that's a tough early game, especially with the experience Syracuse team coming back. Yeah me the rest of the schedule. Isn't that rough? It's really those those games early on because the rest of the time they get BC at home. I like BC but getting them at home. I don't think that's gonna be a tough one, Florida State at home again. Florida State Should bounce back and play better, but I don't see them giving us here. So it's really those the game 2 and Game 3 and passed that it really goes to is Clemson could be tested enough during the regular season to be ready to play those tougher teams and leagues is the playoff this year. Get to the playoffs this year. I'm really saying when yeah, I mean, I think it's pretty much to me. It's a when it's a game of one like I don't see like Syracuse to change the quarterback. I hate I'm not as thrilled with Syracuse this year. I was surprised when they're first number came out. It was like a five and a half wind totally got bed all the way up to like eight eight and a half. I'm not as big on Syracuse this year that Texas A&M game I think is going to be one of the better games this season, especially non-conference games for the year, but I just don't see something in the ACC. It's Clemson. It's a huge gap and it's a lot of question marks. After that, one of the things I think is interesting though is looking at the rest of the SEC and the talent obviously speaks for itself. Like how close for you is LSU to Bama or Florida to Georgia because I think it's it's almost like you view that conference right now is the rest of college football views Clemson versus Bama. It's a countdown until it's Bama in Georgia in Atlanta. I mean, how real is a threat from Florida? How real is a threat from anyone else in the West for? For Alabama this year. Yeah, fuck bam in the Tier 1 by themselves, but I would group LSU Georgia and Florida together in that next tier. I mean Florida's offensive line is it might be an issue LSU's defense is going to be a killer. I mean that's that's a squad right there with and with Delta with Fulton with morons where you're going to have a ton of guys that are going to see on Sundays that are going to be a problem. It's just whether or not Joe burrow can continue what he did last year and that's always been the question with Alice. You are going to get a play making out of the quarterback position. Offense but I do I do like LSU a lot this year Georgia. I mean Jacob from has got to play a little better. They're going to have they're going to have a good offensive line. They're going to be under a Swift and Beatrice Robinson. And then that defense are always gonna have guys coming out with a recruiting classes that they've been putting out and the Florida. I mean Philippe Franks has got to play the way he's supposed to play. I think the way they expect him to play in Florida. So I would put those teams on one tier and I know off are we talked a little bit of Mississippi State and I was as you see some of the numbers behind them this year and we know another year or more heads offense Kyle and Hills a playmaker for them did lose a lot in Abram and Montez sweat and Jeff Simmons on defense, but I do think Mississippi state is another squad on that maybe a third tier with am right now and I am going to be coming up. I mean am look really good on the national stage a few times last year and I think Jimbo's going to have them playing. Well, I'm it's hard to look at Bama in the same group as any of these guys right now, but I do think there are a number of teams in the SEC that People scare this year. Yeah the Ingham thing. It's you look at their schedule and it's Clemson ridiculous. And then there yeah, Texas State and Lamar out of conference, but they're at LSU there at Georgia this year, Mississippi State on the schedule Auburn on the schedule. It's like there's no slouches for them. That's got to be amongst. If not the toughest schedule for any team in the entire country. This season is going to be tough again to Auburn. This is not and I guess this is kind of the not to not to draw comparisons across Sports but you know, how is old gets his team ready in the regular season for for the tournament. I mean this is their ready every year for the playoffs because they do play a tough schedule. They've got a cupcake sprinkled here or there but they didn't shy away two years ago and they play Florida stay in the nest in the first game of the season on a neutral field of said, let's go they roll the ball out and they took care of business. So that's bad is never a concern with me for dammit. I never look at scheduled bam. I look at the squad they have coming back. And right now you're looking at them having the probably the Most talented quarterback date had under saving the most talented most talented receiving Corps. They've had their to save and another awesome running back and Nagi Harris who finally get his share of the carries and then a ton of guys on defense. So bam is going to be trouble and schedule really doesn't matter. You mentioned the quarterback to Otunga Viola. I always have arguments with Pete teams, like everything that we start talking about. He's more of a to a guy. I think the Trevor Lawrence is the best quarterback in college football. I think he's going to be the most decorated college football player by the time he goes to the draft a couple years from now and I think he's going to probably lead them to another National Championship in the next two seasons and he's gonna be as decorated as anyone probably since Tim Tebow that we've seen you have to take one of those for their NFL careers from what you've seen so far. Which one do we are you Takin Trevor Lawrence turtle or throats out. See I wish people is here because he just I don't see it. I don't see it as much Pete. Hope you download this and listen to this. I don't know how you can not see it. I'm I like to but when I'm looking at guys within the lens of and maybe this is a personal preference thing to neck is I look at guys like Justin Herbert even about above to and that's just we're looking at you know arm strength. We're looking at me. He's we're looking at build. I mean we try not to because there's been people that have succeeded at the NFL level with a not typical build and people reference Drew Brees people reference Russell Wilson, but more times than not it's people built like Trevor Lawrence that succeeded the NFL level and you see him. I mean God zip the ball. I mean, he's throwing he's throwing out patterns across the field on a I mean just zip it in there and to it listen to his made a lot of plays to a can keep plays alive. He's heavy. He's smart. He's tough and he's got he's got a ton of skills and he's going to be a first round pick, but if you're asked me one of those guys Trevor Lawrence with a bullet. Yeah could not agree with you more and I can just hope that our guy Pete Feud. Is listening to this and shaking his head and disagreeing somewhere far away. Something is a look at nationally here obviously have to bring up the Big Ten that's against that's local for both of us. Are you buying the Michigan hype not until they actually do something right in the time that the time they had to do it was when they had was the peppers team two years ago. That was the squad. I had pushed all my chips in on I was like, these guys are make the playoffs. This is the team that's going to do it and You know, I get another lost Ohio State. So that was by far the most talented team. They've had under Harbaugh and with all the losses on defense this year, you know, Devin Bush and when a bitch and I mean she Patterson didn't really show me much last year. I just I'm kind of like in a wait-and-see mode with them. I'm going to say they're not going to do it until they actually do it. It's where I'm at with it too. It's just I get it. They don't lose games. They're not supposed to lose and there is something to be said for that but they don't beat tell me when Jim Harbaugh has beaten a team at Michigan that has anywhere near as much talent as him. But it hasn't happened yet. Right and it's like I just look at it and it's okay like in that schedule is yeah, they get Notre Dame at home. You have to get Ohio State at home like that Wisconsin game. They have to travel to Wisconsin. That's not going to be easy to Penn State and Penn State's kind of in a rebuild type of season going on with them. But you get Penn State middle towards the end of the year like that's gonna be a different team than it is going to be like if you were playing them in September or late September and I think that's kind of where I just look at Michigan team and until they actually show me. Can't get on board with it. So that mean you're full on board with Ohio State because I threw one by Pete who I think's going to win the Big Ten and it wasn't either one of those is it was at Ohio State for you, then that you're still fully on board with when in the Big Ten I was looking if I was looking to Futures that's for Michigan State. Thank you. Call me crazy. I didn't realize that with you. But yeah, that's what I told Pete the other day and he did you really like I had three heads. I told him like when you have the best defense in the conference, I don't think that's much of a question. Maybe the you can look at Ohio State and Sarah. Has more on a felt Allen on their defense, there's not a better defensive unit the Michigan State in this conference and tell me which coach in the Big Ten you take over dantonio because I don't think there is one and now that's not to say that Ryan Day can't turn into that. He's not that yet. It's you mix the best events with the best coach in offense that I just don't think can be anywhere near as bad as it was last year not to say it's gonna be anything special and I'll take my ten to one twelve to one chances on that. And if you remember before last season which Big Ten quarterback in a me a big-time quarterback that was getting more love than Brian low working. There wasn't many know if any and then he was banged up all last year. He was not healthy at any point during last season if he's healthy now. That's a team that is it 17 starters back. Dantonio typically has that team play better than the talent on the field on the talent. They have at the beginning of year. They always they always outplay their talent and that's a team that I often look to from looking for a team to exceed expectations. You know, I look at Iowa is it seems like every other year I Has a good year or they and then they go down and they go back up. They go down a little bit always kind of hovering around 9 and 3 6 & 6 but with Michigan State before that 2016 kind of blip on the radar last year. They definitely underplayed but aside from that they've constantly out performed and like you said, this is the best events of the Big Ten. Maybe not the most talented but the best unit in the Big Ten and then if it will work, he is healthy. They're going to be a problem and Michigan They're not afraid to play Michigan at in Ann Arbor. No not whatsoever. And yes, they have to go to Ohio State. They have to go to Wisconsin and back-to-back weeks. I'm not saying they're going to run the table in the Big Ten, but I think they have plenty of talent. They have a pain in the ass defense that's going to I feel like knock one of these teams off if not two of them and all of a sudden they're right there in the running. And when this whole thing that's been made all offseason of owes us to your Ohio State finally Falls to Michigan. Can the Wolverine trying to get by like, Michigan. Not being only the best team in their own damn State let alone their own division or conference. I I'm I don't I look at Michigan State and I just think that's the formula of if you want success that that is that's what you're looking at. And that's a team that I think is going to surprise and turn a lot of heads this season looking out a little bit more nationally Big 12 wise Oklahoma second year in a row. They replace the first overall pick in the Heisman Trophy winner. How much is the fall off there? Because it's not just that it's an offensive line that losses for starters as well. Is is this Like finally the time that Lincoln Riley gets to deal with the the tough like overhaul of a roster college football wise or is it just a machine that just kind of reloads and keeps going for them. I think of that conference, especially when you eat do have if you have a talent at quarterback and that Lincoln Riley offense and as much as Jalen hurts, his Moline during his time in bama, he's a talent and he's a he's a highly rated recruit for a reason he put up numbers for a reason. I think he's going to be I think they're going to be just fine CD lamb are I believe the biggest play maker in the country on the outside. They're stacked at tailback. They create Humphreys. Maybe the best player in the Big 12 in the office of why that's Center. They have replacing everybody else. But they've done that before they Oklahoma gets guys. That's that's not what they're framed offensively defensive never really their calling card. It's it hasn't been for quite some time since early in the Stoops era, but they're going to put up points and they're going to that's in Big 12 team that puts up. Most points off as most successful and I don't see anyone that schedule right now outside of I mean people are blown up Texas. It almost seems like the Texas train came a year early and now everyone's jumping on board maybe a little too. Maybe they come back to earth a little bit this year. But TCU is the team I think in the Big 12, that is get maybe the give Oklahoma some problems. That's that's the squad I'm looking at right now that could give them as problems. Okay? Why do you like to see you so much because I have somebody else in the Big 12 that I am very high on. It's one of the it's the coaching Trust. With Patterson and it's they often, you know, they've had at least 11 wins and three of The Last Five Years. They've got got 12 starters back which isn't isn't a lot but again, like I said see the lamb before Jalen reger's maybe 1A or 1B to him in this first Playmakers in the in the conference and they to experience its experienced team. They've been through the ringer Patterson is the best is my estimation the best overall coach of the Big 12 and a lot of times if there's have some tea my sort of like sort of don't like I lean toward the coach and there's no one really on that TCU schedule that I could see them at. It's the at Oklahoma game, but again jumps out to me and I don't know. I don't know why this year when I look at the big 12, it's really just Oklahoman TCU then I'm looking at yeah, Texas is going to be good. But I do expect them to take a little bit of a step back from their from their last season who's the team that you're looking at like I like Iowa State are you? Okay, you mentioned the coaching part of it and I common trend for me to that's why I like Michigan State so much is largely because of their coach, but I look at Iowa State. Ensure you have to replace in all World running back last year in Montgomery, but you had probably the best freshman quarterback. That wasn't named Trevor Lawrence in the entire country year experience with him. You get T. See you at home you get Texas at home for that team. I think that that's one that Matt Campbell right now. I expect him to be in the NFL before too long and a Lincoln Riley's name is always the one of the big 12 that gets thrown out there. Like I look at Campbell is a guy that's going to be coaching on an NFL sideline before long if he wants to if not that he's going to go to a Big-time college program that's not names Iowa, and I kind of combined all of that a favorable schedule and I look at that as a team that's has a damn good shot to be played in the Big 12 championship and they've got the best front seven in the conference. They either offensive line and returns all five starters and they've got the best front seven of Defense the conference micros ji Quan Bailey two guys that are going to be are going to be hopefully more known this season is to go through I like Iowa State a lot too and I agree with you on Campbell. I mean that guy is guy's a star and he's going to be a bigger job sooner than later. Yeah, that's the part that I see on it. And it's also they get Iowa at home. Not that that's important for for in terms of deciding the Big 12, but at least in terms of a rivalry game and a game that's going to give them a little bit more a little bit more exposure and they beat Iowa early on I just kind of going through conferences here Pac-12 when you look at that in terms of talent, they haven't won a big game out of conference. I don't know the last one probably last time Stanford beat Notre Dame. I can probably be the last one that's considered but about right. Yeah, I It just seems like it's few and far between when they get a marquee win against an out of conference opponent organ takes on Auburn this year, otherwise chances. There aren't a whole heck of a lot of them. How does it work in stack up against Auburn and how does this conference kind of Stack up to the rest of the power fives? I mean for getting it seems like there's a lot of people on the end organs bandwagon this year two to one of the favored they return 17 starters. I mean Justin Herbert to the how you want to look at a when he would have been your first quarterback had he gone Have you gone out this year? We have been your first quarterback had he gone out to the draft. Yes. Yeah, and that's based on I mean it's a lot of its based on projection because those people point to his completion percentage and say he hasn't completed up passes for me is not as consistent as you like. I just think he has the look of a guy that and you dig in because you didn't do the extensive NFL work on emerged as extensive film work on them because he didn't come out but he's a guy that consistently made plays outside the pocket inside the pocket. He's playing in front of her and back of one of the best offensive lines in the country. So that gives him a little clearance but Yeah, you made plays and he's he has the look of a quarterback and has the has the tools of the quarterback that I like. So yeah, he would have been the number one guy. I would have taken this year and that offensive line is something special maybe the best offensive line of the country. Troy die die on defense has a star at linebacker. They have Playmakers in this outside. Although I'm still waiting for jajuan Johnson the transfer for Penn State to make a play. It seems like people have been talking about him for three years and he still has done anything, so waiting on that to happen, but if there's As a team and I don't know how you feel about this. But if there's a team that I'm looking to make a move in the Pac-12 this year, it's Utah if Tyler Huntley is healthy at quarterback. I think that's the team with the best best front for one of the best front force in the country. And the Jaylen Johnson who I expect to be a first round pick a corner next year. I think that's a team that is going to be in Kyle Whittingham again, we go back to the coaching thing. It's just a trusted coach a guy that gets the most out of his team's so I like Utah and that conference, but other than that, I mean, Looking for USC to rebound Washington loses a jake Browning for the first time in six years. He's not gonna be starting quarterback for them. And then Stanford is always pretty good under Shaw Washington State loses Minshew a quarterback. So still a lot of unknowns. No one's really solidified themselves at the as the consistent presence and the presence in that conference. You know is Colorado one of these teams under Mel Tucker that's going to make a comeback, you know, her men were just still trying to do something Arizona State, but you toss the squad that I'm looking at this here to possibly do some that the Pac-12 so I don't know. I don't know how you're looking at that but I that's that's the team that I would be picking if anyone is going to come out of there and go to the playoff. I'd be looking at Utah. Yeah, I think Utah is probably should I put this I don't want to say safe pick. I mean, you're the Utah Utes, but it's kind of playing in the south is favorable to them. Last year was such a weird year because quarterback gets hurt. They had who else got hurt for them last year. I'm trying to remember the running back no running back. Yeah. They both go down. You think their season is over and all of a sudden they take off and up winning the South their offense is depleted by Have to get to the conference Championship in one of the uglier Conference Championship Games. You'll see they still went down to the wire against Washington in that game. Then they blew a big lead against Northwestern and their bowl game. So it's one of those of like, it feels like last year was a nice pleasant surprise for them, but I don't I don't think that they're I think Oregon or Washington one of those teams has the potential to be the best team. However, they also play with you know, beating up on each other in playing in the same division. And by the time you get to the conference Championship Game those guys could simply be playing for a Rose Bowl berth when Utah would have a potential Spot Shot at the playoffs on the line that yeah, if there's a team that I think would be able to earn a spot to the playoffs based off of schedule based off of where they'd be sitting entering Conference Championship weekend. I think I agree with you on it being Utah. I don't know if I buy them being the best team. I think that there's more Talent than one Washington and organs rosters if that makes any sense a little bit. I agree with you there because a lot of my a lot of my picking, Utah. Is the coach factor in the The Experience factor that because I think there's a lot built into that Utah program with crystal ball in his second year at Oregon. Just so kind of waiting to see what is he going to what is he going to solidify their for the Ducks? But if you're looking at the team with the best quarterback in the best Playmakers and the best offensive line now, I'm just kind of selling Oregon for a person that didn't even take or again. I'm going to sell the organ for you, but that'd be that's that's a good selection in Washington is going to be interesting because I think Chris Peterson has I think he's he's kind of got that program where they could they'd is this the year. This will be the test here. Is this a program now where you know, they're going to be good here. And you're out they they have been consistently bringing in guys bring it in guys. And I think this is the first year without browning without Gaskin, you know, a lot of that a lot of the face of that Squad is gone now and I know they I know because of injury They're bringing back the bring back Tre Adams on the offensive line. Aaron for is a Budweiser receiver and absolute stud a wide receiver, but you know there it's the test here for Washington. I really want to see what happens with them. I'm very curious because I was a huge fan of them. I know we pick them much higher than they were when they made the playoffs in 16. I know we pinpointed them as a team to watch that year. They played outstanding but I think what's interesting is again if we're talking about coaches with with him and Whittingham and who else dantonio me and there's a lot of guys that because of their body of work. They have garnered more trust in people that watch college football as far as when you're making progress prognostications for the year. Yeah, and it's you always expect him to get better and improve his a year goes on and it's always feels like a safe bet it's absurd that like you look at Utah and now they're packed fall for a good decade or so now so it has a different feel but like this was little old Utah 15 years ago when Whittingham took over for for a guy named Urban Meyer like oh, yeah, the old talks about maybe you talking crash the BCS. Urban Meyer got him to do that. That's like Well, maybe they win one of these games against the big time team and Whittingham got them to do that. They beat Alabama in the Sugar Bowl the one you're all of a sudden. It's like it's a Pac-12 team and you're realistically looking at it before the year of like wouldn't be that huge of an upset of the Utah Utes earn a college football playoff. It's just it's insane of like little Utah has come and turned into this and it's just it's kind of weird of looking back of what Utah Sports words. Like I was Michael doleac and Keith Van Horn steam that wasn't a football program whatsoever when I was growing up and now it's all of a in this there. Anyway, Rick Majerus. Yeah, Rick Majerus in is sweater. And yeah, I still look at the Utah. I look at in the Council of previews. I turned like the Mountain West and so expect see Utah there same way. Like my dad always when I was growing up. He would always call Memphis. Memphis State is a huge college basketball fan and I all Memphis State this Memphis State. They're like that. It's Memphis. There's no State on the end. He wouldn't understand. I'm same way the Utah. I was like, oh, yeah, they are in the Pac-12. Oh, yeah Colorado's in At 12:00 to 1:00 the hell did that happen? Oh my goodness. Look at that. It non-power five teams. Notre Dame is is a team that I think the program is in better shape than it was a season ago at least entering the year, but the way that the roster kind of breaks down the way they have holes. I don't have good things for the Fighting Irish happening in Georgia and kind of being out of the playoff by then outside of that any other of the non power five teams have a chance at knocking on the door making things interesting and Causing chaos for the for the final four for the college football playoff to you me eyes. Always I think the first power 5 T my eyes always drift toward when they're looking at previews for the seasons Boise State and that just shows you kind of the name brand that they've solidified in college football more Notre Dame. I'm the same way as you and I know we can I'm an ordained fan. So I will say that I often look in that look at them more negatively than I probably should but I do You see them taking a bit of a step back this year and part of that is part of that is reality and part of that is being an ordained fan. You're kind of waiting for the fall back the next year that we really haven't been able string many seasons together that are consistently really really good. I think last year in the year before was really the first time that's happened in quite some time. I do think Ian books going to be good still some question that all of the wine is good every year but Kareem and aqua or possibly the best defensive end combo the country but Cody and tranquil and Julian love and those are in Jerry Tillery up the middle. I mean those are huge losses and there's a lot of guys behind them that haven't seen much action because those guys played so much football. So a lot of questions there, but if there's one team and I think outside the power 5 that I'm looking at the possibly make some noise and people will point to Central Florida. But again, let me go back to this area for Brandon wimbush is at quarterback. I've got some questions with you, but throwing this thing becomes an issue. Yeah Cincinnati's the That I'm looking at this year and I know Luke fickle and he'll be in his third year this year adam-11 to last year be Virginia Tech in the bowl game returning 14 starters. Dozen Ritter a quarterback is going to be a star maybe, you know potentially in like Lamar Jackson conversation coming up as a dual threat Michael Warren at tailback. Their defense is lights out led by James Wiggins at safety. A lot of guys that we're going to that we're going to hear about in the future and they're still pretty young to I think a lot of these guys will go back far enough. Other your next year, so the Cincinnati team is not just going to be a problem this year, but Luke Vehicles got them pretty well set up in that American Conference for the future. They go to Ohio we to but other than that, I don't see I don't see a game at Memphis. The last Friday of the season is one of those underrated games of the year. I think that if both those teams are as good as they're supposed to be and that this is supposed to be good again. I think that's going to be a fantastic game to finish off the conference season before heading to the conference Championship games, but I Today's a team. I could easily see in a going undefeated in conference into that. Memphis game the last game of the year and maybe have a again the problem though is with your if you're a non power find School most likely need an undefeated record going to get head into the playoff or make some noise in the playoff. If you're playing at Ohio State that second week of the season. I don't know if that's gonna work out so well for you, but Cincinnati's a team. I not only like for this year, but think pickles got the talent that program on the up and up and I look for big things. For them in the next couple of years how long you think fickle lesser absolutely depends on what jobs open up. I mean, it's been a launching pad of late Tennessee to really have from their Notre Dame jobs come from they're fickle. Obviously the Ohio State ties doesn't seem like that's going to be open anytime soon. But like that has just been a launching pad to Big Time like and it's interesting too because seeing is that fickle it had that time at Ohio State has to help. Both of fire was out. Does he kind of look at it differently? He's had the taste of the big time as he went on maybe. Hopefully this little morning still young guy very young. That'll have you turned 40 yet. But I wonder if he's going to be more patient seeing as how it was at Ohio State and it wasn't very successful. I believe they went six and six years there, but it's going to be interesting because I hope and a lot of times I really hope some of these you see this in college basketball team college football some of these guys that see success in one or two years will jump at the first power 5 school first powerful. Good job that comes up form and you can understand it in some respects because it's a huge payday and they may not you never know. What happens the next year. So you got to take what you have. There are other people that slow played a little bit more and then they fall into the the good job and there's a really really good job at top Tier 1 they build up more of a resume. So I don't know about fickle. It's just interesting because I think he's seen how it is on the other side and maybe we'll take a different approach to it Jeff. Appreciate you taking the time. It's been a lot of fun. You told us earlier. It's bamas. The rest of everyone is just kind of living in at this football season. What's your biggest surprise? You see coming here in 2019. Oh baby, I would say horrible gets fired surprise anymore. I mean I think fired would be a surprise. I think underachieve. I I'm with you. I think that that is I think under achieve that team has it written all over themselves. There's all this talk of oh my God shape Patterson, it's office. If it's some butter. It's a third offense in three different his last three years playing football. Like that's an Use for NFL quarterbacks, but now it's going to be the Difference Maker for him at the Collegiate level. I think this is a team. They lost a lot of NFL Talent by the way, like I think this has regression written all over it and big-time disappointment in Arbor. Well, how about, how about Iowa's Iowa Michigan State in the Big Ten championship game sign me up for that. What year was that? Like twenty thirteen or fourteen where it was just the pounded out like 14 to 10. Come back, Michigan State win, sign me up one of those. I know that the Big 12 thing. Exciting and I know that the SEC is putting up points more and more. I'm good for one of those every once in a while. I think the West is going to be a lot better this year talent-wise. I mean, I think Minnesota is better. I think produce better. I think Nebraska is going to be better. I think that's and northwestern's got the best quarterback they've ever had at the school. So other than what's not talk about Illinois, but I think the rest of that I think the rest of that division is going to be so much better than we've seen and yeah they may they may knock each other around a bit, but the tent not just The one the one loss record hasn't been the problem that division. It's been the talent. They haven't had teams that you look at and go that team can beat anybody. I think this year. You're going to see the Big Ten West you're going to see a bit of a Resurgence as far as the talent goes in that cop and that division. Yeah. I know that Illinois is seen as a step behind everyone else there. But how close is it 1 through 6 with the other six teams there for you E. I mean, this is like you could take a dart and just throw it in. Okay. Yep. Nebraska is going to finish first, Iowa second and Minnesota third and it wouldn't surprise anyone you. Tell me the Big Ten West could have any I would be most the only one I really be truly out of out of my shoes surprise for would be Illinois. The rest of my could see potentially going to the conference Championship game. I mean, this is probably going to be maybe maybe the weakest Wisconsin team. We've seen in quite some time. I mean Jonathan Taylor obviously still there, but you're breaking new quarterback tongue gone on defense, but they're mean they're consistently good the rest of the team Brahms got Purdue going Flex. Got Minnesota back. I think that it's always come back with a ton this year. Northwestern's all those is always going to Northwestern but Illinois this is supposed to be this year is supposed to be the year. They're competing for a bowl this coming season. So it's kind of put up or shut up time for them. How are you with the state of the line, you're in Illini guy, like stated them state of the lobby thing state of the rebuild. If you want to call it that like, where are you at with you later? I mean fandom included and just casually just frustration just I think people need to look at it realistically and I think loves was a play. I think it would have been different if love you come to Illinois right after he he was at the Bears. I think that's a different draw. I don't know how many of these kids are really drawn to Illinois. Bye Lovie Smith. I was a fan of the higher just because it was doing something different. It wasn't it wasn't a real. It wasn't one of the first time they were interesting ever and that's the team went to the Rose Bowl was look I know in my life, but they were never even interesting. It's like love you at least brought that but it quickly wore off. I was on campus the day that they hired him and for for a work thing and I had to go into a meeting for a couple hours. I came out and the campus was plastered and Lovie Smith stuff and I had never seen anything like that with them only, Illinois. Ball probably since the sugar bowl or that starts at the Rose Bowl, but this is this is they've got enough Talent on that team but schematically and strategically during games throughout the last three years. They just have looked they've been lacking and with the number the number of players you've seen move out of the program MJ Rivers this year, Isaiah Williams is gonna be a freshman quarterback Reggie. Corbin is going to be a stud stud again at tailback. Offensive lines pretty good, but a lot of these guys have been this will be the third year that they're seeing significant playing time for innate last season. It's not crazy to me to see a two-game Improvement. It's not the Ohio State's not on their schedule. So that's a plus they do play Michigan, Michigan State, Wisconsin and Iowa, but getting six wins anymore is not a huge fan and I would I wouldn't be surprised to get to six wins. I would be shocked if they won the division. Awesome. Well appreciate you taking the time Jeff. This was a ton of fun. Like I said, we'll be checking in with you throughout football season and I don't be a stranger. All right, Nick. Thanks for having me man.

But this year, the top-ranked Crimson Tide isn't favored to win it all, according to oddsmakers. They have Alabama as a 3.5-point favorite to win the national title, with Georgia and Ohio State tied for third at 5-1, per Deadspin. ""I think it's going to be a revenge tour that we've never seen before not that they need more motivation other than just having really good players,"" ESPN college football analyst Nick Kowski says. ""I think being handled on the national stage as they were last year my number. Something looking out. This year is is is is Bama is not it's not will Clemson rebound. Are they the new Alabama but I think Alabama is ready to just run through everybody Clemson is typically lost. I think last year was unique that through the Brent Venables the era they've typically lost a lot of defensive players last year. They returned a lot for the really the first time.

Why have you started go now? Welcome to the inaugural episode of the Fortnight drop-in pod cast. I'm your host Dennis joined by my fellow partner in crime and brother a loaf. Hello feather fellow Bots Yes, we're world-renowned on the Fortnight universe as Bots because evidently we're not good this podcast is going to be a kind of a focus look at Fortnight as far as the Esports scene and just our general take on what's developing and the Fortnight Universe which is of we all know it's changing daily. Yeah, this podcast will focus on the week 3 World Cup semis specifically the Northeast region solos Edition today is the start of the week for Duo's. We will cover that in a later podcast. Yeah, and just kind of our general experience with Fortnight. I dabbled in Fortnight. Probably about a year ago when it when I doubt when I found out it was going to be released for the Nintendo switch, which is my primary gaming platform. I then installed Fortnight on my PC to see what all the hype was about and realize that keyboard and mouse controls are not for me. But I want to download it a switch. I got the bug and I've been hooked ever since. Yeah, it took me awhile for the bug to catch on with me. My brothers were playing with it. We kind of play as a group on the switch. Then I took about a three-month break and then Dennis told me that we would the they had zombies in the game in October and then shortly after that they had started adding golf cart. So I played with the golf carts for a little bit then a few weeks later. They had a planes and so I was just Egg to play with the planes and I gradually started playing more and more and started getting a little bit better at building. I'm still I would say I'm post novice but I'm not quick enough to be called like a good Builder. Like I'm somewhat decent at it and that's what separates that's how you get the skill Gap in Fortnight, which makes it really addicting is it's the building because everybody can kind of figure out how to shoot people and there's a wide range of guns and loud as you can do and have some success was I'm dating but the biggest part is getting The High Ground rotations 90 degree rotations and sneaking up on people and surviving surviving is a big part of it. So, yeah, it's yeah, the eliminations isn't necessarily the way to go. I mean there are aggressive players and that's what they like love to do is get as many kills in the lobby or eliminations in the lobby as possible. But yeah, like we said our Focus today is going to be The Northeast regions week three solos World Cup and specifically day one of that we watch about one to two hours of it. It's a 10 hours live stream is it covers all the regions? So we wanted to focus on the region that we would be playing in if we were good enough. So Dennis you want to kind of explain the qualifying process because it gets it can be kind of complicated for noobs. Yeah, and that's one thing I would say either listen to this podcast to get some background on how its setup or do some research yourself online. Because it's not the most self-explanatory system. But once you understand, it's actually pretty simple the way it works is and inversion 8.2 the update that came out a couple weeks ago actually in April. I think mid April is when it was released the qualifying process starts with the new Arena mode and there's no real set schedule for the mode. So that players can earn points whenever you want to which you basically it's a tier system. That's probably not a good term since he was already used, but it's a There's the Visions similar to if you've ever played games like our Stone where there's different ranks and you rank up. Well, there's seven divisions starting with I don't know the exact term for the first three divisions beginner. Is that what it is? The open division open Division and then it goes into Contender Division and you're ultimately striving towards the elite division. Although it's not called delete. I'm drawing a blank his Champions addition. If you get 300 high points, you get high points for high point and you might have doing different things like get it but by placement or eliminations those sorts of things, but you want to work your all the way up to the top division and Arena mode that Qualifies you for the World Cup open online tournaments which happen every week and they alternate weekly one week will be singles or solo. The other one will be Duo's each weekend. Then when you if you're in Champion Division division seven each week and will kick off with the online open semifinals on Saturday these happen over the course of a three hour window where each player gets 10 matches to play Within that three hour window and then the top three thousand players in their region. I will then advance to the open finals on Sunday. That's where the money comes in and the open finals every player will see their score resets from the previous day. And the once again have three hours of play 10 matches. The top finishers will receive a portion of the 1 million dollar prize pool and a few select players will earn a qualification spot for the World Cup in New York City on July 26th through the 28th. And that that the number of people that qualify for region, I think depends on how many players are. On average play in those divisions like you're a nurse the North American East spot as they have they have six spots but there's also the most competitive and the most number of people playing so Europe gets I think eight qualifiers, but that's a bigger region and then Oceania gets to in 86. Yeah. So in a used to is really competitive and as well start running down the highlights of what we what we witnessed. Yeah. And the one thing I didn't want to say is the I don't I haven't done the math, but I'm guessing it probably based on the fact that it probably comes to like a couple hundred players will qualify for the live finals in New York City in July. Yeah Esports are thing that that you and I used to kind of poke fun at but I was I don't know about you but I was completely blown away with the production that they put together at Epic. Yeah. It's kind of hard to do Fortnight as an esport because he started A hundred players and each like there's lots of eliminations early and the beginning part of fortnight as you and I know the way we play as we kind of slow play. So you want to gather as many materials as possible find the guns that you are comfortable with and then kind of progressively get into the circle as a storm shrinks down. So with the broadcast they start off there's these two guys and then I really hype which most Esports gamers are but they're more Of a like they feel like more studio and more polish for some reason. I don't know why that is maybe it's because it's on Twitch. So they're a little more loose but there's the two guys that do the commentating are Sundays and I want to say the other guy's name was Zeke. So they start out the show 24 cameras. And then I said say okay, let's break into the action and so they go into a game and usually there's about 35 people twenty five or thirty five people left is it's the when there's actually action happening. So then there's like all kinds of people all over and they have a they have a my favorite angle was the wide camera angle for viewing players are highlighted in different colors. And you can see the different levels of building. So they'll have everybody's like name or tag on there. But the wide-angle they have them that you can see the top layer of structures being built the middle and then the ground level which is nuts because like people will just fall down and like reset and kind of as the storm gets smaller and it's starting to move and rotate they'll just like fly down hit the ground at the edge and then start building up and it is Really impressive see if you've played any level for light any how crazy they are building and the thing is it almost seems like a different game. But you're you gotta keep in mind that once you're seeing these World Cup semi-final matches where you've got the elite of the elite playing there are typically when you get to the phase where the storm starts moving and you have to keep up with the storm and it shrinks as it moves. Typically you've got maybe four or five people left at the most they have on multiple occasions that we're talking dozens of players, like 30 people that are still left scrambling around and building on top of each other. And another quick note here is in the the world map. If you look at the map each color there each player for the broadcast. They have a different color on the eye of their icon on the map. Yeah, so and it looks insane because it's the overhead view and they're just all like scrunched up in the middle. So many players left. The other thing I want to know is how they how Ballers that's the ball beep vehicle that you use to travel. Yeah, and you have like 200 Shield the use of Ballers as spam is crazy because I'll be like eight like when they first cut to it, they'll be like six to eight Ballers and the stronger player is just kind of Northern because followers are just stuck on the ground and eventually like the weaker players, they'll get They're Ballers popped and then they'll just be like just sniped. They'll I should be like annihilated. Yeah, you can tell once you once you get under like 15 players the Ballers are kind of done. But yeah, the they basically get ignored and they'll get destroyed later right there. Clearly not the elite players are not using those they might use them earlier in the game if the I think that they use to get there. But once it gets in game, they start building and don't the and so what I saw later some of the more Savvy players will have a baller like tucked away in their building. And so when they get screwed over by the storm to pop into the baller bounds over and then pop out of it and start building again as a we're going to jump into the action the first player that they jumped into and I know this might not be the best because this is the first thing that I saw his they jumped in and they were looking at use code Remicade wait before I go with that other things about the broadcast is in the upper left hand corner. It tells you how many players are left and the bottom right hand corner. It tells you how many storms have taken place which is nice because there's nine storm shrinking and the other thing on the user display name. It tells you how many materials total they Left which is pretty cool when they like Bounce from player to player and also has their high point so you can kind of keep tracking your head with a standings which you would think that would be really hard with how many games and players there are trying to qualify in the semifinals, but it helps you because they pretty much only focus on a handful of players, which we'll get to that later you so you can kind of see like who's good where they are and like who's like coming out of nowhere? Yeah, and if some it adds drama if they're down didn't know builds alive to you're like, oh Oh, wow, they needed get some eliminations because they've got if they're seriously contending they need to get some material. Otherwise, they're going to be hurting towards the end game. Yes. The first player highlighted was used code Remy kid. They broke in with about 35 people have to show action. He I was really impressed the way he was editing and he was rotating really really good and he was using grenades which you don't really see a lot of that handhelds. When he was editing hit edit throw a grenade and then close the wall immediately after he threw like it was just insane the speed they play with. Yeah, and it has like 90 degree rotations. We're just ridiculous because you just go through walls and then close it back up and then turn and like he was just like going nuts and then after they got off use could ruin kid, they jumped off to cease 100 t or cease as they refer to him. And he's kind of a stud. He is one of the aggressive players you would say he had a really high elimination count. He probably had like 20 eliminations in that first game. So he got a crack like it that's just 23 points. So he got more points with eliminations and most people do just trying to survive and win the game. Yeah II he impressed me as well the player that I saw it that stood out to me the most was teeth you T Fue he would he was playing The High Ground and then he was able to then he just get pull off some insane shots from crazy distances get eliminations and then it got to a point where he needed a drop down to get material drop down and then the next thing you know, he's right back up uses a launch pad gets right back up to the hot. Ultimate High ground and he ended up winning the match. He ended up getting I believe he had a final score of like 24, which is insane and one game. Yes. The other thing that I noticed is The announcers were hype but they weren't like as annoying as like I try to watch OverWatch to try to understand why that game so popular but the broadcast is like very it jumps around a lot and the screen because that games effect faster paced game is the like there's it almost gives me motion sickness and I don't get motion sickness. So the announcers were hyped but not like over-the-top. I would say. Yeah think they point out they point out really useful things like that. One of the guys was like, The play-by-play guy and the other guy was a color commentator at the color commentators and for that I was really impressed with because they picked out things that I didn't necessarily notice like a little corner sneaky peek. I think seats was the first one to do that where he would put a window right next to a wall like in the corner and just like get people like he would he would he kind of would like he likes he's had like a sixth sense of like hearing where other people were and he would like put in a window over in the corner and then Just like get people that way to it was really impressive. I think Grove was doing that to which I don't have a lot about it, but I know they highlighted him and like one of the first couple games and he was doing pretty well. But I think he was one of the aggressive players where it look really cool on TV, but he got smashed with like 10 places to go. The thing I'll say about the commentators is they were very additive. They weren't just screaming and getting excited like they actually explain the action and it similar to In professional sports, you felt like you've learned something about the game and it made you a better player at least appreciate what you're watching more. Like they are additive. They weren't just voices screaming like he's sometimes the another Esports that I've watched before and then the next thing that I noticed is they like jumped into logic which is a player's name and hit he was like doing some decent editing and stuff, but then I don't know exactly what happened. It's been I watch this on like Wednesday so or Tuesday and we're recording on a Saturday so logic died with no limitations. He got trapped and was kept up by the storm. So he was his main highlight as a stud and got eliminated by being trapped by the storm / structure. So that was that was wild to see you to see how like I would have never thought to eliminate somebody just by trapping them, but because like usually like we said like in Casual games or the more casual less competitive games when you get to like the last five people you still have like probably two or three or four storm resets. So you have a lot of space so you really won't get trapped. But this is this is what happens when the storm starts moving and shrinking like almost like instantly and we're just to give an idea of where we're at. We're you and I are basically about mid-tier or mid-level on as far as reaching The Division Seven. I'm division four When you're getting close to that, we're I said, we're not by any way or any stretch of the imagination professionals, but we aren't novices either. We kind of get what your we get what you're supposed to do. We just can't quite do it yet. Yeah, we're not fast enough. We also play on the switch and with controllers so we don't have when Otto build which I think would come in handy in the lake and the end game as I call it the other thing that okay so jumping Onto another game there is a game which ceases do is partner 100t Caillou Z, which is nice at the commentators gave us an info. He had a come-from-behind win on the ground and it was I did it was so unexpected because he was he was like basically playing from his ass just playing out of his ass and he got like he got pinched so used the rift and then landed on the ground and he was unable to get the better. Our advantage and I think this is the one where he was shooting at the weak points of little cones is what I call him like the roof. Yeah, the pyramids yeah, he was he was shooting through that and he was able to win by playing from the ground and usually that's impossible because if you're on the ground and a very small Bubble at the end of the game people can people with a high ground you just shoot down. It's like fish in the barrel because you have nowhere else to go right but he was able to come away with this crazy win. And also that's another thing that I liked about the broadcast is they'll show you the entire view like the wide camera angle on the left and the final two players in a split screen top and bottom so you can see like what the Everett what the players are seeing and what it looks like if you're just a spectator watching. Yeah, it will in the weight moving if anyone's played team Rumble mode in you notice that there's lots of building that goes on in that mode that's like Lego Struction compared to actual construction. There's the amount of building that occurs is insane. I was not prepared to see that. Yeah, and so when you fall if you're on the higher level when you follow you almost guarantee to land on something else granted, you're probably going to get eliminated. But yeah, there's the way everything is connected. It's like a whole new like part of the game is built which as honestly that's what I like about Fortnight is like there's a lot of platforming and Video game stuff that you've learned since playing it from the 80s and 90s like Granite is in a 3D environment now but like you're creating your own platforms, so that's really cool. And so knowing how to maneuver that and kind of like I just learned after watching this broadcast a better way to like edit structures. So I don't feel like I'm like, I have a better understanding of building the walls and a roof and half a like taking away half the wall and Like that granted, I'm not I'm definitely not fast enough to be like a top Elite player, but it definitely gives you an idea of how to play better and maybe like get a better strategy and win some of these more casual matches. So it was very informative. I feel like it helps take you from that. I mean the easiest comparison is obviously Sports meeting about Competitive Gaming, but it takes it from like rolling a soccer ball out in front of a bunch of five-year-olds and enrolling of soccer ball and in front of them. 13-year old coach the 13 year olds are going to do something that resembles something intelligent. Whereas the other kids just gonna go out there and kick around. Yeah, the other thing that so later they went to a game there's about 20 people left and then I jump to ninja which if you know Fortnight ninja is the number one twitch streamer, so he makes money all the time just by streaming and he's fairly competitive, but I don't think he's like one of the top 10 players in the world. He's just Just a plays a lot. He promotes it and he's like just attached to the game. So he was building but there was like he was on a cliff and he was trying to hit like rotate around and he missed and he fell like 200 feet straight down to his death, which was wild to see because he's very very good at the game and he got he just got pinched and just fell to his elimination, which was I was not expecting. That and he didn't have a high kill count and usually he's known for high kill counts. I think yeah, the other thing that is. That's stood out to me is what like ninja Heat? He's obviously a well-known streamer and he still goes by Ninja when he plays but a lot of players changed their names to especially in ranked modes. They'll change it to like a bunch of ones and Ells to make it look like a bar code because they don't want to be targeted because of their name. Oh, yeah, there are scared of screen watching. Yeah. Well then yeah, they're scared of screen watching and they just don't want basically a Target on their on their Avatar because if I honestly if you're in a game and you see Ninja your You're going to want to be able to say you eliminated Ninja. They'll see when I just seeing because it as a games or ten games you get you ten games. Okay, so there's lots of games that they are able to show you and they'll take a look at five minute break in between like a series of like four to six games that they show you in the kind of breakdown have replays and go to the big board and point out things and replays has it's interesting. Yeah, so it's a pretty good broadcast. I like the white like 49 is very there's a lot of stuff going on and the way they were able to Do a broadcast was I thought was brilliant. The only thing I can compare it to as far as Once Again Sports is auto racing where you drop in and see the actual cars view like the drivers you yeah, and then they show the overview it's kind of like that. Will they'll drop in and out repeatedly or we're like golf but not doesn't put you to sleep. Exactly. And so just watching it just even just like the because that when they first catch up And I don't necessarily show you the best players or the best player. They showed a jump and they show somebody that's doing something interesting and you'll see like a high school level rotations. They make 90 degree turns and they're following people and they like all suddenly like six eliminations in a row and while when I say, they're doing 90 degree rotations, that's also while building structures and going through walls and editing its it was really an interesting to watch the perfect gives you ideas of how to play better. You're never going to be necessarily as good as them but you can mimic them and it does help like what they do make sense but like building an editing walls is I was kind of Blown Away by how awesome they were doing. That is you do that and you're moving around they structures and you'll sneak up on people who are just kind of hiding out or maybe they're trying to heal back up because I've taken a lot of hits and the good players make the rotations. I see somebody that's kind of like staggering and so those it go in for the kill. The other thing the announcement team called the small Shield potions, which is really hard to say and trying to talk to one of your teammates. It's like hey, I need a shield potion. Well now you can refer refer to the smaller Shield potions as minis. So they shorter to shorten it to one word. So that's now in my lexicon. So if I'm playing with one of the guys, we've met actually help us get our first Victory Royale. We're going to felt house cheap a while Mikey you got any many as you got any Shields so, That that's going to be helpful going forward and the next time I play with with strangers or even with you. Honestly, the thing is this game watching the semis you can now that I understand the format of the tournament. I don't feel like I'm gonna go I might as well not watched haven't watched the other weeks each week it resets. So then it'll just it'll give you watching the weeks leading up to the live finals in New York City will give you an idea of what to Ill. You'll have. You'll be familiar. Earlier with the players but it's not like once you get to the life finals as nothing to do with the semis other than you had to get to through the semis default by so they'll give you a base of understanding of who these players are and kind of their play Styles so it'll be interesting to watch. Yeah, I watched for the first hour. I also watch a second our Bennett didn't take as many detailed notes. I just wanted to see like a understanding struck out and the guys we talked about today mostly were in the top 10 but like like this like the top three thousand moved on to the next day. So if you want to see who the top six are that advance to the finals of the World Cup finals in New York, you can go look that up. So the one thing that I thought was interesting is they had shown us like a crap load of games and then they all said and said, oh, yeah, but were okay and is on Pace to have his third Victory rally on a row and they barely discussed it and they jumped into his third one and basically just showed him winning and he had like six eliminations. So I don't think he's necessarily good for TV because he plays at a very but he's very cautious. And he Paces it pretty well to put him in the best place to win. So he's getting he's turning out like victories and getting points that way and some of the other players that like get shown a lot do a lot of eliminations, but will Kane is over all and I think they even said it like he's not the best at anything. He just does everything and like overall like he has no weaknesses. So he just keeps it just like keeps turning things up and also an important night exactly. It's a good comparison. The coolest thing that I saw though that really stuck out with me was like there's certain moves that I haven't seen before. So I saw a waterfall happen in real life. So that's when you're at a high level and you fall but you have a windowed wall. So you have a wall with one punch out and if you just as you're falling if you stack them together, you don't take any damage with a fault. So he did he fell with like about 12 walls leaves and then stuck a platform at the bottom and landed. So he just like that's like basically like using an elevator or a water slide to get down to a quicker to lower level at a really fast paced that's kind of a desperation move because you can really mess up because you can start landing on the walls as you're falling. So to see that play out live and actually work was nuts and the broadcast like can't keep up with that. So A like a glitched out looks like it was falling but then they showed another view and he just it was amazing. to see ya, so I don't I don't have anything else to add based on what I saw in week 3, but did you have anything else you wanted to add? I did have a we are five days away. I believe at the time of this recording from week or season 9 beginning. Do you have any predictions anything you want to see epic add into the game or change in the next season? Revert no, I solve some more things to talk about. Okay, before we wrap up I didn't want to step on your toes there. There was a later in the broadcast after the came back from the first hour break. I think or right before there is a guy named schmeckt and he got a victory Royale without getting a single elimination. So I've called him Survivorman. He's my hero. It was awesome though his it's just because it's Skills were so hot so good. Like he was like up in the corner like kind of thing away and then towards the end of the game. He was able to I think this is what happened. I don't I mean it's only thing that makes sense to me is that he put like a steel stare or ramp whatever you want to call that structure and kind of like box the guy out, but I don't think he was like overly aggressive about it. The guy who was like being the aggressive player kind of got pinched and schmeck put up a Wall kind of in his area so he couldn't get around the structure. Sometimes it's just the moves. You don't make that and then I watched they in between our one an hour or two or maybe it was at the end of our to they start doing interviewing people who have already qualified and there was this guy that I was really impressed with msf clicks. He had really good double edit skills. So that's where you put up a wall put punch out the window and And really quickly edit it to something else or like so he was just like going quick. It turns out he's like a 14 year old boy and that blew me away because he was so good at the game. And when we were 14, we were playing Madden on the PS2 or and be a wife like and we didn't have good internet like in 2001 2002 2003. We probably could have been decent players, but the internet sucked back in the day like for really good esport scene, and I don't know maybe Grand Theft Auto but we mainly focus on like Madden and and be alive but like Madden PS2 era we Been able to win some money. But like these guys like msf clicks has a chance at winning like they're giving away 30 million dollars in prizes. You could probably win if he gets on a good streak you can we like $100,000. So we did he was going to have his college paid for like it's ridiculous. So that's one of my big take aways back in our day. If you wanted to play any sport you had to go to an NFL stadium and enter a Madden tournament with like 4,000 people. Yeah, or or play like Halo XBox, maybe but like still that wasn't that was more local. It wasn't like a worldwide thing. Now it's with the internet in high speed. It's all done through the internet. I don't it's it's an amazing time. We are living in and we're on the we're still on the very very very early stages of this becoming mainstream. Yeah. It's getting close though. Like Fortnight is like, I can't believe how popular it is and it's on you can It on your they said that the one thing we I don't think we mentioned was for these World Cup qualifiers. It's any device. It's open to any device that has Fortnight and for not you can basically you can play on your fridge. You can play on your cell phones. You can play on iPads. They said people on iPads qualified. I was at Best Buy, that's crazy. Did you really know? It's so big I want to be surprised if they had a fortnight branded refrigerator. Yeah, there's Fortnight everything. But another thing I wanted to mention before we like wrapped up and start talking about our next podcast and ideas is after the game ends and you get the because the Victoria happens and so go slow motion and then after that happened, so I said that little quick zooms out the camera zooms out and shows like what like the most recent world is and it shows all these structures that are connected and like up down left, right? To me that was like mesmerizing mesmerizing because you have all these players who are really good at the game and really good at building and so almost looks like like houses and stuff. Like there's so much going on here in Fayetteville has and Brazil like when they're built on like neighborhoods built on the side of mountains. That's yeah. That's what it looks like. Especially if it's if the final area is like a mountain or a cliff good especially with their camera angle. They're real good about like explaining how the trains that's coming up. With the way the storm is moving the really good about explaining how that's going to favor one player over the other. It's like I said the broadcast is 8 plus quality. Yeah, and the other thing is like they're really quick to point out. It's like somebody uses a rift that I go. He's screwed. He's out of materials or he's in a bad position and then about when they say that the player will like use a rift and reset themselves or one thing and these Elite level games is they try to get the attention. Pack of gliders because then you can you have a quicker. Release than if you were using the normal glider, yeah, because it takes forever to open and close where as a glider. Is this really quick and you can gain ground and get on top of somebody if you're higher you can just zoom in get behind them and lay the smackdown on them because when you're using the gliders, the other players are so good about tracking the speed of layers that you need to be able to deploy and redeploy to change up the speed. Otherwise, they'll just You down? Yeah. I saw a lot of that. Is there like a pie in there little Tower and these people are trying to gain on them, but they're having their They're loading glider. And so they're going slower and they're just able to judge the speed, you know, like pick you off. There was one I forget who it was. So sorry for not remembering your name All-Star, but this guy was on a his zip line and he all he had was a heavy sniper and almost he was on the zip line going and he was able to while on the zipline turn and getting a lot of a Nation like right next. This guy it was it was unbelievable. And he didn't even he didn't aim or anything. He just like boom flicked it and smack them. Oh my you got any any while out of the blue prediction as to who you think's going to win in New York City based on your one week of Ewing? I'm interesting to see I'm giving you a 50 bucks to put on a long shot. Who are you picking? I like msf clicks editing skills. Like he was really quick and really good and really young. So I like him a lot. Like that was really impressive apparently both were OK notice that I get Victoria royales like stacking vrs is nuts. You can Tim Duncan's got a lot of championships and then teeth use my pick Caillou's 100 tqz and cease they were just getting eliminated. It's like crazy. So and they like ceases really good at having high ground to like he's very good at fishing the barrel and the other thing is I don't know if schmeckt made it, but I want to see that if anybody else uses that strategy where they're not necessarily good at killing or getting eliminations, but they have really good at editing skills to edit people out of the storm or out of the eye of the storm to their death like trapping. I like he got a lot of them will eliminations but he doesn't get credit for them because he didn't actually hit them with a bullet. He just edited he just built structures around them to eliminate them. So I want to see if other people play like schmeckt and if that will Get you in the money. Well, it'll be certainly interesting to watch as we progress towards the finals. But like I touched upon earlier. Is there anything in season 9 you want to see I want to see the volcano go away. That is a very weird thing that they added and when I get there to the Lava Pits, it's not like Fortnight because The Ground is Lava. So it's hard to kind of build up and around people and All kinds of like landmarks that are make it hard to see other players so I don't really like the volcano. I want to see helicopters. I've been predicting it for about two months. Now. I was kind of hoping that since this was pirate-themed that we would get. Battleship, yeah, so maybe maybe a boat but have it be like corny like a really small speedboat or like a raft hype boat so you can get some make it to make water travel faster. Yes dinghies little ding he's doing he's amazing. They just added an invisible potion. It doesn't last very long, but when you're in when they you is called as chatter Bob, so do the shadow bomb and then you can jump from structure to structure to like kind of like Over around the body and sneak up on them. I use that once successfully since it's been added but I kind of forget that it's there and to use it. Yeah, so it was just added on Thursday. Yeah two days ago. So I want to know if that is in what is in the Arena Battle? So it will be in World Cup. That's the other thing that's crazy is so the qualifying takes such a long amount of time that the game had will change and that's one thing I love about epic and for Tonight is they always make the game fresh. So people want to revert back to a different system, but that's not how Fortnight works. Like they had little things here and there to make the game feel fresh and so it keeps people honest. Yeah, and there's lots of strategies to win. So Fortnight is learning how to adapt to the new mechanics, which is what I think honestly adds to the charm. But yeah, Always going to be a core of the game is knowing how to build and edit structures and use that to your advantage and they had other weapons to make it more competitive. So like if I got a mini gun, which is the the short SMG that fire was like just rapid-fire if I had one of those gotten to like the final 10 of just like a casual game. And a grenade launcher, like I wouldn't have a shot at winning because I would get because that's the hope one of the strategy that is able to work. If you're not that great at the game is you get in a baller and you slowly creep to the final Circle. And then then if you're decent a building you can build up to around players and are able to survive a little bit if you have some of the what quote unquote. Pro players call cheap guns or cheap tasks at tactics, which you can get element Nations that way but in like that like we play more casual so you can win you can get a victory real just by having just by playing slow surviving to the Inner Circle and then having a good gun because if you have like I can run into the problem where I was should have been in the final 10, but I I was playing slow. So I wasn't being aggressive enough at getting weapons. And that's the other thing is the I ran out of balls and I wound up the guy. I got down to I had him with an axe because that's all I had left was the pickaxe and I got him down to 1 HP and I should have knocked him out, but I ran out of bullets. Yeah, but the one thing I wanted to highlight is the guys that are aggressive and get the eliminations. Like they only get to get more aggressive when they're low on materials or ammunition. So you'll see them like get and almost like in a panic we're like, okay, there's a guy over there and get him and they run and get their stuff and it's a high-risk move. But if they have decent editing and building skills, they can put up a wall. He'll up get materials and then go back out to doing what they're doing and rotating around the circle and getting their 90-degree rotation, but it's interesting to see when they like it's like it's almost like When they're low on materials, it's the same thing as when you put a magnifying glass on Aunt runs away because it's catching fire like that. That's what happens in this. So it is it makes it interesting to watch if you have some idea like we've put like I put in a hundred ninety hours into Fortnight. So I have designer staying in the game, but then watching the elite players play you can kind of get Biology is because or you can get more informed about the game because if you're just playing casually when you get eliminated, you're like, well that sucks. You don't understand how you're getting beat so badly. Yeah.

This is our first episode the meeting Voyage of the podcast and is he currently didn't know the name of the podcast already unnamed and and I've got a I've got a name. Yeah, and we just need to see which fits yes best. So for now, it could be called tete-a-tete. Oh my God, that's incredible. Do you know what that means? Absolutely. Do you want to take a punt at once? Okay. Okay. I'm think is it in another language or is this like Latin or see? It sounds French two - always so T ET T ET e tete-a-tete. Okay. I love that. I'm going to say it means like you know, when you like jiggling along like you just like other dogs beautifully today. I did see you think it's like kind of dance. Yeah, like a somersault. Yeah, that's one thing that's good. That's good. Okay. Do you want me to reveal what it means now, or do you want me to save it for later or do you just what are you just happy with the being that I feel like I don't need to know you don't need to learn right? Okay, so in a anyone else You can look this up. Yeah, I feel like I'm happy in ignorance Tech. See it says it I like it. I guess hello and welcome to today's episode 1 this is the pilot episode it is it is the theme for this week is pilot. So each week, there will be a separate theme and this will usually just be one word maybe too and we both just discuss so it's I was thinking pilot episodes. I'm assuming you went along the same lines. I did not I really did not. Oh no. No, no. No, I know. So we've taken different routes and we don't know who like, what are you to everyone else? Yeah. It's only now that has been revealed. Yeah. So I looked specifically at Pilot episodes and you look specifically at Pilot. I'm talking about the area you're talking about the organic and they go Okay, so I think Josh would like to take it away pilot. So you want to go first? Yeah, do you want me to do a bit and then let you go or your me to just do all of yours the door of yours? Okay. All right. So I was talking about pilot episodes over again. This is maybe just taking off one website. So this is one websites opinion of the best 20 episodes best pilot best Pilots, depending on the TV series, I think but a lot of it they seem to relate a lot to best Pilar and The rest of the show the rest of the show as well. So interesting how just met you. I haven't taken all of them and they have got a few okay, I guess you can tell me sort of what you think. So I'll start with number 20. I thought we just discussed the TV shows pretty much Futurama Futurama. I well know. I've never seen any of you never seen. Have you heard of it? Yeah. Yeah. It's the same people who do Matt Groening. Yes. It does The Simpsons. Yeah. And I really like and everyone seems to love it. So yeah. Yeah, it doesn't have any more don't think people kind of like Rick and Morty Vibes. Yeah, I can see that it's well, it's all to do is sort of futuristic Technologies, but the robot they're like right there is a robot bender. Do you know sort of what happens? You know, they're one with the ginger. I can't remember his name. No, I don't have one. So what happened is the year was 1999. Okay New Year's Eve. Okay, just 70,000. Okay. Okay, and there's a pizza delivery guy amazing work. I can't the whole premise is working somewhere HD and it's beat sir. And there's these cryogenic Chambers. Okay, where you saw freeze yourself? Okay. So is he in his pizza as he did you do you literally just it's hot or if you didn't answer he falls back, but it's Chad falls into what closes and he's Frozen. For years and years and years and years and years until the year, whatever the future fantastic so he's he's time travel basically, would you come as time traveling? No, you wouldn't know so you in town. He hasn't he's like stayed still the whole time see what it's like in his head. He's time. So do you just time travel mean? I feel like maybe jump. Yeah moving but not the not your personal perception jumping. Have you mean? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, you know like when they go down on the plate the plate It's like an hour and then it comes back and it's been 10 years. Yeah was out there that time travel would you say it's only that I'm like, oh I could depend there. It could depend on here. We've got it right here makes me so sad. I'm just going to put that away. What the person seeking Leo. Okay defined style. I guess we need to pop out I think. So there's a girl. Yes. Yes for her technically time. Although know if I had not time travel for him to have your dad. Yeah. Dad is home. She's just chilling. So time travel could just all be a matter of perspective. Yeah for him is done trouble when normal but then if everyone's doing it then it's not. Okay. We kind of we can go your lines. So that's teacher and he's also I would say there's a character is very famous. The former US president right whose head is in a jar. They bring them back to life and just have the heads in jars. Do you want to take a guess at? Which u.s. President Kennedy? No, Truman know, why isn't how cool Lincoln? Yeah. No, it wasn't in Nixon. Nixon. Nixon is a famous character makes it yeah it is it is not any of that. I feel so that's number one. That's number 20. They're still pretty good still pretty good so freaking and so I've got You this dog done? Hit me up. Hurry up. Now. This is a very famous teacher is very famous now. Okay and is a very popular now, it's I'd say it's a good one to choose Game of Thrones. I classic which is number 7, which is number seven. Oh, yes. Yes. I thought I'd hit you with some facts, but this is very difficult. So George RR Martin the author of eight books. Do you want to know how much you may even Game of Thrones first after picture made 15 million. Oh what apparently this is apparently is important sources on the internet. So when it first I must be absolutely he must be what's more interesting is 2015-2016, which is when the stats of latest caught up to he made 9.5 million. Oh, so he's making less money each year. If you look at the graph it it's just like maybe the maybe they're like older books or less. Yes. I feel like they're using less Source material there are stuff. And because Game of Thrones has become so big it's sort of like he can take yeah that's less from it. It's kind of bigger than his. Yeah. I know obviously the original series. He probably made that same so much money because of like or the copywriting and stuff like that. But once they had the character number one day, they would call the all the By that point and they could just do what other ones exactly interesting interesting interesting. That's so much money though. It's a long 15 million. I can't even this videos of him when people like one more books and he just post a video of him naked on a trampoline in his back Garden jumping up and down exactly. You just do what you want it to be honest. So he sets it was number seven. So I jumped on Not just because some of them are like like lost or something. So this is the best the best the best the best pilot if you had to pick a best pilot I mean friends is quite iconic. Okay, so you've got friends friends is quite iconic Fargo is apparently being judged as the best pilot. You know, what I keep doing with them. John Watson might bring lots of free math. Yes. I wish this really recently. I have you. Yeah, I think it's very good. It's very good. The interesting thing that fogger does that none of the others on this have seen to do I wouldn't say it's not uncommon but each It has different characters and different actors. What's your opinion on it? Yeah, American Horror Story. Yes, and he's very like unique and I like it. Yeah, because like same actors, they're so good. Yeah, but this is different actors different actors of different carry that story The story's different story same sort of it's just the only thing that stays the same seems to be the setting pretty bottle and the title obviously, I don't know how I feel about is it the same TV show if you take out the actors of the characters Philip such a thing. They go first question place of compassion for them. Maybe I feel like if it's under the same company, yeah and everything and people watching it for fur. Yeah, they they still know what there as long as people still know what to expect from it fair play possibly the fog. I don't I can't support that though is very very good. I think is very very good. I think we watch the film recently. I remember you saying that the that film is basically the first episode of Yes a the first season I think spirits to save they've got the same characters and roughly the same story lines. I'd say yeah, it's very it's very it's very very good. Very good sanding drum be ending. He like into the poster of fish here. Yeah. Yeah. It's very good. Now this one I know is very close to your heart. Yeah, if you can guess what it is. I will give you a brownie point. Be not sure look amazing. Amazing is the number six is very interesting me. Yeah, the pilot was never aired on TV. Huh? It's pretty much the same story line except the pilot was 60 Minutes unlike and the producers said turn is the 90 minutes. We want 90 minutes. So they redid the pilot for 90 minutes. What the heck? So I've looked on his website. He gave some very interesting differences between yes. I don't know why you know why someone went into this was detail. So these are so yeah Sherlock, where's a Suit wow in a study in pink, whereas in the pilot, he was wearing casual Jean. Wow. How does that make you feel fantastic? I want to find this website share lucky emails his brother Mycroft in the pilot and wow. She looks hair is a bit longer. It is study. I mean and then I wrote after that discuss hair. So this girl's hat. Well specifically Sherlock or he does have very good hair. I don't know why someone how someone could notice I notice so much and I don't know how that does that affect the plot in it. I do love shot at a study in pink is Iconic so good. So so it's very good. I just love Charlotte one-eyed anything that I've heard so many times. I've seen it quite a lot. It's one of those that just start watching Sherlock again, and then you're so like yeah. Yeah, so you're always going to watch it die but in person so yeah amazing. So we move on to that was so good. Make sure you've got well a very different very different tone Josh. I'm gonna talk you through the RAF. I've got it. A lot of little stuff it's gonna get so I'm the area of I won't lie. I was inspired to talk about your EF from a horrible history song Classic. How do you how do you say yes, please? What? Yeah. Have you seen in the RAF pilot song? It's a kind of you need to use getting that's very good. And anyway, so the iaf was founded in 1918, and I don't think so. First thought was did they have planes in 1918, which they obviously did that. I was also like did Italy and DaVinci make planes and why do we have the area for and many doors also Mountain a team like the war? I mean what's happening? So the first plane that they had the top speed was 70 miles an hour. 777 some space Museum's the motorway. Yeah, so need to just let me just drive. Yeah, so I think it's that bad now. I did like their motto. Although I think they're getting a bit big for their boots because in Latin it is pair. I do our Ad Astra which means through diversity to the Dolls, which is quite quite. Yeah, but you're not going to the stars at 70 miles an hour. No, maybe it's a name for the future testing interesting. So and also if you're on the ground you look up I mean planes are pretty much. Thanks for stars. Anyway, so the RAF was kind of chilling chilling and then the shit hit the fan. It World War Two. Yeah, so we had one point two million members are so many members rambling in the RAF and well to what the hell so many is because the actual requirements or whatever very yeah, that's very very very strict. So 30,000 now I've been interested to see what the issue climates were for there. But us so many people please. I think they must have let any Tom Dick and Harry in I mean it was World War Two I mean Take away exactly exactly and if of than 1.2 million 70,000 died, which is a lot of people but also out of 1.2 million. I mean, I don't know how do you feel 70 million seventy thousand eyes quite a lot of people we compare that to the amount of people who signed up exactly exactly and was that I always encourage 911 but - it's like 3,000 interesting that you have a baseline compile everything. Deadly thing to be in and at one point the lifespan of a pilot was four weeks. I know right? I was like in the interviews the like yeah. Congratulations. You're a pilot cool. Now your life's wants for we do you reckon they got a party if they lasted like that we find because everybody congratulations try last another four weeks and then it's like a birthday party. Live live like to lifespans now like that like that like that was good. I'm sorry. Okay, I'm all the world war what to Aria for website. They all chant about this guy called Mick manic, which I think is quite good name. I like the alliteration in my name's make Monica. So this guy he was literally a crazy guy. He shot down over 61 German planes. Just a little but a lot lots of planes and he was very good at killing people. So because of that he was given laser light metals and stuff. So there's a thing called being an air ace like a CEO. Okay. Yeah, he got that very proud then okay, he died from just being a violent on the 26th of July, which is the same day as storms. He's worth birthday and also Santa books birthday. It's very interesting. Is a so such a bullet. So Sandra Bullock in gravity. She has do you think that makes it better for then storms? He would just he would just you know, you just feel like he'd be good at almost. Yeah, he's good at everything but I feel like songs about look when push comes to shove. I didn't mean shit. I don't know should get the results so you don't think you think I put my money plus gravity wasn't a very good film and it could be done. Sandra Bullock's piloting an interesting. Yes. I like that. I like that. Yeah. My mom is something something interesting. Anyway, many many make Monarch did not do well he died Arabic and he was given the Victoria Cross after he died and I was like, what is the Motocross like everyone talks about the Victoria Cross? Like what's the dealio? Essentially? It's just the girls that they give people when you don't know a thing. So there's been only about a thousand people to have the Victoria Cross ever. It started in like 1850s as for a law, but then out there's like 1,000 people 628 room world or one I appreciate that. I appreciate that. They don't give too many out. Yeah, I ever Minds me of bronze Duke of Edinburgh. Yeah, it's not bad, but it's not this point. No one really says, oh I got a bronze Duke of Edinburgh because everybody's got a bronze jubilant and it's not very hard to get a bronze jukka better when you break out your gold but when you crack out the gold, that's that's that's more impressive but still exactly so I appreciate that. The donor motivations for some filthy V IQ modulation of chairman. So yeah, so I want on this very credible website. I feel like some of these your customer website and this guy had like systematically got the addresses of all the graves of all the people I feel that I've died who have a trail crosses and you can understand like it reasoning but it's very very very weird that I mean very well laid out he Organized by location every so I can tell you there are five in Norfolk and to in Norwich feel truth. Yeah, that's gonna work. Hey so we can yeah, I could do that. So Victoria crosses get thanks. So the most recent guy to get a Victoria Cross was a guy called Joshua leaky. Good name. How do you feel there's a lot of opportunities in big names would feel if you're a pilot. I'm home. And your last name is leakage. Maybe you should join more of a connection and avoided by listening. But if he's gonna well, I really tried to find out what he did, but it was just like the Army have such like in the wing ways of putting things. Well, I think he kills people didn't kill people or Xavier Village, not entirely sure, but Joshua leaky wherever you are, I think he's alive you should be to the line. Yeah. Congratulations on getting the Victoria Cross. Now this kind of works. I made a very big point of saying that the actual value of the like the metal itself is next to nothing and I was like, okay, thanks. Mr. Tinney. That is it. Is it is it but it's like the sentimental value and then I was wondering just my train of thought how much like Olympic medals are worth. Yeah and The goal that Olympic medal is only worth like 500 pounds that's interesting interesting. But you'd get people paying for the metal for the metal itself the top tip. If you have an Olympic medal, don't melt it out sell it sell it on eBay who could buy them anything metal on eBay. I wouldn't would you buy if someone gave someone offered you an Olympic medal and he said 200 pounds Olympic medal for diving would you would you buy it I need are some Concrete photographic really? I would see I like I wouldn't I wouldn't buy it. She's white anymore. I didn't feel like I deserved it. I feel I didn't personally go to Rio dive of the 200 200 meters that has let's say to her. I didn't win the gold medal. Yeah. I don't feel like I deserve it. People that people came out and be like look at this medal that I didn't win but I found on eBay unique. I think a lot of people would I could see people doing it and I can understand why people do it. Well, you could just take up diving and then tell your grandkids. This is my big middle son. So badly area because this is the pilot. Yes. Yes. Yes. I was very sad to hear that was not a single female in any of the RAF until 1994. What the fuck Aria. That's very honestly George who is bad. So I was looking through the website is all white man is all it's bad. I was like guys, please. It's 4:00 a.m. The Air Force to have their motto is diversity. Whatever dude the STAR labs. They haven't very well. No, it was bad. They had photos and I was scrolling and I was like, oh, oh, okay. Oh, he's Jinja. Okay. Okay, it wasn't fantastic. So now here's another there's a controversy. Yeah, lots of websites try to convince me that Bruce Forsyth that's up in the area. And at first I was like Wow Brucie, is there anything you can't do turns out he's not all sorts. He has an album. He has an album. I could see that he has said I think he's got several albums. Um was he in the area? I really don't think he was Was I like I wear I read like a lot of his biography and trying about like think he talked about if there's like even just a passing remark exactly. He were trapped her in his autobiography something. I was nothing like he had a brother that died in the area. Okay. So I feel like maybe that's the connection. Maybe they would both Called Bruce interesting just make sure that two kids both call Bruce for officer Paul. So what do you Bruce? I like Bruce has a name. I don't think it's used that. And they won Bruce Bruce. I know but he went to school with me. I don't know it makes me think of the trees Bruce type of tree spruce tree and just me and also the character called Bruce. I think it'll roll doll but priests way. Yes, Bruce Bruce Forsyth still. No, he said Arabic. Okay, let's get this a cuz I'm like, I'm sure I saw something. I'm sure it wasn't. To longer. Yeah, definitely doesn't do strictly anymore because he is disease. Yes. Is it because he's deceased? Well, because I think these are in the area actually today that yeah, he came out. That's why that's why just writes about it is about fish because it's not one. That's up today. Yeah, that's true. That's it. I'll just go to handle them. Actually. I'm yes. So basically the only basically the only important thing in the area. How are the Red Arrows? You know them? Yeah. Disease 9y guys just chilling doing some like stuff and yeah, there you go.

I remember one such discussion about Crime and Punishment and my dad would talk about how in countries that had Like punishment that had less crime and he would talk about the justice system and then my mom she would say, do you know how many people were wrongly executed after DNA test?

You know what? Okay. So this game was tough. It was a weird game. Yeah, like we won and it feels awesome that one but it was just so strange game does it? I mean, we're not we're going to look back. Yeah and the record we're not going to remember this one game against Orlando will re only I won at home, like what kind of people have we become now? The Mavs start the season 4 and 2 and now when they win their fights not too. Yeah, but I mean like and in this game they win. It wasn't good enough. I think it's like what do you expect? You know your games that were losing the last three years that is true. Luca was getting MVP chance. I mean, what are we really complaining about other than you know, it was just a strange game like that the magic I was like I was getting annoyed by them like just roll over and die. You suck. I'd buy them because they weren't it's not like they played exceptionally because they kept Jonathan Isaac, but they kept fighting and it's like it's over your season's over. Why are you fighting just let it go? Yeah, they just had to keep on fighting and we're like and then man if they lost this game. Oh and it was close. Yeah. We might even be on the radio for five make a mess talk as if you can just talk over me. It's okay. Were you saying something? I wasn't keep going. Yeah, it was closed because as as buchiach, Derek Harper called him because music got a wide-open three and it almost went in and they actually had time for a tip in if somebody had you know, gotten that but yeah, it's a one point when and I guess in the end. I mean it doesn't matter but at the same time does it matter? I don't know like let's not turn try to make an error. Native out of nothing. I mean, you're not gonna blow out every team like cat the calves. Yeah, sometimes your winds are going to be ugly. What is important is that you won those games and the last couple of years the Mavericks weren't winning those games. Yeah, there were some really terrible things about this game. The turnovers weren't good their defense. I mean, this is the first time the magic of scored over your points granted. It's only a hundred and six and in today's NBA, that's not all But he'll just show something about the Mavericks defense. Yeah 18th in the league and they allow like one of the worst offensive teams to finally get over a hundred points. There was a point towards the end of the game where we realized they weren't going to get stops just ever so we were like just just scoring. Okay. How about we just outscore them but you know, the magic have a lot of length and athleticism and Jonathan Isaac and Aaron Gordon for a while, they really bothered Luca but you know, Eventually, he's like, okay. I'm just going to take over and it didn't really matter. Yeah, I was thinking the same thing Isaac vucevic. Aaron Gordon is a big guy al-farouq aminu know we know him and you Michael Carter-Williams even is really long so hard. Yeah. Yeah, they have a lot of length and they played well defensively and Aaron Gordon had 23 points, which I don't even remember that happening. I don't remember him scoring his single shy and then I looked at the box score. He had 23. Well, yeah. But yeah, so daunted finished with 27 points 7 rebounds 7 assists porzingis finished with 10 points 8 rebounds. We're going to talk about the pores in Jesus Dwight Powell had 12 points 8 rebounds the map shot 43 percent overall 35 on Three's the magic shot 49 percent overall. So again, like the defense is a problem, but I mean, you know, like you said it was an ugly win, but a wins a win. Yeah, they Got the win in the next game. We're not even going to remember and thank goodness for JJ Barea because yes, yeah, he came in first minutes first game of the season and scored what like 11 because it had imagined seeing is a magic I think had got taken the lead up to 10. Yeah, and then insert JJ and five seconds later. It's a tie game again. Yeah, I think Carlisle was saving him like just for that moment because it was at a point, you know in the beginning of the game. And the magic had the lead and they would be up by four or seven or five or whatever and you're like, yeah, whatevs. It's a magic they suck but then it started growing and you're like, okay guys. We actually we need to play here and that's when he put Barea in. I think it's been Jalen started off strong on the season and he's kind of tapered off a little bit the last couple of games. He has I've been playing very well. He's not making the same smart decisions forcing its yeah, and I don't even want to say forcing it just I don't know I guess well, there was one play that Derek Harper was talking about Barea how his patients opened up the olive oil and that's something Jalen's got to work on as a patient. Sometimes he'll come off a screen and it just just pulls up. Yeah and mid-range jumper which is like the worst shot in the league and he just hasn't been playing. Well the last couple of games and I think Carlisle's like, you know what I'm gonna give JJ. Yeah, and you know, JJ is like, okay. Sorry, Jalen, but yeah. To take a spot back Princeton was like dang. Yeah. So yeah, it's and we were talking about that exact play during the game because like right before that Brunson porzingis had set a pick and Brunson came right off of it and just took a shot and if he had waited a couple seconds and let that develop it would have been either an alley-oop or at least just a dump off for a dunk to porzingis. But instead he took it a contested shot. Yeah, we're as it was just a few plays later. When Barea came in and like you said his patients opened up an alley-oop for for Powell. It was nice to see him out there. Yeah. I mean I felt like he deserve I know I did not cry inside. I wanted to you to cry during National things. Okay. Why are you doing this to me? Well, I'm just saying. Yeah. Well you're saying wrong there in touch with you. Okay, it would stick to the mask. All right. We're a yes. Yeah, was it I mean did it because you know, it's he's a veteran. He's one of the boys the last time man. He's the last guy from the championship team and I didn't realize Not only was this the first game of the season but this was the first game since he tore his Achilles Last year. So yeah, it was a big moment and he came up big for them that run I think was really important and then Don she eventually just took over. Yeah. He I think and like Eight points or something at halftime. Yeah and starting in the third. He just took over basically what he started doing is his floater. Yes floater game was just on point in this game. It was going in every time even when he was getting contact. He wasn't getting the call but there was contact there. He was still going in so I think when he was coming off the screen instead of attacking all that length, that window had he used the floater. Yeah, and you know, that's really why he's going to be one of the best players in the league. If not already because he has and a complete a complete Arsenal. Yeah of offensive weapons that he can go to so if you take away his three or if his threes not falling like it didn't tonight or you clog the paint then he'll just go to a float game and he's got an excellent floater. Well, he figures things out so quickly. Yeah, you know, it's saw what was going on. Yeah. He figured things out during his rookie season He adjusted part of his game and now even in his sophomore year he changed he worked on things. The same word that where he figured things out. It's like, you know, some of these things like hardened just developed a strong floater. Mostly he didn't really have to before but he just now developed that whereas Luka he figures things out so quickly. I think that helps him to progress so much more rapidly than other players, you know, so it was a good win the fact that you won the game. Yeah, and it was an ugly game. It was a defensive Grindhouse, but thankfully want it I mean Yeah, and usually could have crumbled and well, it was nice because the same reason why we lost against Portland and against the Lakers is we made poor decisions at the end of the game or we didn't make free throws. Yeah and insert the last one have Curry. Yeah. We he missed both of them and I think a lot of that. Yeah, you know, he played the first quarter first 7 minutes and then they play again and then insert him back. Yeah, and it's like, you know, you just expect the guy. That's it. One of the beasts I have with Carlile will talk a little bit about Carlisle here later. We'll stick with the win Maz when they're five and two tied with the Phoenix Suns. So yeah, you know we are when was the last time that was a good thing? Probably no 506. Yeah, so there are two did you want to talk more about Curry or do you want to move on that'll be part of the whole Carlisle segment? Well, there are two things that we're going to talk about one is Dorian finney-smith being in the starting lineup because that that confuses a lot of like there are a lot of people that like during a penny Smith and then there's a lot of fans that don't it's like it's really split down the middle on that issue. And so we're going to talk about that and why finney-smith keeps getting minutes and why he keeps starting and then also something that that I have brought up a lot on Twitter and that I've seen other people bring up is porzingis involvement in the offense, and I guess we can just go ahead and start there since game just ended and It was a story the thing is there's too many times when he's just a decoy. He's just standing out there and I get it because of his shooting ability. He spreads the floor and it really opens up the offense and it's really hard to complain when you go into the game as the number one offense in the league and yet were complaining that porzingis is an involved was like maybe we shouldn't be concerned. We have the number one offense, but there's got to be a way to be excellent at offense and incorporate. I mean how much better could you be when more of your shots or more of your plays go through porzingis? Yeah. I just think there's too many times where instead of the two-man game with Luca and porzingis. It's Luca and Cleopatra or Luca and Dwight Powell and porzingis is just kind of standing there waiting for something to happen and it never goes his way. If for some reason the extra passes made, yeah for every other But not poor see what we're seeing is when he's that last guy is like the player just decided that time and it's just chance. It just didn't make that extra extra pass but there's got to be a way to involve him. And I know the chemistry isn't quite there between Luca and porzingis, but the only way to get that chemistry there is by playing that two-man game letting porzingis set the pick for Luca do it over and over you remember, you know dirt would sometimes set the screen overnight over and over and over again until Monty got the angle that he needed. There's no reason why you can't do that with Luca and porzingis. Eventually Luke is going to get porzingis involved on some of these pick and Pops now granted to the porzingis play very well tonight. Probably not, you know, he was 414 to your point. You said that he is forcing a lot of his shots, right? Yeah. So there's a few things that I think Are happening and I don't think they all equal Carlisle being evil, but they are happening and I guess as the coach it's something that he should address. So first of all, they play the you know the for out offense where they have a ball handler in the middle and then they have Shooters around the perimeter to just spread things out. Well porzingis is a shooter. So naturally, he's one of those guys that's spread out and it's unfortunate because that means He's not really involved in the play. He's a shooter on on the wing or you know the top of the key and so it's just because the offense they run that's where he is in the play to you talked about the how they do the pick-and-roll with Powell and why don't they do that with porzingis? And again the problem there is that Powell isn't a good Shooters. So he can't be the pick and pop like sometimes they'll run a double pick and roll with porzingis, but he's the pop guy whereas Powell roles. We know pal. Can't shoot so he Be a pick and pop. He also can't be the four out guy because again, he can't shoot. So they're like that's a problem too that again forces porzingis to be the guy that's just out on the perimeter. And then another thing I noticed is that he liked the flow offense. I think requires a lot of movement off the ball and he sometimes gets stuck in just checking. Yeah, he sets the pick and then rolls or Pops to a spot and then that's it. And and the only other movement he'll get is like maybe trying to set another pick and I don't know if that's just him not being familiar with the offense, or maybe that's the play but I noticed that I would say that's probably a result of him not receiving quality coaching his whole time or yeah York in New York, you know, the offense was he just had the ball given the ball let him go to work and he's really good at that but now he's actually has to run a system. Yeah. And the system requires him to set screens to move to be patient because sometimes some of these these times when he sets a screen the offensive player just pulls up and just shoots it and he's like, he really didn't even get a chance to get open like you don't even know how the play was going to develop because the player is shot at so so quickly. Yeah well and it's like we're not dealing ones that notice that even Harper on the broadcast was saying and I think it was in the third quarter. He was saying they they, you know need to find a way to get porzingis involved because he wasn't really a part of the offense in the first half. There was a stretch there. I think in the second half where it was a good 5 minutes back and forth between the mass of magic. I don't think prison is touched the ball once. Yeah, and I think a lot of that is our guards are too quick to just go and Carlisle's offense is really guard oriented might be the often. Yes you have Score but you got to find a way to get porzingis involved. He's not at the point in his career where he's going to be happy with being a zero said yeah, he's he doesn't want to be a decoy right now. He's not 10 years into his career and he just is ring chasing. Yeah, he wants to have his own accomplishments to and I think you should respect that as a team as a coach, you know, don't ask him to sacrifice his entire offensive game when he's 23 years old or 24 years ago. Well and also he's really Good to like you it was like I tweeted during the last game like why wouldn't you want to run every single playthrough Port seeing is when Luca isn't on the floor. Well, and I remember Dirk would go through stretches where just wouldn't touch the game to touch the ball and then all of a sudden at the end of the game. We needed a miracle out of him. Yeah, and he this is obviously later in his career and he couldn't make the shot and it's like well, what do you expect him to do? Yeah, he had Don't shot the ball. He hadn't been in the rhythm of the game. He hadn't been involved. And that's one of my biggest problems with Carlisle's offense is that if you're a big who's a shooter, you're not really involved. You're really out there to spread the floor. So the real offense can happen, which is guards the guard and then the Ali of yeah Dwight Powell and you know, we're seeing is an underrated roll man. He can do it. He can do the same things that Holidays, it's just I think and of course Howell can't do what porzingis exactly and I'm like, I'm not a basketball genius so I might be wrong about this but I think that's what it is. It's just that yeah porzingis can't you could switch him in for Powell, but you can't switch Powell out for it takes a whole Stacie away. Yeah, but at the same time they run pick and rolls with marjanovic with Beau Bond whenever he's the only big out where you know, it's another thing porzingis has to work on is his screen setting. Yeah like He's not a very good screener. Well guess he has a thinner Frank like even though he's big and muscular his frame is kind of thin well, and he's got to work better with the the ball handler because sometimes the ball handler just goes before he actually got in position. Yeah and marjanovic is so big. It doesn't matter. Yeah, and he knows right where to go. So, I don't know like like I said, it's hard to complain when you're 5 into and you have the number. An offense in the league, you know pending today. Yeah, and you know, but it's just it's just something that we notice and this is another thing that we wanted to I guess point out or say it's just like these are things that we notice about the game and we we talked about it because we're Mavs fans and you know, we want to see porzingis involved it and you know for other fans that are frustrated like it's okay to talk about that. It doesn't make you any less of a fan. You know, it's just it's we watch the games. It's something that we see that we notice and so we talk about it because I think I think it's something that should be fixing and even Carlile himself. Yeah, he's got to work to get him better shots. You can't tell me you're watching that game. And and oh, yeah, I think everything's great. Yeah. I know you recognize. Okay, they got to figure this out. Yeah, and yes porzingis shot the ball poorly, but he also forced Shots because he knows I'm just not going to get for another five minutes were a few why no right off the top of my head where he got it and he was like, you know what I'm just gonna shoot it because he knew that if he passed it, he wasn't getting it back. Yeah. There was one play where I think it was during JJ's run where JJ just jacked it up and porzingis was so frustrated because he kept trying to set a screw. Yeah, and then he just JJ Jen. He just he literally just started running back turned around he have look if Jay. AJ made it or not. Just ran back. He's like I'm done that might have been you know confidence and JJ. She's like, I don't know. You know, there was JJ's first shot. Like how confident can you be so calm so a lot of it Motor Vehicles. Well, it was really loud. If you ever played pickup game at a park and you're just running back and forth and you were not touching the ball gets frustrated is the most forever and that's what's happening. See so many well, that's we're not going to Yeah, and your expired registration? Yes, and I think that's what's happening to porzingis. He's getting lost out there on offense because one the guards are really quick to shoot. He's never the last pass guy like it happens for every other player. But for some reason when this the swing pass needs to be made one more time it when it's porzingis, the guy decides not to do it and it's like dude just one more pass to porzingis. But if that's clear, but all of a sudden, yeah, it's they decide to make the pass. I think that's just chance the way it's happened. But yeah, but it's that and he's also never the roll guy. Yes. He never gets a play called specifically for him like a post up. So it's just, you know, it's a lot of things that I think it's got to be frustrating. Well, yeah, especially when it's never called for you like Carlisle, you can't tell me that car while already knows what his strength and week strengths and weaknesses are Five games into the season never going to run a pick and roll for him anymore because that's just not his strength. How do we know? We haven't even seen it. I know in practice they've run it or whatever but for crying out loud at least give a pick-and-roll with Luca or pick and pop with porzingis rarely ever sits us sets of screen in general in the game. It's usually Maxie or Powell and he barely ever sets a screen for Luca. And I think as yeah and it's just like it happens. Yeah, but it's not as frequent as Maxi and Dwight. Well, he does set a lot of pics but he's never involved. He's not true that yeah, he says the pig and then it's really just like for something else that's happening and it creates space. Yeah, it does because you can't leave porzingis. Yeah, but sometimes the guy does Lee porzingis and we have still not getting the ball to him. There's just there's gotta be a way to get him involved in the offense. I think that it would help you and it's again, it's like I'm saying this and they have the number one offense in the league, but it's just I don't know. I have to imagine that you especially maybe in a game like this where it is tight and porzingis is a really good player. He's got to be able to help with that. It's I mean again, it's like it's hard to complain when you just want to game your five into your offense if I get all of that, but this is happening and I think it's worth talking about About well, it's a pattern with Carlisle. Yeah, the same problem happened with Dirk and it was to the point where in post-games the reporters were asking Dirk about it. Yeah and Dirk just flat out said like look, I'm not gonna get into it. I'm not going to demand the ball or anything like that. Yeah. I'd like to have it my hands whatever blah blah blah, then they asked car while he's like, I want a Championship under this it's like no you didn't it's okay. I'll talks you want a championship because Dirk, okay and because Ty Sin, and the players that are on the core mostly Dirk. Yes. So yeah, it's been a problem for a long time and that for man the for in carlile's offense can get lost. Yeah because car well uses that person as a decoy doesn't use them really for offensive purposes and porzingis is not Dirk. Attitude personality personality wise yeah, he's not dirt. He's 24 years old. He wants to score. He wants to be an All-Star just as much as he wants to win. Yeah, and you got to find a way you're going to have to change. I'm sorry. Like you can't go the whole season. I don't even care if you're 20 and 6 if porzingis isn't involved you might as well as trade him. Yeah, I mean and it's also you want to make sure that he's happy. Yes. Yeah, you know, you don't want to that's what God yeah, you want to keep the guy happy because you want to keep them here, but the offense at Carlisle runs isn't geared towards him getting shots. It's geared toward him helping other people get shots. One thing. I'll say is so like last year it took a long time for Carlile to adjust the offense to where Luka was the main guy. I don't know why it took that long. Maybe it took a while to recognize it and Then to figure out how to adjust the offense. I mean that's probably harder than it sounds so, you know, we're like seven games in I can understand. Okay, give Carlisle time. Maybe it's just going to take time for him to adjust the offense, but hopefully that happens because yeah, you know, I don't know. Like I said, it's a pattern with Carlisle. Yeah, he's gonna run his offense and the worst part about it. Also. The best thing is they're winning. Yeah, and because of that it's going to be hard for anybody to convince him. That porzingis is not happy like you you could visibly see on that play. He was not happy and I don't care what anybody says about fans. Don't know what they're talking about it we're watching the game so we can see with our own eyes. This doesn't look quite right. I know they won. I know they have a good record is a good offense. She's like yes fans. Have fun. Feelings and that's okay and we're just we're going to talk about it like sometimes you just need to get it off your chest. But yeah, I like I said, I'm okay with giving Carlyle some time to figure it out. It usually takes him longer than others. Whatever it happens. Thank goodness. Luca is a guard because otherwise he wouldn't have stood a chance because everybody knows Carlisle is offense. If you're a guard and you're a good six feet under yeah, he can make you look like a god so Is Luka is a guard because that's helped him to really Blossom and hopefully he figures it out with porzingis to because I mean, yeah, they are winning, but I just want to make sure that porzingis is Happy it involved the in you know, when games Win It is a rough game and they are down or they're losing I would I would I hope that he would get involved then because he is so good and could really help him. It could be that that Carlisle is waiting to a certain game Mark like 10:15. Games into the season before he starts utilizing him in other ways and maybe just because of the speed of the game getting back in shape and all that and you can see porzingis is struggling with ball control. He had the same problem with the Lakers M. People are getting hit their hands in there and part of that is a result of just not playing once you play regularly with those kind of players. You have better ball control because you know when they're going to reach And also some of the passes to him as I know especially tonight word were not great passes and I think that's again also just chemistry of where he needs to catch like, where is his pocket? You know, how where does he like to get it? I think that's part of just everybody feeling, you know to so another problem I have is curry and you know just for the record. I don't want any other coach and Carlisle, but at the same time Carlisle really frustrates me with his decision making out on the court only because he's just not a player's coach. Yeah. Well everyone he's a coach is good. Yes what it says, but that's really frustrating if you're a player like Curry he started the game because he didn't come out with 15 points in the first five minutes of the game. Didn't see the court again until the last six seconds or whatever the game. Yeah, and it's like look, I understand players. Sometimes don't start off. The right way in Lucca is a prime example of that but as the game goes on he might have come out of it and adjusted and maybe got some open shots, but you know, once he decided that that wasn't working he moved on and Seth never saw the court again until the end when you missed when he misses both free throws the two missed free throws. That's I mean, you got to make those Free throws like regardless of when the last time you played but at the same time as hard to not play for 40 minutes and then shoot two free throws with you know, six seconds left in the game. So yeah, I mean like what was unexpected is Barea coming in and playing great Jackson also had a really good he was a spark plug for a while. I think it's just kind of shook up the rotations a little more than yeah expected. But I know what you mean. Yeah like and and there's times even like Porzingis and Luca sometimes they've just been on the bench. Yeah, they'll go out forever. Yeah, and they have that one shot of porzingis where he got taken out of the gate and she looked confused lately. What did I like but that's just car while he's just he's gonna you know, see who's out there on the court. He's gonna check his his stats and then Linux. Yes. Yeah. So let us know what you think about that. I know other people have common or and tweeted about porzingis being a part of the offense so I know other people People are noticing it. Let us know what you think or what's causing it. Is it a problem? Do you think it's not a problem? I don't know why but I mean, it's definitely a yeah, it needs to be resolved. But you know, let us share your point of view again on Twitter at Dallas who was cast or me on Twitter at enter scores Sydney Myers. The last thing I wanted to go into so Dorian finney-smith started in this game, and we've said it before we're not the biggest fans of Dorian finney-smith other people when the start Lineup came out. It was like what the heck is going on? Why does he keep starting? So I wrote an article? It's on Dallas whose cast.com because I was like, okay. I just don't see it with finney-smith. I don't think he should be playing at all, but not all he's not just playing he's starting games. So I was like, okay fine. I'm going to dig in and figure out what the Maverick see in Dorian finney-smith and so in this article, I broke it down by defense. And offense the first part I looked at was defense. That's what we're going to talk about here. And then you can read the article to see what I found about his offense. So it turns out that when you dig into the advanced analytics Dorian finney-smith is actually a very good Defender which is hard for me to say because I never I never saw that on the court, which is fine. I mean, it's like I'm not a Basketball Savannah or anything. So I just I didn't It but like last year his defensive rating was 108 points 7, which was in the same range as Ben Simmons Clint. Capela Patrick Beverley Klay Thompson and Jimmy Butler's. So again, like really good Defenders. He's right there last year opponents field goal percentage dropped 2.4% when he guarded them which again was in the same range as Anthony Davis Serge Ibaka Klay Thompson Joel embiid. He's also really good rebounder on On par with like Kevin Durant Sharon Jackson jr. Chris Middleton. So like all of the advanced analytics show that he's actually a very good Defender, which I just I never saw that before well made me think of football teams defense that is really good, but they don't ever get turnovers. Yeah, so they hold teams to low points and low yardage, but they never get a turnover. So you never notice really how good they aren't as like there's times where Dajuan will get a steal or Seth Curry would get a Steeler like man, they're better defenders in yeah andorian because they're actually making plays out there but dorian's out there you don't even notice but he's actually impacting it. Yeah impacting the game. Yeah, so and like I'm one of those people which is that just didn't see it. But he's literally on par with some of the best defenders in the league Patrick Beverley Klay Thompson Anthony Davis his defensive rating when he's guarding opponents their field goal percentage. Drops, he's not yanis, you know like yanis his differential percentage. So what his the opponent's field goal percentage drops by how much that's that negative six point five. So it's just like skyrocketing but he was offensive player of the year. So I mean, he's not at that level but he's still a very good Defender and a very good rebounder and one reason is because of his physical tools, so I didn't realize this he has almost a 7-foot wingspan, which means His height in a wingspan, he can reach up nearly nine feet just by standing and raising his arms. So you can imagine in terms of like defending at The Rim. I can't even jump up and yes nine feet is extremely valuable and then he also has large hand. So his hand length is 9 inches Kawhi Leonard who has like the most giant hands ever his hand length is nine point seven five inches. So Kawhi Leonard's hands our own are less than an inch larger longer than drawing it. Phineas myths. Yeah, but when you think about that that's pretty ridiculous. But anyways back to Dorian. Yeah, so I mean, he's got a 7-foot wingspan and if you look at in this article, I also have his stats on like his Lane Agility Test at the draft combine his standing reach. He has a higher vertical leap than a standing vertical than Kawhi Leonard Klay Thompson, Jimmy Butler Danny Green. I mean, he's very long and he's very athletic and so for that reason, He's able to stay in front of either guards or Biggs. He's able to get his hands in passing Lanes or just to to swipe the ball away from his Defender and I have clips and in here of defensive plays but like I was surprised I knew I was never really impressed by his defense, but when I dug into the numbers and looked at the film, I was like, you know what he's actually a good Defender. The problem is yeah. The problem is his offense and I'm not going to go into that here because again, it's like it's more analytics and there's also film here but he's basically like you've said, he's a 0 on all he's actually an egg worse than is your on off. I think we're just gonna have to get used to Dorian starting and I actually like the starting lineup the one they ran tonight and they did a couple of games earlier with Seth and door. In out there, I think it's a good mixture of shooting off and devious. Yeah, so and that's the thing is like, you know, I so my conclusion was like I get it. He's a good Defender but he is still actually terrible on offense and I think they're just hoping he can develop one develop into a legit 3 and D guy and to I think Carlisle it just has enough faith in the rest of the team offensively that he's okay with what Dorian lacks one thing. I will say about him is that He always seems to get a big offensive rebound. Yeah, you just needed one. Yeah, and he did want again tonight. He does it all the time and it's just when you need that offensive rebound, he happens to get it for you. So he is a really good offensive rebounder and just rebounder in general probably because his length and yeah, I did patient I talked about his rebounding in the article because I watched a lot of film on that when I watch the film wasn't as impressed by his rebounding when like when you see why he gets a lot of his rebounds and how he gets them which I explained in the article, but he is a good rebounder and like, you know for whatever reason why he gets it it doesn't matter the fact is he's a good rebounder and like you said he gets these big rebounds and actually so as his shooting is absolutely atrocious and you'll see that but this year he's actually he made that big shot against the Lakers and he had a big one tonight win tonight now. I mean, he's still not good and it's a very small sample size. But if he does get better at shooting which is all they're asking him to do he could he and valuable player Derek Harper said as much in the podcast, I'm in the podcast was entering the game. He said if Dorian can hit his shot consistently, they wouldn't be able to take him off the court. Yeah, because his defense and his intangibles that the other That he does. So yeah, I mean, like I said, we're just going to have to get used to it. As far as defense. He is the best defender on the team. Yeah, and I know I don't always see an even now what I'm watching. I don't see it and a lot of times it's it's because he'll be guarding a perimeter player who's just you know, smaller and quicker than he is. And so a lot of times he does get beat and you see that and you're like what the heck he should I thought he was locked down. Down, you know never get past the three-point line, but the fact is even when he gets beat because he's so long and agile, he can still affect what that player does whether it's driving or passing or whatever it is. He can still recover an effect that player and make a play defensively because of his physical tools. So it's like yeah when you watch it, it doesn't look impressive but when you really dig in and analyze the film it's like you He he does do a lot of smart things offensively as long as he doesn't dribble. He's okay like yeah, he you know, if he starts dribbling it's like crap that's probably going to be a turnover but as long as doesn't dribble, he's he's OK out there. So anyways, the whole article is on Dallas huge cast.com. You can read it. I dig more into defense. Like I said, there's clips of defense and games and then offense and just why he is atrocious offensively so I mean like, We were kind of right halfway because we said is how much of a negative on offense is he is it worth the defense like so here's like the summary as good as he is defensively and the analytics are like is so good defensively. He has a net a negative net rating. Like that's how bad he is offensively that for all of his defense. He's still a negative. So anyway, you can read the full article and it goes into off. Friends, all of that is on delos, which casts.com I think that's it. I mean it was an ugly win, but you know, yeah, it's a one thing I wanted to if you get a chance to see that porzingis behind-the-back pass for some reason it didn't get a lot of love. Yeah, I think Ben was the only one that noticed it was just like oh cool, but it's one of the best passes of this season and he got the ball midair and along it behind his back to Powell. It was a beautiful pass. I if that were LeBron James everybody was in their minds right now and it's like they didn't even notice it happen when I guess because it was so quick. But another reason why I liked it is because he hadn't you don't we would just talked about how he's not really a large part of the year out of the office. I know he had that in his game. Well, it was such an unselfish play is why it stood out to me like, you know, considering the kind of the struggles. He's had all offensively to make that kind of a Yeah, I like seeing that. So anyways, that's it. When's their next game Friday Knicks the Knicks? Yeah, so it'd be a nice game. Yeah to get him involved in that one. Yeah, Dennis Smith Jr. Will not be playing in that game. Yeah, but hopefully the game that the game that they go to New York. That's November 13th or 14th. Yeah, like a couple weeks. Yeah, we have that on there on our list or you have that on your list of the top five most important games this month. That's also on delos. Oops. Guess not calm. Nice. Your face is smooth. I'm smooth. Yeah, so that's on the list of the most important games because obviously and that would be a fun game to get porzingis just like 30 shots. It's just lettuce at least just make them happy. Yeah, you know one of these games because you know, if he wants to have a big game in mud and at the same time, you know, he's not going to really make it about him. No, But he is a young person like that. He's still a kid. It's weird to say that because he looks like a grown man they seven three out there but he's just a kid 24 anything else you wanted. Yeah. I just, you know, it's good to win. Hmm. Try to enjoy the fact that we have a winning record five and to try to enjoy the fact that we have the next best player in the league and weepy. Future MVP the week we in the playoffs try to enjoy those things and just hope that car while we'll figure all this out and they'll be so much more dominant than what they can be now. Yeah. Those are my final thoughts final thoughts game ball member you want to a game ball? Well, I know we said okay, we can't give it to porzingis her Luka because we assumed porzingis would be dominating and getting 30 points a night game. Goes to JJ. There you go. JJ. There you go. Yeah, that's for a if you didn't know there are two JJ's with just in general. It's definitely JJ Barea tonight first game playing in the season and helped him come back from a 10-point deficit three straight threes. So JJ gets game ball tonight. My game ball goes to Seth Curry. I six minutes and then the two missed free throw. It was 7 minutes. And also I Appreciated the two missed free throws because it made the end more exciting and I think he has a knack for Showmanship. So let us know who you are game ball goes to tweet us on Twitter and tell us who was cast or a me at underscore. Sydney Myers or Martin is seriously considered joint considering joining Twitter. Maybe by the time you join Twitter people won't even be on Twitter anymore. They'll be on something else in Marty will be like, I don't do it. Anyways. Yeah, send us a message on Twitter.

With the score tied in the final seconds, Orlando's Arron Afflalo missed a potential game-winning three-point shot, and Dallas' Dirk Nowitzki grabbed the rebound. The Magic had a chance to win in the final seconds, but Orlando's Elfrid Payton couldn't get off a shot at the buzzer, the Dallas Morning News reports. ""It was a weird game,"" Nowitzki said after the game. ""I'd buy them because they weren't it's not like they played exceptionally because they kept Jonathan Isaac, but they kept fighting and it's like it's over your season's over. Why are you fighting just let it go? Yeah, they just had to keep on fighting and we're like and then man if they lost this game. Oh, we might even be on the radio for five make a mess talk as if you can just talk over me.""",0.23430962343096237,0.1589958158995816

It is 12:03 a.m. In the morning, and I'm still wide awake, but I wanted to talk a little bit about. honesty and loyalty and obedience Did times when you know, you find yourself giving too much information to people or you find yourself that people don't listen to you or pay attention to what you're saying and it's really sad and annoying. I have come across a couple people in the last couple of weeks where They tend not to listen to advice. They tend not to hear good advice from Elders or from the mother or from the father. Whatever have you? The reason I'm speaking like this is because these days we have to learn to have communication with our children. with your parents would your siblings? What your husband because it makes a whole lot of sense. Sometimes when you put yourself in a position where you try to tend to hide things, you know, you keep things within, you know things that are troubling you or you know, bother you sometimes it's not healthy. when we are in our religion where in our community of jerubbaal and lukumi tradition or any 80 our community honesty is a big thing. If you are going to be a part of a community or part of an ATR community. You have to talk to your partner. You have to talk to your siblings. You have to let them know who you are and what you are. Some people don't understand the gifts that we have. So what happens is people tend to hide them and when they hide them. To me that's not being honest. When you hide who you are is not being honest. So what I'm saying is if you're part of an ATR community and you have these special gifts, you need to explain it to people that will understand. So say for instance, you have an apartment you live by yourself, but you're setting up your Shrine. You have an altar or an ancestor table or something of the sort. And people come to visit you. Some people tend to hide these things in closets or in a back room when a basement because they don't want other people to see but these are things that you don't hide from anyone because this is who you are. I have practiced this tradition for years and the knowledge that I have and the gifts that I have. I don't hide it from anyone. I let them know who I am because this is my personality. This is who I am I say every day I get up every morning. I said, I am humble Yonder. I have a gift and a special and this is me, and there's people don't understand that my family don't understand as well. But I make it clear to them. This is a part of my life. This is who I am. This is who I Have Become. Let me tell you guys a little bit about my story. When I was growing up, I had no incentive no idea that I was going to be in high priestess because I didn't have it in mind but as the years went by and I knew the gift I have and I put it to good use and and I worked with it. And I study it and did my research as a you know, what I can't run and hide from this and this has to go a little bit more further. And when I became and I better be which is a high priestess. I realized I wanted more I realized that I have to be me. I can't change for others. I can't hide who I am. I can't take it and stick it in a closet or in a bag and tie it up and keep it secluded from the rest of the world because what happens is I'm not being honest with myself and nobody else. So what I'm saying to you is if you're a part of a community or you're a part of a ATR and you're doing research and this is where you want to be. Then you need to explain it to your family members explain it to your friend your partner if he lives with you because there's nothing like a betrayal when people come to find out At the last moment, but oh my God, you're what you're a high priestess and you're practicing this no. No. No, you cannot do that because you either Christian. You're Catholic get Baptist. You're Jewish. You shouldn't be doing this. This is not good. But see people go to church every Sunday and they finally that they're not comfortable in a certain place. People go to seven days Adventists and you're not comfortable. They are either. And they realize that they have this gift so they don't know what to do with it. They can either read cards they can pick up on the energy and another person, you know this a lot of things that come into play. But you don't understand it. But then you find a particular place where someone or a safe haven where someone is just like you and I'm not just saying that just one person. There's a lot of women and men that are in the same situation. So we have to build a safe haven for women and men. To interact with other people who are just like them. People don't understand that the gifts we have don't have nothing to do with witchcraft. It is not witchcraft. It is a gift from Allah fear Allah the Almighty I give from the high higher up. And if we have that gift and it's giving it to us the deal is we have to take it and put it into good use we have to use it to help others. We have to use it to defend ourselves. To take care of our children because most of our children not all children have the same gift as their parents. So who else for these people to talk to rather than people who are just like us? That's the reason why people need to build safe havens for people who have that high spirituality. That gift. Okay, so that they can share it with others so that they can help other people because there's a lot of people out there. Let me tell you that need spiritual help that need spiritual guidance. And they don't understand. So if you're a great on wonderful High Priestess or babalao what by little I do believe that you are building a safe haven for these people to come into your domain your circle so that you can teach them the proper way of Defending themselves are protecting themselves from negative energy on from negative or toxic people. Being honest with yourself is the most important thing. You got to start there first before you can be honest with anybody else. If you have a gift talk to somebody you don't understand it talk to somebody you want to pursue it talk to somebody you want to know more do your research? But don't hide it. You have to be honest. I know a young lady and I've known her for years and she has a other half. It's a boyfriend. I want to say her her husband because they're not married, but they both live in the same house and all these years. She has been a hype not a high priestess but a spiritual person. And all these years she was hiding it from him. She got initiated and she hide whatever was given to her from her Ely. So why hide it and why getting initiated if you're not going to let your partner know listen, this is what I did and this is who I am and I need to sit down and have a talk with you and explain it to you before you can become any part of an islet or an ATR community. You have to start by being honest with people. You got to let them know what you're about. Don't hide these because let me tell you something when your mother had you she didn't hide you. Okay. She introduced you as a newborn to a family member to the husband to the mother to the grandmother. They didn't hide you. The point I'm trying to make is in any 80 our community. You have to be honest with self. truthful obedience. That is the key word. But you cannot go around getting initiated in different things and you go home. Oh and let me hide it in the trunk of my car or maybe put it in the closet. I have seen people and I've heard people tell me. Oh, I have an alter ancestor Altar and I have it in the closet. You don't put your ancestor altar in the closet. I have seen people have initiations in in Ultra and they hide Ultra All the officials in the basement they don't belong there. people has altars for different things and they hide them so then what's the purpose of getting initiated if you're going to hide these things? Again, what I'm saying is you have to be honest with self you have to check yourself that look at yourself in the mirror and say, okay. So what am I going to do? Am I going to be a high priestess? Am I going to be a spiritual person? Am I going to be this or the other? What do I want to do? You want to check yourself? You gotta be honest with self. Some people are just not honest with self at all. They just you know every day every week every moment with the same thing and they just not being honest and truthful. Because what happens is when you had these things things don't go well for you. Things go three step backwards for you every time. To start off you have to learn by doing that self-healing for yourself because there's a lot of self-healing a lot of people need to do before and I believe that people should do self healing before they can become a part of any ATR community. period you ever seen that when you go to the captain of the church before you become a pope before you can become a nun you got to repent sins. You got to do that self-healing for yourself before you can do anything. Before you receive communion first communion, you have to repent your sins confirmation repent your sins. So why not start by being honest with yourself? People should not do that to themselves. Honesty is the key word. if you ever want to be able to Blossom or you want to be able to be that and I'm not saying perfect. Priestess But you want to be that Godparent where your godchild comes to you and say, you know what godmother I understand. But I don't understand this part right here. I want to grow but then the Godmother comes to find out you're hiding your orishas. You're hiding your ancestors. You're hiding your egg wounds. What's the purpose of having these things if you want to hide them? Big ones are your best friends ancestors are your best friends? Because they are the ones that going to protect you that are going to watch over you every step of the way. You want to start by being honest with yourself before you can be a part of any ATR community? Sit down and meditate Focus. because that helps And then ask the question is this me is this for me? Nine times out of 10 you get that you'll have a vision. Or your dream, you know what's coming next or what's going to happen next? But try to be honest with yourself because it's not it's not healthy hiding who you are putting it in a back burner in a closet somewhere. So no, I'm not doing that never. Oh my God, they shouldn't be ashamed of what you are. You have a gift cherish it because not everybody has that gift. Not everybody is born with a gift. A lot of people got to go out there and do research and get people to teach them how to do this or how to read a particular person or how to do mediumship or how to read Cara shells all these things spirituality is very important. And it saddens me when people decide that, you know, let me hide these things and put them in closets and all the no no no, no, no and don't have anybody discovered you because when people see that you have an ancestor table in the corner. They go. Oh my God, that is voodoo stuff. You shouldn't have that not true. not true If they cannot accept what you have in your home, they did then they shouldn't come visit. They can stay away. They don't have to visit because that is your space. They have to respect who you are and what you are. You know what I'm saying, so, please keep that in mind, and I just wanted to come here for a few minutes and just share some knowledge with you guys. I love you dearly stay blessed embrace your spirituality, and we'll talk again soon. Bye.","– A Native American high priestess in Minnesota has died at the age of 73, the Pioneer Press reports.

If you're a second time this month, thank you for coming back. Thank you for talking how you feel. Sorry to thank you for listening to the first one if you did. I haven't really I'm really asked a lot of questions to a lot of people that I buy us some and first off his bloody with trying to talk to yourself and actually hearing yourself talk to yourself. secondly, it's a lot harder than you think to put this stuff up on on a platform didn't realize that but Yeah, you put a host it on another platform and then it gets distributed on all the platforms that you probably heard it on like Spotify or apple music. So today what I wanted to do with kind of give myself an overview of my childhood. I was born November 15 1997. So quite a while ago now I'm 21 21 years old 21 years old and From what my parents told me when I was born as soon as people allowed in I was put in other people's hands before my mom even held me which is just mental. So eyeball. I think it's been ingrained in me from from such a young age that I'm able to talk to other people and be comfortable around other people you get a bad Vibe or sent people to get a good vibe upset people but as a child, you don't know any different. So I was putting other people's hands and I was I was taken to that house isn't like I was allowed to play with their kids. I was allowed to be with them by Mom and Dad need a time off. I think at the age of 3 I went to India. I don't actually remember all of this. This is all memories that then told to me at the age of three. I went to India and I had all my hair shaved off. Don't ask why it's apparently some religion thing. So the curls one of the cows were the clothes aren't there anymore, but I used to have quite a lot here and now verging on board. I've got these Devil's horns in my hair, but I have a luscious beard. So it's not bad. It's all too bad. I have a younger brother. His name is Samir. I call him some like a pet household name, and but if you owe me, but if you're listening, I just wanted to say I love you, and I miss you and I look forward to seeing you soon. It is quite lonely here bangle, even if you've got your mom and dad with you and you're still making new friends, but I'm Coming to Terms of that. I'm okay with it. It's just it's just weird being a whole nother place by yourself. Back to her back to Childhood one of the big things in my childhood that really resonates with me ours. The fact that at such a young age I was able to go to so many different countries and this photographic evidence of it. So, I don't remember it, but I can kind of remember some of the feelings. I remember that we went to Spain and I was chasing after this boat in the sea. I just got paddling and paddling and paddling and paddling and before you know it I'm like a mile out my dad had to come and get me and I was so young. I was as the leather rubber ring around me and I'm pretty sure that boats probably in Africa now. Another point is I think I was seven or eight and my dad is just got this car and we're petrol heads the whole family. My mom might deny it but I'm pretty sure she is to secretly she sorry. I take my bike out the garage. I scratched his car and he just went mad at me and I remember it so vividly because That scratch stayed on that call. I purposely let it stay on that car for like 15 years. I mean it was only two years ago that you got to fix this happen when I was like seven. So such a long time and it's always reminded me that. That car is it's dangerous. It's a sensory overload, but it is beautiful and it is it's almost Perfection but almost Perfection is in the eye of the beholder and it doesn't matter what the car looks like. It's how it makes you feel. And that car just by just by hearing it / just makes me feel amazing. so he got if you actually listen to this or you find this somewhere on the internet, I love you and Please keep the Porsche. One of the other things that really stands out in my childhood is more. Like I said my ability to travel my parents have done so much my mom and dad have worked their asses off in terms of my mom raising a house running a household and my dad's somehow being able to be around as well as as well as work and provide us with a lifestyle that is is confit is really comfy to be honest. I'm not Paul. No, I'm not rich. No, let me make that clear. I am not rich. I am not someone that splashes his cash around like it's I don't know like it's a club. Maybe a point in life I have but who hasn't. Where you gets to your head he build an ego. I want to thank my parents because they're amazing humans. They like I said in the last paper last episode. I'm a product of what they raised Bo and they've done a damn good job. So I'm fucking great. I'm fucking brilliant, but then I'm saying I'm fucking brilliant their fucking brilliant. So we get to the kind of the teenage years of my life and up until six form. I would never say I wouldn't say that. My life was interesting. I was kind of just average. I didn't really do anything special. Did I have a David brushes no idea maybe one or two, but I never acted on them. It kind of just flowed by nothing really happened. Nothing substantial really happened in those years and I mean you have nothing really happened is really weird to say that such a huge chunk of your life just gone but I mean, I'm like I did I did stuff like familywize but In schooling. No, not really. That's very people but I used to hang out with with English guys and girls and as an Indian it was kind of always you with always in between at least. I felt that and you're always like the wrong one side or the other side. So growing up. I'd always been surrounded by English kids and I felt that I gravitated towards them in a really weird way. But during six form that kind of changed definitely changed. So I want to round off this episode by saying. Thanks for thanks for listening. If you are listening if you're not you're never going to hear this and I'd love to hear your thoughts and feedback on how if this is actually any good for you. If this is if if if the sound actually sounds okay because I mean when I play it back it sounds all right, but This is really helping me. I'm breaking it up in terms of like how I talk about things but it's really helping and I was just itching the whole day today of just itching to do another one had to talk to myself not for you for me. Just thinking about organizing thoughts in my mind. I never thought I'd organize and so I actually improve every single one of you if you are listening to just if you've got something you want to do just fucking do it. We so cool up in the hard. Just thinking everything's about quality just do it. This is this is shit. This is I'm using some terrible Mike. There's plug into my iPhone right now because it doesn't work with my neck, and I can't edit any of the software because it's just such poor quality, but I love it. I'm having so much fun doing it. And you know, the best thing is and it's the weirdest thing listening to yourself because it's like the little voice up in your head is talking back to you and he makes sense.

I hope you guys had a wonderful day and yeah signing off over there, too.","– Taylor Swift's ""Bad Blood"" is getting a lot of attention this week because of the singer's admission that she's bisexual—and it's not because of the song's controversial content. Instead, it's because of a recent interview she gave to GQ in which she talked about her ""sexual awakening"" at age 15. ""I started to realize that I'm not who I think I am, that I'm not who I think I am because I'm not who I am,"" she said. ""I'm not who I think I am because I'm not who I think I am.

We're on guys this make it happen. Welcome to our second edition of think big Thursday, and there is no better topic because we are dropping this the Thursday before the end of the year at this point. I hope you have actually already written out your goals for 2019. But the reality is 95% of planet Earth has not done that so whether you are in that five percent that has or the 95% that hasn't I believe that you will get some value out of today's message because it's something that we always hear about and it's New Year resolutions and how I personally think that even discussing New Year's resolutions. You're already losing straight up. I've personally never set New Year's resolutions and here is why the reason why I don't set New Year's resolutions is because well, let's start off simply by looking at the definition of the word resolution and it is the action of solving a problem dispute or contentious matter the action of solving a problem or dispute. We're already losing you're already setting your goals from a place of a problem. And I like to set my goals from the future. I like to set my goals in my from a place of if I can have it. Anyway, what does it look like not from a place of let me fix my problems that's like getting in the car driving with your rear-view mirror. You don't drive in your car looking at the past right? I think the art of having the art of creating a Quantum Leap comes from thinking about something that's in your mind. Coming from a place of the ultimate Vision right coming from a place of light man. What's really possible in my life that right? There is why I do not set New Year's resolutions. I think about Visions. I set goals. I manifest my dreams and I operate from the place of the future and I work my way back. So today I wanted to share with you. I'm going to put on what KP calls corporate Kev and I'm going to break down the smart method of goal setting. I've talked a lot about the seven equities and I think the seven equities I've always used the seven equities as the foundation for coming up with my life plans. My one year goals my 3 year goals my tenure goals and of course by now, you should know what the Seven equities are which are mind-body-soul family friends business money. Those are the seven places. I recommend setting your goals. Also, there's a little bonus area which I just call stuff things. You know, that's where the toys you're thinking about lie. That's where the watch the car. That's super crazy TV that just hangs on the wall and also looks like a piece of art when it's not on my things tight. That's where that stuff goes. That's a bonus area, right, but the Main areas. What are the first three first three our Mind Body Soul Mind Body Soul. Those are the first three years before you're there for your family before you're there for your friends. You gotta be there for yourself mentally physically spiritually then family then friends those first five or where the party's at guys. We want to ball out in those first five. I can't say it enough. I've been saying this for 20 years. How crazy is that? Some of you might not have even been born? Yeah, I think our average The Listener was probably five years old when I started working on this thing called the seven equities and I'm going to be talking about this till I'm blue in the face ball out in those first Five Guys Mind Body Soul family friends then business then money. So now that you've heard me talk about the seven equities nine million times. Let's talk about the smart method of setting goals. When you use the smart method for seven setting your goals. I think that it will give you the ability to really ask yourself is this thing real or is this just some random idea in my mind, right? So let's break it down the acronym for smart. You ready specific measurable actionable relevant time-bound. Specific measurable actionable relevant time-bound every single goal that you have you can go through this process and and dive a bit deeper go on a little bit more into the process of making your goals real. So first and foremost specific is your goal specific. Are you saying go on a vacation? Okay. Well go on a vacation could mean a weekend at the Red Roof. In in Rancho Cucamonga, there's your vacation your next thing, you know, you're like what the hell am I doing here? What am I doing in Rancho Cucamonga? Nothing against Rancho Cucamonga. I used to live there and it's actually become pretty nice place, but you probably don't want to take a vacation there. However, how did the universe know that how did God know that you just asked for a vacation or you saying you want to be in Bora Bora? the glass bottom Glass bottom one of those things going Bungalows dude that Hut that's like my goal right there that's been on the vision board for a minute now and you want to be there in August and you want to fly first class and you want to come up on a super good deal. And the whole thing is only going to be 1,500 bucks. Right are you saying? Well, I want to be healthier or are you saying I'd like to lose 15 pounds or even better than saying it's like to lose 15 pounds. We going straight to the goal. I like to be a hundred and fifty five pounds ten percent body fat and I'd like to have abs like a ninja turtle, right? What is it? How specific are you saying? I want a new car or are you like I want that. I want that new 458 and I want 22 inch I guess on a 458 you can I put a maybe a 21-inch hre. What is it? How specific are you can you See it. Can you feel it? Can you taste it be as specific as possible with those goals when I read more books or do you want to read one book a month as specific as you possibly can be number two, is it measurable is your goal measurable, right? You have a step-by-step process for how you're going to save or for example, if your goal is to save money, but of course you got to make a specific so then you're Our goal is to save a hundred thousand dollars. How would you make your goal of saving $100,000 measurable? Well, if you were to be able to break that down into quarters, then that means that you save twenty five thousand dollars per quarter, right which means that you would need to save $8,000 a month right when you're able to break your goals down in a measurable process you're able to take a look and and I believe when you make your goal. Measurable man. That's what you really look at the whole thing and tell yourself. Holy crap I could do this or maybe you look at me like you know what this is actually actually can't wrap my brain around this and then it might cause you to adjust your goal. I know for myself personally when I took my goal for what I'd like to do in real estate and 2019, which is sell a hundred mil. I broke that down into 25 mil per quarter kind of sounds like a lot. To be honest, and then I broke that down even more and I'm like well, wait a sec. That's only eight million month. Then I broke that down even more. I'm like, wait a sec. That's to Miller week. My average sales price is about to Mill that's a dill a week. I can do that. But see it required me really obviously first being specific and then being able to have a measurable result on my goal. Is it measurable? step 3 actionable we want to be able to take our big goals and break it down into action steps. What do I gotta do to close a hundred million a year? Right? What I got to do to be able to close a two million dollar deal a week and for myself personally in my business. I have a ratio of what happens on my appointments. I know that for every appointment that I go on a percentage of them. I will simply close so I was able to break down my process of how many appointments Per week. I need to go on in order to guarantee. I closed a deal every single week. Well, here's an even bigger question. How many people do I need to talk to on average to guarantee that I go on an appointment housing the break that down? So is it actionable when you take a look at your goal? You want to make sure that your goals and the way that you're going to achieve? It has a very clear plan of action and when you do that and the next step all you have to do is show up and it's right there in front of you Travis and Judy from RK sell a team. They have literally broken down every single street that they are going to be on there Travis and Judy are going to be taking over the Hollywood Hills by the way in 2019. Shout out to them. So if you got a real estate Going Hollywood Hills, trust me reach out to Travis and Judy they have probably knocked on the door of wherever that house is, but they got an actionable game plan. They have a game plan of every Go home in the entire Hollywood Hills and the date if I tell them a street name, they can tell me the date that they're going to actually be on that street. How crazy is that? Now, you know, sometimes we have to shift sometimes we need to Pivot and that's okay, but having a step by step actionable plan is a game changer for your business. It's a game changer for your life and to game changer for how you will ultimately turn your goals into reality. Our what is the our stand for in the smart method for goal setting R stands for relevant relevant are these goals relevant to you or do they just sound like a good idea this doing yoga just sound like a good idea to you. But when you really think about it, you ask yourself. You know what I'm just not gonna do yoga. It's just not my thing. You know. I'm trying to get myself to set the goal. Of completing a triathlon, but the reality is I just cannot first of all, I ain't rocking Speedos and second of all, I just don't like to swim. I've got a thing about the ocean for starters and even if I don't have to do my Triathlon in the ocean, which I'm know I'm going to but I know some of them they are and lakes. I don't know man. I just the idea of swimming is I'm having a very difficult time with that goal because Being relevant to me. So I'm working through that when I thought about running and my goal of doing the 5K a day for a hundred days in a row. I've had a lot of fulfillment from running and I've had some really great experiences and running around my first marathon with my mom and a group in Seattle, and it was just a really great memory. And so when I thought about and then also every Thanksgiving Even day for like eight years. I always race my stepdad James and the Dana Point Turkey Trot and he beat me for like seven years in a row and last year. I'm like, you know what this old man James my step-dad is like 300 years old and he looks like Thor for some reason he's a freak of nature and he has destroyed me year after year and I was fed up man last year. I said I am going to be James and I finally did it last year. But you know, I've had all these experiences with running. So when I thought about doing the 5K had a hundred a challenge, I'm like man. I'm about this. This is relevant to me. I want to do this a lot and I have a lot of goals with buying income property that's relevant to me. Right? I'm into that. I'm into real estate. I get approached all the time by other people and their goals and the reason why I don't take them on and It might be this crazy thing and all you can invest in this CBD thing. It's a next big thing. I get it CBD world's blowing up. It's just not relevant to me. I cannot get anywhere close to it. It's just it's just not my thing. It's not relevant to me. So remember make sure that your goals are relevant to you. They get your heart beating and it makes sense to you and you're not doing them for anybody else but yourself. And lastly time Bound for 2018. I set a big goal for something and I didn't achieve it. I achieved like 70% of it. And the reality is I did not make when I look at why I didn't achieve that goal and I look at was it specifically allows specific. Was it measurable? Yes, but here's the thing. I didn't measure it step by step was it in it was it actionable the big vision of it was but I didn't Eight smaller steps. Was it relevant? Yes, was it time-bound? Yeah. I wanted to achieve something by the end of the year, but what would have been better is if I broke this thing down month by month? So when I think about time-bound going into 2019, I think what's very valuable is to take all of these things and review them step-by-step. I promise you guys you can use the smart method throughout any of your goals and it will be highly instrumental as especially if you have a group of other people you're of you're reviewing them with so again use the smart method as you set your 2019 goals specific measurable actionable relevant and time-bound. Thank you guys so much for tuning into this if you got something from it take a screenshot. Tell me what stood out for you KP and I are committed to bringing you something that we're taking on in our own lives right now, and this is exactly what we are doing on. Path to creating the most legendary 2019 of all time. So thank you guys in advance for sharing the message. We are out of here. Happy New Year. Let's make it happen. We're out. Peace.","– If you're like a lot of Americans, you've probably made a New Year's resolution to get in better shape or lose weight. Or at least, that's what a lot of people do.

In our business, he got the very first interview with OJ Simpson after he was acquitted a double murder long before Gayle King, and yes, we'll be talking about her in a moment. He grilled are Kelly in an interview that still to this day resonates and it was right after the tape surfaced of our Kelly urinating on the young woman after that became public Ed. Gordon is one of the finest journalist ever produced and he's got a new book out right now called conversations. Black where he talks to some of the most important and influential thought leaders Stacey Abrams Angela ride Charlamagne Tha God Killer Mike TI and even yours truly. I don't know. Maybe it's Detroit. We just produce some incredible journalists because it also is from yes, the three one three anyway enough rambling for me coming up next your favorite journalist. Favorite journalist it Gordon on Jamel Hill is unbothered. So I have to say it you're the first guest I've ever had on this show that this particular thing on your resume. I'm sure nobody else that I interview will have this on a resume and shout out to one of my producers for finding this beautiful nugget tidbit this tidbit and circle the word beautiful because in 1996 you were on people's most beautiful or named one of the 50 Most Beautiful People by people. Yeah, man. That's a hell of a no. I really didn't it really they were at 49 and they were tired and they were just like who can't just happened to be there. There's like do you mind if we put you on this you're a serious journalist. You have been your significant thought leader critical thinker you gotta Flex on them by being out of 50 moles 50 Most Beautiful People. I mean look you can be on worse, right? I get a lot of journalists. They can say that Beyond worse. So I'm just curious when you were told you were going to be named. This list. What did you think? You know what I don't honestly think much about that. I mean, I know people always talk about their looks and they try to downplay it. But for me, I just didn't think much of it. Now my friends dog. Oh, I was a I know you right rotate. Yeah, in fact the woman from people called a friend of mine and wanted to get some information on me, you know, his wife answered and it was a woman and so she said calling for this person. And he said my wife jumped on me and said don't be having your girlfriend's call put the Eddie in this stuff it up. I mean, it was crazy. It was crazy. But I appreciate it and needless to say. Well I had to laugh a little bit because I didn't know it was just the description of it like it was just so cool. Just going somewhere else the Dapper 35 year old Detroit. There was like he's the eyes come from his mother Jimmy a Lena Horne, look-alike his six to a hundred eighty pound frame from his late father Ed a long jump gold medalist it like they just they really want to give people a picture. So I'm not 3508 180 whatever anymore. You know, my eyes are still green. Oh, that's about all I got left and you don't have as they called it. They described it the Clark Gable mustache. No have that all my see more. Yes. I was like isn't this funny? But no. Thank you. For joining me and we'll like pivot to a more serious conversation, even though I have some more fun stuff to ask you but speaking of conversations your book that you have out right now, which I'm very honored to be in I was one of a bunch of different people that you spoke to for this about critical conversations taking place in the black community. The name of the book is called conversations in black and you have some and again amazing people are here from Al Sharpton back. Seen Waters Charlemagne Stacey Abrams DL Hughley again myself to run a bird. I mean just a really cross section wide range of people. So what inspired you to do this to do this, you know conversations for me has been the thing that I kind of made my career on everybody knew me for doing interviews and I had a show called conversations with that Gordon where I did a lot of the quote-unquote famous interviews, I've done over the years and so I wanted to and as you know, you know some of Most interesting conversations you have is when the red light on the camera goes off for the microphones are turned off and then people kind of ease up and tell you what they really feel. And I said man, I really want to have those conversations and share them with people if I could and I said wouldn't it be great if I could get the people I have connection with in one room and one time and I knew that would be impossible with the caliber of folk we were going after so I said, we'll look I'll be the linchpin and I'll write it as if we were all in. One room. I got the idea in 2012. Trayvon had just been killed Obama was going into second term. I had started to do some of the interviews for that book and and look how eight years makes a difference Bill Cosby was one of the people I interviewed Maya Angelou was still with us. I interviewed her for the book and I had begun and then I got a TV project had to lay this down and then I looked at the world and I said, let me let me pick that idea up again. I still love the idea. So I went to 40 plus people that I thought would have something to say and that I thought were influencing the way Black America is shaping itself. And so each chapter is a different topic and I was and thank you. I was very blessed to have you know, again Harry Belafonte TI Killer Mike Michael Eric Dyson, April Rain who started Oscar so white, I mean the list goes on and on and on but you You know, everybody was very candid and I appreciate it. So what as you were thinking about people that you wanted to include in the type of conversations that you wanted to have? You know, what were some of the things maybe you wound up learning from people or learning just through the process of writing this book that you will you know, that will be permanent takeaways for you know for me. It's just a thing of Black America has always been in this kind of, you know, we're making progress we're making progress, but we ain't quite there yet. We And I'm tired of that conversation when we going to be there, right? I mean, I'm 59 now and I've heard that my entire life and we have made progress. There's no question about that. But I want us to start having conversations that move us to action below items and really start moving us to some of the things we talk about all the time. How long we going to talk about the wealth Gap how long we going to complain about Oscars being so white and knowing that it's a white institution of votes on them. So, I mean we can continue to get caught up in that and look if I'm a black actor. I understand why I want an Oscar. I'll go ask for more money. But as a fan, I don't give a damn if you get the little statue or not. I was talking to Omari Hardwick one day and he was talking about you know ghosts and what that's meant to him and all of that and and I knew that he was I don't know that he would admit this. I hope I'm not telling Tales out of school, but I know he's been a little disappointed not to get an odd for an Emmy, right and Black America loves that character not told him. I said dude, don't let that bother you right the people that you An out there to make this for love your character in the fact that the Emmys don't see that shouldn't really get you down. You should move on and know that you've made an impact with that character and we've got to start to understand that, you know, you don't have to be blessed by white folk to be good and we're still kind of hung up on that right? And so I wanted us to have those kinds of conversations. I wanted it to read. Where was it to political you didn't have to be wonky to get it. I wanted to talk about things like, you know, Oh the images of Black America. I called that chapter the Madea dilemma. I wanted to talk about black girl magic and and to be honest about that. Not every black woman is Olivia Pope and some black women are still having issues and we need to make sure that we you know deal with that we talk about black men and the impact Nipsey Hussle had and I would have never guessed prior to his death the impact that Kobe Bryant had on black men is extraordinary. I mean just extraordinary, so these Conversation we talked about black leadership and we're real about black leadership. We didn't just go. Oh everybody's doing a great job, you know because when when you're in the kitchen at the barbecue around the Thanksgiving dinner table, we don't think that every black leaders doing their thing. So I wanted this book to be that it's funny because I think from a media standpoint and even sometimes the way we talk about each other is that we keep saying we're not a monolith, but we talk about ourselves as if we are. And so I think one of the my major takeaways from this book was the very nuanced conversations that were happening because a lot of times our conversations aren't appreciated for being that like, we're all very different and we have different perspectives opinions viewpoints that shaped how we think and feel about the world so that to me comes across real strongly in this book. It's a diversity of black opinion critical opinion. I talked about the idea that we say, we're not a monolith, but we have majority thought in our community. Right, if you like pumpkin pie, you got hard way to go at a Thanksgiving table. I mean, let's be real you should be talked about it, you know, if you new friends, you know more than you knew black programming they living think you know living single is a great example because they were up against one another right? So if you went to work and you knew what Ross and I didn't watch it Ross and whatever. The rest of them were you know, but you didn't know what Khadija was doing. Then that's a problem. Right? So we get into that and I think we've got to be honest. There's a chapter called am I black enough for you? Right? So this this whole Black Card thing, right who says what authentically black is and being light with light eyes. I've had to deal with that my entire life and anybody who knows me. I will put a dollar to a doughnut that you'll Did hard to find a bigger n-word to me but most people would never never never believe that never believe that but I say if it's color. I also know that you're from Detroit. I am thinking all night. And as I sell people look at a from the way from the rap, you ain't from the rap Hood you from the fucking real here and you don't grow up in that City and not understand some people don't people who've never been Detroit hear about it, but you really write real but I say if it's color then are you telling me that? That Clarence Thomas is black and Louis Farrakhan. I don't think so. So these are the conversations I wanted to get into. Well you get into them and I think it's in a way where it is an entry point for everybody that you don't that look there's as you point out there are some of us that are critical of certain black leaders you have in this book, but if you say are not on the same page with them, it's so many other people that are adding to this conversation. That's what I think makes it special you brought you brought him up a second ago, obviously right now we're taping this. Cast in Los Angeles where this community is still very much reeling the whole world is but still very much reeling from the death of Kobe Bryant obviously now the conversation has shifted and everybody's looking at gil King all kind of sideways Gayle King recently had an interview with Lisa Leslie who had not spoken about her relationship with with Kobe in the wake of his passing. They were good friends somebody that she looked up to in terms of as a basketball player, but just You know also just as a person like they had a really close relationship. So the gist of this of the interview was supposed to be about their relationship. And of course one of the questions Gayle King asked was how Lisa Leslie could reconcile the fact that somebody that she had a relationship with also have been accused of rape matter of fact, let's hear a little bit of that interview and then I'll ask you and for your reaction to this controversy after we hear it. It's been said that His legacy is complicated because of sexual assault charge which was dismissed in 2003-2004. Is it complicated for you as a woman as a WNBA player? It's not complicated for me at all. Even if there's a few times that we've been at a club at the same time. Kobe's not the kind of guy never been like, you know least go get that girl or tell her or send her this I have other NBA friends that are like that Kobe's he he was never like that. I just never see I have ever seen him being the kind of person that would be do something to violate a woman or be aggressive in that way. I that's just not the person that I know but Lisa you wouldn't see it though as his friend. You wouldn't see it. And that's possible. I just it's just I just don't I just don't believe that and I'm not saying things didn't happen. I just don't believe that things didn't happen with force. Is it even a fair question to talk about it? Considering he's no longer with us. That it was resolved or is it really part of his history? I think that the media should be more respectful at this time. It's like if you had questions about it, you've had many years to ask him that I don't think it's something that we should keep hanging over his legacy. I mean it went to trial yet was a case is it was dismissed because the victim in the case refused to testify so it was dismissed and I think that At that's how we should leave it. So what happened after this was that Snoop Dogg had a very strong response. He call Gayle King everything but a child of God and now everybody's trying to cancel Gayle King as you mention it. I remember I grew up watching you you have sat down with some of the biggest names some of the most controversial people because we don't talk about your interview with our Kelly as well. So you've been in jail Kings position. What did you think about her asking the question? And what did you think about the So let me be transparent and say that I reached out to Gail the day it happened because I thought man you taking a lot of fire here. I mean a whole lot of fire. I would not have asked that question in that segment because I didn't think it was the appropriate segment to do. So, I think it's a fair question if you were doing an hour on Kobe Bryant's life, right because that's a chapter in his life whether you think him innocent or guilty. He still went to trial it was Smith she didn't come excetera Etc. So you can't erase that portion of it if you're talking about his life. I just thought Wrong segment to do it in if I'm just sitting across from you. It's not like Lisa was there that night it's not like she had any direct connection to Colorado and the things that went on there and I'll be honest. I think the wounds are still very raw. And so if you were going to do that, I think there's some questions you have to ask yourself and independent of that. I just as a producer would not have put that in that particular segment. I think that's where she went wrong. I don't think she had any malice. I don't believe that I don't believe she was trying to you know, dog a black man. Now you can argue whether or not the media in general not gay but the media in general has been fair to black men and how they paint it Cosby and R.Kelly versus Matt Lauer and and anybody else that you know, Harvey Weinstein anybody else who comes to the table? I think it has not been even-handed right, but I think That you can deal with Gail from a family perspective family and quotes. I don't think the way that a lot of people did it was the appropriate way and I tell you what, you know, we can't talk about black women being our queens and all this and then be okay with the language that was used whether you thought she was wrong or not. I mean, you know, I was like and I'm not approved. I'm you know, but that was rough. Yeah. And that's you know, I don't I think you and I have very similar thoughts about that. I would it was funny because I was asked this question and I didn't have the not at all the relationship that Lisa had with Kobe he and I were friendly we had a rapport when I was at ESPN. I interviewed him several times. We did a one-on-one for BET Awards weekend, so I have gotten to know him, you know a little bit and so I was asked that question repeatedly. And somebody brought this up and I think it's a fair question. Why are only black women being asked this question like generally speaking and this is where I think I would I agree with you is like the response to that and I love Snoop. He's one of my favorite people he has been on this podcast, but the way he responded to that and I get he's emotional and he's a big Laker fan and Kobe was a friend of his but he literally sic the dogs on their own Gayle King and it's like any study that you Little shows that of all the ethnicities between both genders black women get it the worst when it comes to social media harassment threat, we get it the worst and so you basically even though you may have been using kind of Common Language by saying pull up. It's some people out there that take that shit literally. Yeah and like will roll up on getting that was the fear and that was it that was the fear and she was frightened and and justifiably so because you know, we use language so So loosely and we assume that everybody who's listening has, you know, all of the chairs on the front porch, but that is not the case sometimes and so I think we've got to be careful and and then there is just this sense of you know again, and we talked about it quickly in the book this whole sense of respect for women in general black women specifically and though we like to talk about it up front as if everybody, you know respects and loves black women. That isn't always the case. In our language and in the media certainly and so I think we've got to be very careful again. If you had issue that's not to say that you can't address that issue and certainly somebody like Snoop could get to Gayle King, you know, so there was a way to say Hey, you know, even a way publicly to say that's not the best way to go. I don't think that you know, CBS AR Gael may be handled it the best way they could have but again, that's what I think personally but you know, I think that what we need to take away from this which a lot of people aren't talking enough about is the growth I saw in Kobe Bryant I of all the people I've interviewed. I've never interviewed Kobe only met him once which struck me as I thought about it and the time I met him we did not have a great conversation because it was around the time the Colorado trial was going on. So we were talking about Possibly talking and I mentioned the people that I had talked with in these kinds of situation and he took offense to one of the people that I mentioned not talk to which was OJ Simpson. He's like, I know oh Jason I was like dude, I'm not comparing you. I'm just telling you like I who I do this, huh? Yeah, right. Yeah, and that's the only conversation that I have face-to-face with him. I'm a Pistons fan, so I didn't like him as a player in that sense, but Here's what I loved about him. I saw a tremendous growth in a man. Not just a basketball player. I watched him go from kind of irascible cat that a lot of teammates didn't like to somebody who Not only was one of the greatest to ever play the game but became one who shared knowledge and, you know became a better teammate and then specifically for me because I'm so close to my daughter. I watched him become a great father and and not hide it or not. Keep it private that he publicly said hey, you know, I am a father two daughters and I loved every minute of it. And so I let the Laker thing go, you know, I let our running go I let go and I appreciate it. And this was before the tragedy. I just appreciate it that you know, here's a man that I could say, you know, we all should aspire to grow. Row, right and they people talk about his second act but I don't think about the business side of his second act. I think about the personal side of his second act. You know, I've talked to a number of Lakers who said to me he grew because they watched him kind of build a wall around himself in the beginning and people couldn't penetrate that wall and he later became this dude that as we see not only touched lives, but I mean moved people to a point.A nation grieved and so you got to appreciate that. Yeah. I was also somebody who what I appreciated about him is that he because he wanted to open up more he wanted to learn more to like he was he would be the type of person that would be in a room with you or with several people and he'd ask everybody how they do their job and everything about their job because it felt like he was a computer always downloading and I told the story before on the podcast and I wrote about it when I wrote a piece about him. For the Atlantic is that it was amazing to me that our relationship started from disagreement because of those comments. He made about Trayvon Martin, which I thought were tone deaf. And so because of that, you know, usually no situations an athlete or a public figure they'll be mad at you as a journalist and never say anything ever. He was like he hit he slid in them DM's. I was like, I'm gonna need you to call me after the show he and I had never had a conversation ever. And so I called him we talked. An hour underhooks to his perspective. He understood mine of which I did not change just because I was talking to him. I was like, hey, man, you missed it on that one. You know, these you talking about some parents whose son was killed. He was going to the store to get snacks George Zimmerman was looking for something else and there is no to me there is nothing that could have happened in that confrontation that ever would make that right and so to see him go from that and those comments that he made Need to then going to Trayvon Martin's rallies, you know at the request of his parents and him and Vanessa hanging out with them and you know him becoming really more immersed. I think in Black issues. I think it's fair to say but that's what the book to do. What you just did there was a conversation that you had with him that opened his mind and so for me and said we should note that sybrina Fulton trayvon's mom is in this book and that's part and parcel of why I wanted the book to be a conversation. Because I think sometimes people go here a speech or they just read something to see a sound bite on TV. They listen to it, but it doesn't resonate in the same way that if we have exchanged you were able to say to Kobe. Hey, man, you know kind of take a look at this broader aperture, you know, really look at what this is and I would suspect that it touched something in him and he was able to see that and so, you know, I think we need more of that, you know, you can't just be that this is the only way Way and if it ain't that way, you ain't black. Well, okay, cool. Well, that's the thing. That's kind of disappointing to wear. This Gayle King conversation has gone is that now her and by extension Oprah got drugged up in Texas Summers up and like damn I wasn't doing shit at a sudden, you know, it's it's it's all this conversation about her suddenly. It becomes Oprah and Gayle hate black men and it's like man, we got to stop immediately when we disagree that we have to immediately stop. Doing this black litmus test Michael Eric Dyson. I talked about it. I know he is in the book to it's like we talked about that like we can't be every time we disagree. Everybody can't be a sellout but but let's be real that's sense of who Oprah is to a fair number of black people. I won't say many or most but a fair number is real to Black Folk, you know for his beloved is she is by especially black women in so many corners. There are some people who still and have felt like this from the day she she came on they say she touched that white woman. She don't touch no black woman when she doesn't get me stuff like that. I don't like really dude. That's what we're looking at here. I like they just forget about the millions. She gave them or house. I'm like, holy Christian. We don't look at those kinds of things enough and we don't explore them enough, right? So we have them again behind closed doors as opposed to saying. Okay, let's look at this this whole sense of canceled culture. That's stupid. You can't cancel somebody you can disagree with them. You should have some conversation. She can't cancel. Little but you know we bought into this like it's real. Yeah, you know now we know to me if y'all can't even cancel Donald Trump. I don't hear about nobody a chance so that like whatever along those same lines though you I mean and I think we saw this with Gail is that but you as a journalist for years were able to balance and navigate this navigating as crazy as it may sound your Blackness with being a journalist, right? And again, you have sat down with some Re you know controversial figures you sat down with a lot of great people, but I'm wondering for you how you were able to seemingly navigate that so well because they're like, we're still black at the end of the day even though we're journalists. So how are you able to do that? So successful couple of people have said that to me and I never really really thought about it. But as I've you know been doing the interviews with the book A couple of people have said to me. Hey, you know why we appreciated you so much is that you are authoritative like a news person who You were black enough for us. You know, you never let that black thing going. So for me. I've always felt like well, I was black before I became a journalist, right? I was born black. I wasn't born a journalist. And again, you know, we laugh and tease about Detroit but there there's something about being born in Detroit. There's a pride in being black. You know Detroit was one of those cities that really was on the for of electing black Mayors and there was a sense of you know, what Motown was and there was a sense of empowerment of black people and so for me, I can remember being at NBC and watching some of the black reporters who didn't want to do black stories because they didn't want to get pigeonholed and I thought you already that, you know, when they when they walk in they see that you are black. They don't think oh, no, there's a reporter they see you as a black reporter. And so I was the opposite. I always wanted to do black stories and I wanted to do black stories because I knew I could do them correctly, right? Because when I would watch them do them, I think that ain't us that's not what we do. I In Chicago and they asked Ann Curry and I to do some quote unquote minority stories, right and they said we want you to do a story about the black vote in Chicago. And so I said, okay cool. I'll do that and the woman young white girl said and so go to Cabrini-Green. So for people who don't know Cabrini-Green was one of the big projects and Chicago and I said, what do you want to know what Cabrini-Green voters are she goes? No, just black people. Well right there. I'm like No, I'm going to Cabrini-Green. I'll get you some black people in Chicago because you do know we all don't live in country, right they not know we don't know if in The Prado I don't know good times they did but that's the point. They don't really know right they see us in one light. The only light they know I'm sure that they had been doing stories and they always told them go to Cabrini-Green because it's a bunch of black people there. They had no idea that the city is full of black people Rich poor, you know big little I mean they're there and It was important for me. So for me, you know, I wanted to keep my little Detroit swag. I wanted I didn't want the blue blazer and a red tie and a white shirt, you know, so my clothes and just the way I carry myself it stay black enough, right? I wasn't my true self because none of us are what we can try usually be that on that third step ahead. I was black enough and that was important to me that was important to me. So some of the names you interview Nelson Mandela Katya OJ Simpson as you brought up and what people may be forget is that you were one of the first journalists. I don't know who might have been before you but I'll just say you were among the first journalist to have a sit-down with our Kelly and this is when he initially there were charged it was it was after the tape, correct? It was his first television interview after the tape has surfaced right know people had heard about it hadn't seen it. Then people saw it and Got him to sit down and there is another one of those things where you've got a beloved black figure who you know, if you ask certain questions may not come out in the best light and I always say, you know, and then you've got their handlers who want to tell you what you can and cannot ask and my whole career has been shaped around as most good journalists will do. No. I'm not going to agree not to Ask your client cannot answer the question, but I'm going to ask it but yeah, that was one of those that you know gained us a lot of attention and it was maybe that first real crack and you know, the R Kelly model what was funny to me was when that came out in people's like we going to boycott and he ain't right and then Chocolate Factory dropped well. About not you know not being afraid to ask these tough questions, especially on a sensitive subject matter as this one. Here's a clip from you asking our Kelly about illya in particular. Illya that was an issue that a lot of people came to both of you at the time 94 and wonder the rumor was that you had married her. We know she's gone. Now. We know that she can't defend herself but records have been brought up a marriage license and an annulment paper. No disrespect here Gordon, but Ali has gone and I have a lot of respect for Leah and I and our parents I would definitely not be even discussing and Leah, I will not do it because I would not ask has nothing to do with this and I just but Robert out of respect for her mom and her father understanding and again if you choose not to I understand. I don't want you to talk about Alia as much as I want to clear up the situation well, but by her not having anything to do with the situation, I would hope that people and my fans and everybody will understand why it is I definitely so is it fair to say though that the legal documents that have been shown are real. I really don't think it's fair to say anything dealing with aleeya because I just don't think that Alia, you know deserves that I don't I wouldn't want to bring up right now. Now it is you were doing that interview. Well one, how did you get it? Like what what made our Kelly because I will say this I getting back real quickly to weird timeout Gayle King and people are bringing up when she went after our Kelly, but she didn't go after Harvey Weinstein. I'm like first of all nobody told our Kelly's dumbass to do that interview. Nobody did alright you have to agree to do it. She has interviewed Harvey Weinstein's lawyer and one of his accusers that was already done, but our Kelly has made himself available. So it is you better believe if She could have sat down with Harvey Weinstein. She would have everybody they mama trying to get that interview. Like that is his lawyers just smart enough that he's not sitting down with anybody. So anyway, I again as I ask you how did you wind up getting this? So, you know, it was a time where everybody was going after our Kelly and I think that there are a couple of people in the industry that kind of make a name for themselves that if you want to talk to somebody here the 10 people you want to go to and at that time being He had a greater position than they have now because white folks didn't care about black people in the news back then see now. You know TMZ would have it or extra would have it or he'd go on, you know a white show back then they didn't care about our Kelly so it wasn't important. And so when the tape broke his people realize we got to talk to somebody and I'm sure he probably had talked to some disc jockeys and some other Things but I think they wanted somebody who they felt would give some credibility to the interview and some weight to it and to her credit my who still with me today my Booker Carol Johnson green never gave up on trying to get our Kelly I kept saying he ain't talking he forget him. He ain't talking and she just kept going and kept going and kept going and one day. She literally burst into my office. I thought somebody had died. Literally I was like, she was screaming and yelling. We got it. We got it. We got it and we got it. And so we flew out and set out with him and it was amazing to me because you know, the denial was there. He kept telling me he never he didn't look at the tape and I said well, why wouldn't you look at the tape and he said well if I know I didn't do it. Why would I look at the tape? I said dude, there's somebody look that much like me. I would absolutely want to see what they look like. And you know, when we were done again when that red light goes off. He kept saying to me you believe me and don't you believe me. Believe me, and I said dude, it's not for me to believe you or not believe you I said I will tell you this I might have said this on the air I said if that were my daughter I'd be looking for you. That's how much it looks like you because it is original original claim was that was his brother. He tried to get his brother to take the rap for him and you know, but we are culpable in. To all right now because black people had heard the whispers about our Kelly. The Alia thing was like we acted like that and so has just assume let's just assume that he really loved Dahlia, you know back in the day people were marrying 16 year olds, and I don't mean that day but back in the day right further back than that, but I will say this let's let's give him that anomaly. Let's just say that was the one and whatever special connection they had is weird as it might seem let's give him That one it's the rest of them that caused real problems that we knew. Okay. We can't just give him a Leah if we're hearing about this one this one this one in this one and so at some level though because of his genius. We were able to look away. It's the same thing. God Rest his soul with Michael Jackson, right another person that I did a story on we were never able to sit down with him per se but Johnny, Karin was a mentor of mine and he wanted me to do a story when he was representing Michael from their perspective of what a day at Neverland was right. So I flew out to the ranch and walked around with Michael and the kids and but again let that Michael Jackson be the postman Michael Jackson. Not the Superstar we to run that dude out on a rail you having sleepovers with Seven and twelve and thirteen-year-olds now that ain't happening in my neighborhood. But Michael Jackson, it's a whole nother thing. So Society has some culpability in all of this too. Well, I mean considering like as much as people have tried to make our Kelly into the victim to your point. Do you realize that day in a black man out there that could be victimizing women for 30 years 30 years and nobody say a word and get away with it or everybody's Just something to happen like that. He got away with that long time. Same thing with Bill Cosby. This is a long time. So that's what happened when you not just not just have talent but you have the money to defend what you do and you provide something. It's a lot of people out there still they not giving up Step In The Name of Love. It just happened. That's all you you know, and I still listen I will play his music in my house. I won't buy it anymore, right? I will not go. Go to another concert, right but I'm not if you said to me because I had this argument friend of mine. You can't listen to our Kelly Nomo. So I said, okay. Well, let's go turn off every freak out there that you can tell you my record. Watch a TV show watch a movie. See how many people you come up. Well, we wouldn't be watching or listening a lot because now it's like so ingrained that he is a monster like I can't even do it bad and especially his earlier stuff which feel like a blueprint Him wrapping up with him singing rather smell here sometimes like oh there's some truth to you know, I really can't so it's all right. I know it in the crib take you give him no money no more no more, right? That's the more important part. Look at I got a lot more. I want to discuss with you particularly. Again this you the your career Ledger of the people that you've interviewed is really spectacular. So I definitely wanted to get into you. Talking about your interview with Tupac which also became something that was very held your thoughts also on this upcoming election because I know you have some thoughts on that and I have some fun questions for you. We gonna test your Detroit - so more with air Gordon when we return It when you look over the scope of your career, why do you think so many of so many important newsmakers celebrities? Why do you think they trusted you? I think trust is the key word there, right? I tried to be fair and I continue to try to do that. Even if I don't like you don't like your stance, so I try to present it in a way that you It to me if it's a taped interview, you know, I don't try to slant it once you get back to editing and I try to be fair but the journalism I grew up with and was taught is different than the journalism of today. Somebody asked me today at another interview, you know, do you ever think we'll get back to trustee journalism? I don't know. It's it's different if you were a host of a show or your talking head and a lot of host now are Talking Heads. They're not necessarily. They haven't been trained that way this whole sense of showing both sides and double sourcing and all the things that we grew up with. It really has gone by the wayside. So I don't know but I would like to believe that people trusted that I was going to be fair. Even if I disagree with them and it has not been until the Trump Administration that I ever came out. Even when I did not like a president in office and publicly said anything, you know again that old-school. Me I deliver the story I but I never say you know, this is horrible. And this I have absolutely said that now we have an inept incompetent man in the White House and again America has culpability in that. I don't blame him for being there. That's our fault, but The kind of lockstep March that I've seen some people fall into his frightening and you really start to think about you know, this is how things like slavery and the Holocaust can happen, you know, people say that could never happen again. Oh, yeah, look at the lockstep that Republicans the great majority of them have gotten into and the fact that because Mitt Romney said the other week, I've got to follow my faith and my God, and that's great, but it shouldn't have been the shock that it became because the rest of these fools have simply said, oh my God, I'm too afraid to go against Trump. Are they afraid or is it because his he keeps them in power? You know, I think they've just made the train both because both sphere right in the sense of even if it's just keeping them in power and listen, it's not Political power this is and we again conversations we've had behind closed doors Black Folk understood that eventually there will come a time where white people would become very threatened by means of the way. They've lived their entire lives the opportunities. They've been given and this is you know, I try to tell white folks when we have these conversations. This isn't beat me all up. It's just the truth, right? And so when you see your way of life being threatened and it's starting to slip Go away, you know you get your back up and you start in that Foxhole with the people that look like you and you start fighting to keep that Foxhole safe. One of the things that I think about is, you know, the wealth Gap we talked about this in the book take a look at how many people found Robert Smith when he wiped away the debt last year for more house. five billion dollars richest black man in America But Jeff Bezos is worth a hundred and twenty three billion after a divorce. So you compare 5 billion to a hundred twenty-three billion and now you start to understand even at that level the wealth Gap is so wide it is almost impossible to catch up which is why we always have this sense of you know, how white people say Let It Go slavery was not now dude. I ain't Lettin it go cause y'all haven't let it go. It ain't Fair yet. Yeah, I mean and they keep benefiting from it. So to your point. So the Federal Reserve survey of Consumer Finance says that a typical black family has only 10 cents for every dollar held by a typical white family, which is when you think about how insane that stat is the wealth Gap now looks worse today than it did, you know when our parents and Grandparents were alive and it's like how is that possible when we've had basic progress, you know civil rights like we've had Basic progress that's been established and yet this wealth Gap. So that's when we have to start to be critical of politicians. I watched the other night when they were on stage the Democratic nominees talking about what has to happen for black people. When's it gonna happen? Y'all been saying the same stuff for the for as long as I can remember right and black leadership? What are we doing the closes wealth Gap? What are we doing to close the education Gap? What are we doing to have a better floor for Black Folk to stand on economically sure. There's some people who have made great strides and have great positions and great. But the lot of us still struggle are still in poverty. There's still a position of being unable to really get sure footing and take advantage of opportunities. And so I just think At some point we need new narratives and that's Again part of why I wanted to do the book. I think that the narratives that took us to this point. We're great and there was an entire generation that were you know, I mean the greatest of the great that 60s generation Freedom Fighters and all those folk those were fantastic people who literally put their lives on the line, but where do we go from here? And that's the big question that I keep saying to To all of us. Do you know because you got a couple of Sony's and Alexis in the driveway does not mean you made it. No, but I do think one thing maybe we need to get over and what had me thinking about. This is not only the conversation you and I had when you were doing the research and writing for this book, but also I was reading Coretta Scott King James biography, which is Amazing by the way, and I felt ashamed I did not know she even wrote one she wrote doing with and with another person. And when she would talk about some of the infighting that was going on. It was actually a relief because I think we had because we do think so highly of that generation with her and dr. Martin Luther King Malcolm X even before then we think so highly of him that we have thought that they never had any problems with each other that there was never any infighting that there was never which is the perennial sort of black tension of what should we do this outside looking in or should we do this from the the inside out like we're constantly arguing about this, right and it was actually a relief to figure out that you know, what even then even though they all agreed what needed to be achieved. They weren't all on the same page and that was okay not at all and it was human nature. I mean that that will always happen but what they did and there was generational in fighting there was just ego in fighting there. But what that generation did not allow is for any of that to become bigger than the prize, correct? And so they found ways Around it, you know, they're historians will continue to argue whether a Phillip Randolph was really the true father of the civil rights movement and a greater force than King, you know some historians believe King was just a better media magnate and that he presented himself better and was a better order and then you can have those arguments but over and above that. The divisions between Roy Wilkins thought Stokely Carmichael's thought Martin Luther King. Junior's thought were wide, but they all had a sense that we cannot allow this to get us so far off track that we lose sight of it and I think today because there is no One Singular segregation other than I would I would argue the issue with policing a black people now, that's kind of the One Singular issue that touches Is all of us back then segregation touched everybody. I don't care if you were rich or poor as a black person it touched everybody and as we began to break those barriers there were divisions that didn't touch everybody but policing touches everyone and so I am still hoping that black leadership and black folk will find a singular issue. Let's make it that and say Here's the one thing that we're all going to jump on board on and find ways to make real change and that's where I think leadership has. Fallen, you know we keep doing these same town hall meetings. How many Galas are we going to have? How many Town Halls are we going to have how many times are we going to salute this corporate person of that course, that's all great. It gets you a chance middle-class Black Folk to wear your Tuxedos and all of that but we ain't changing nothing. And so I think we gotta be about moving forward and a better way. What do you what are your thoughts on? I feel like I hear this more frequently and it's kind of disappointing because of what's at stake. Why are so many of us still not engaged in the political process? Because I think we believe and and you can make this argument that it hasn't done Us justice enough, but I remind people it was legislatively that made the real difference at the end of the day. It wasn't the marching by itself. And so if you believe IE Stacey Abrams that there's voter suppression and That there are Shenanigans going on to keep you out of office. Some people will walk away and say well what good is it to do what they tell me to do because they change the rules in the middle of the game that's always been the case here. And so the only way you can win a game is to play it. I don't know of any team or athlete that want a game sitting on the sidelines. And so whether the rules are fair, Not that's one issue. But what I do know is you got to be on the field to win and so we have to continue 2020 is going to show our metal, you know, black people talking about all this stuff is lot of yapping around we about to see what we're made of because someone came to me the other day. So what are we gonna do is if Trump gets back in how we going to get up there? And I said well then dude, it's too late. You got your chance right now. There's nothing to say he has to get back in now have Democrats giving given you enough to give your vote? No, they have not. Is it giving your vote away to some degree? But what we do is we think election day is the end of the race. It's not that's the beginning of the race and so once you put somebody in office, that's when your demand start and black folk have never really demanded ink Shooting of President Obama elected officials pay us back for what we've given to them and that's what we have to start doing. The kind of power Democrats have already conceded can't win it without the black vote. Okay now is the time how do you leverage that? Yep, how do you leverage that? And that's why sometimes I go to Black leadership and say it's not enough for you just to have meetings at the White House. Will you doing what else are you doing State dinner? That's cool for you, but come on man my fear though. Is that because there is a sense of you know, almost depression and I think there's a there was a different level of trust that was broken with Donald Trump being in office and looking at how the polls are turning now. It just it seems to me that there's a lot of black people who feel those who are engaged who feel like we can't take any chances. We have to vote for somebody that white people are going to vote for because when we all went into the poles and 16 We didn't know these white people are gonna vote for Donald Trump and they let us down right and so I get that hysteria, but that's also how you know as the old adage goes keep doing what you're doing on keep getting what you getting right? And so they're looking at how this thing is shaping up. I'm just like man now is the time to make a bold decision not to do the opposite because that's right. That's the only way you can break this up. There's no question about it. And and the fact that Hillary Clinton ran a piss poor campaign in 2016. It is not enough to just say well she ran a poor campaign and look what we got. Yeah, you know she ran a poor campaign took Black Folk for granted thought, you know appearing with LeBron and a couple of selfies would Beyoncé and Jay was enough that wasn't enough and you didn't turn folk out but what I also tell people is when you decided not to go it wasn't just getting Trump for years. It was getting close now to 200 federal judge appointments that will affect not only you how was the long not just your children? But potentially your grandchildren now and Trump said the other day and we got a lot of them in the pipeline so that in and of itself should be enough to get your ass up get registered and then go vote that day. I'm amazed at the people who register but then on Election Day it over they get tired. They show his own they gotta get their hair did all them things. Come on, man. Well, I'm amazed that we still in despite all this wonderful technology. You have not figured out a way to make voting more excited don't want to do that. Oh, I know because they don't want all of us voting they don't and as I've said to many young people if your vote wasn't worth anything. Why are they keep trying to take it from this? Right? So looking at you know, your the your long career and everything you've done? Why did you decide to become a journalist? Like why and when I should say, you know, I used to when I grew up I thought oh I wanted to be a lawyer right because you know you watch Parenthood. Cousin tied above. Yeah, you watch Perry Mason and you know, you see the dramatic thing in the courtroom and I always thought that was cool. Right and and I love clothes he wore a suit and all of that but I also in junior high school used to pretend like I was doing the news right just to Anchor and so one of my professors in college said, I think you'd be good at this. You should give it a try and really thought about it and I graduated and my Buddy and who later became police chief at Highland Park he and I used to our job was because when I graduated I didn't have a job was to go out in front of his mama's house and throw the softball for about six hours. It's so one day I said dude, if we don't stop this is going to be it for us and so my brother's old girlfriend worked at the PBS affiliate in Detroit, and she wasn't talking to him any longer, but we were still cool and she got me in as an intern. And I worked as an unpaid intern there for close to a year and I was serious about it and I got higher and you know, that was the start of it and I just it was just something that people said they thought I would be good at it wasn't a burning desire from the time. I was little and even when I was pretending I never thought that was going to be my career, you know, I went from being Bruce Lee to Julius Erving to you know, I mean I traditional kind of male thoughts. Who I was going to be right but yeah, the dope is good karate expert in the world or you know, but it all fell into place and I started as an intern I started hosting a show when the host didn't show up one night and I had to do it and then a friend of mine because I would have never done this a friend of mine who was a hustler in Detroit and by that. I mean she was Is a hustler in that she was a female camera person out in the field which never happened back then and she contacted bet and said hey we want to do your stories for bet news. So we became the freelance Bureau for BT news and I was a reporter and I'm telling you it all just kind of rolled together and a lot of it had very very little to do with me. I was just in the middle of the street getting hit boom boom boom, and I just kept getting up so So will you represent at least for a lot of us that I didn't watch BT from the beginning beginning but close to the beginning and you represent a part of that kind of old school BT Legacy, you know what those videos soul and Caribbean rhythms and Summit Teen Summit and of course then BT news and there has been I've heard BT get criticized a lot because they eliminate their news Department. I know it's obviously under different ownership now with Viacom But when you when you see in present-day how they've sort of decided to make their approach to news and serious issues. What are your thoughts about how different things? Yeah. I think that Beatty had a rough go and I'm not a BT apologist by any means, I think it had a rough go in the early days because it had to be everything to everybody. Right and Bob Johnson used to tell people look you want more news watch it more right and and Bob was strictly now. Amber's right. We show rump shaking videos because y'all watch him we show this and to a great degree. He kept the news Department afloat for many years and then we started to make money. And so today I think it is part and parcel whether it's bttv one or any of the the new kind of Slants to Black programming a lot of it is what what we Each in sheer numbers, but I also tell people why folk don't watch news in huge numbers. They know the importance of it networks know the importance of it and there's a reason that those news division. Yeah, they make money, but they could make more money with an entertainment entertainment program in that our slot but there's a reason because there's gravity to news there is power to news and that's why they keep them. And so whether it's black newspapers, Black radio black TV shows, you know you talk about in the book The the one in need to make sure that we keep these things afloat what you're doing independently what Roland Martin is trying to do independently, all of these things are important. I've got some things that we are hoping to announce very soon, but it's a struggle. I mean, let's be real about it. It's a struggle black people will tell you. Yeah. Yeah. We miss you. We want to okay, dude, but they did you watch did you watch it? All right, right. And you know, but I also know there were times where I did shows and people gave me a number which I thought was unrealistic ratings wise. We surpassed that number they still cancel the show. So at some level those networks didn't want it and was it just be T. So, I mean, we've got to we've got to get to what we say we want and what we really want and be about understanding though that the dissemination of information. It's still important very much. So a lot of people I always tend to think that BT gets a truly unfair amount of criticism. I think people are still in the mode of saying that they got to be all this to everybody even though there's Now options you have Revolt you have TV one you have other other places that people can go because I was having a conversation with somebody who work there and they were telling me that BT passed up on on Love and Hip Hop, right which is Huge franchise and like it or not not gonna lie. I watch it. There it is. I love the I love the Atlanta New York with those are my favorite I watch it. But I do also watch the news and you gotta balance it out, right? So that was how my ratchet with my reading. I will read it Gore's book and also watch loving us fair, but there but there are a whole generation of people that don't believe that do not do that believe this stuff to be real and and emulated. Yeah, right. And so if I'm getting paid to put pull somebody's we've that's one thing if I'm out at Chipotle because you said something wrong to me and I'm pulling your weed. That's a whole nother thing. And so I don't I don't legislate anybody's entertainment right? Because I watch I watch reality show but I've watched crazy stuff over the years, but I also understand that what you were talking about that balance is important and if we don't start to kind of show people that the need of a balances there, we're kind of out of Q which is what we continue to be because people are too afraid to say sometimes that's a little too much or you know, we want to cancel culture but we don't want to regulate it. Like we used to back in the day, right and especially this year with having accurate correct information in context in a election year is really important. And so I'm wondering, you know, there's a there's a dearth of black journalists out there. You know. I looked at some statistics. Six recently about the number of us that have left the field altogether and it's a staggering number and I'm not sure people in our own Community. I realize it's fashionable to hate the media I get it right but at the same time, it feels like a lot of us do not understand how that has drastically changed how we recovered how the issues that are important in our community and people think everything's all right, because I see Don Lemon every night. Well, they see Joy read on the weekend or the and and that's great that those faces are there, but the real power Is not in those seats and that's only an hour a night or an hour on a weekend or two hours enjoys case Saturday and Sunday. And so we have to understand that. The reason that black newspaper died is because we didn't support them. The reason that black radio coughed its way into non-existence for the most part. It's because we allow those stations to be bought up by white conglomerates, and we just Continue to listen not worrying about it because we heard enough of our music and then the music became formulaic. You can only hear five songs and artists like Prince had had he been conceived today would have never become prints because they wouldn't play it that music would have not not gotten play in Detroit. There was an independent DJ who really launched princes career the electrifying Mojo. I remember him and and he's the reason Prince became so big because But he wanted they were like, who is this dude? You know this freak is what they were looking at principles crazy to most people back then the music. What was it Rock was it on be was it but you had an independent DJ who could do that and we would have lost a genius had it been today's format where you only get to play 10 songs before I get to this fun little game I have for you. I want to ask you, you know, did you ever feel as if you were getting the the credit that you deserve because as I said when people if you go down your career resume, everybody would take that right now number one, but yet whenever there were conversations about who the best journalists your name will come up here and there but you know, of course before all the shit went down with him, but they say Matt Lauer or this person or that person and to me your name did not come up enough. So did you feel as if to some degree you were not giving your flowers? Yeah, but you know what I also It's the time you come up. So if you say to me have I ever had a thought of watching somebody on the network and going I'm better than that person. Hell, yeah, right but like I didn't control that and if I had gotten lost it it's like an athlete who gets lost in that sense of why and I'm making the All-Star Game better than some well maybe but the fans like this person better or you know, the ownership likes that person better and at that point when I was in the game and That way I don't think that networks were ready to really Place Black Folk in the way, you know, they had one so Gumbel was at NBC what we don't need another listen. I got wind of a closed-door meeting that NBC had once and they were looking at the new talent and they brought my name up and they said he's good, but I think he'll be another Gumbel and by that they meant that Bryant even though some people use think Bryant was a sellout and he's Uncle Tom Bryant was very Listen, I've got to say that they don't was nothing he was he is heavier that it was on point. He just never you know Ward on his sleeve and by that they meant we'd have another black dude who was going to say what he believed because nothing about you to is a like anybody that watches both of you. There's nothing about YouTube that are alike but they knew that he's going to be one who's going to tell us no, I'm not doing that or no we need to do that. And so I think that was a time I came up so I've had those thoughts in In my lifetime. I've also had a great career, right? So in one sense could have been bigger by Network standards and all. Yeah, should it have been maybe but if I look at my career and the people I've talked to in the places. I've gone I can't have any real regrets. Yeah. I mean look you your fave out. There ain't they don't have Mandela to Paco J&R Kelly or any other thing is I'm very thankful that I'm 30 years in and I'm Still doing stuff. I mean they're very few people who started when I started who are still in this game or still somewhat relevant or still so I'm good. Alright, and now it's time to play a game. It's called this of that. All right, get two choices not for you. Just get to pick one or the other and not this and that know this or that or very important. Okay Thriller Off the Wall. Thriller that was a reluctant it was it since they're both great. They're both great. The real answer is off the wall, but that's okay greens are mac and cheese greens. I just don't like cheese like I used to Greens. Is that a lactose type of the no no. No, that's not the issue. Okay. I mean on any given day by day nor the field. The field have you ever I still don't totally believe it even though I've seen these poles but it cuz it looks like his the his campaign has completely imploded Josephus. Is that Uncle that means well, but just can't do it no more. You know how you have that fun uncle and then he got too old to be really fun, but he still wanted to that's Joe Biden. All right. I still there's a part of me that wonders are we is this going to really turn out the way that we think in terms of like, you know, he As such the leader for a long time that it's just kind of hard for me to believe that the total bottom dropped out. But there we are. Call me younger Dennis Archer call me. Yeah, those are the both of the mayor's from Detroit for those who don't know. I figured you say call me. I almost wonder if that's a generational thing to some degree not if you look at it realistically now that was he was that love Dennis Archer. No one well and but Coleman Young was the man he brought us into a different day. That's for sure Four. Tops are The Temptations. Wow, I would I would probably have to say the Temptations only because the Four Tops by time. I was old enough to really appreciate music. They were on the latter parts of their hits, but I'll go with the temps and finally and I think this might be the toughest. I did Marvin Gaye Stevie Wonder. Wow. Always Save The Best For Last yeah. Yeah, I would probably go with Stevie gay. Yeah. Yeah, that is number. I got some hits don't eat that is not an answer. If you ask people tough questions under then Batman wonder and answer I'm going on acceptable Stevie Wonder Maybe today. Well you could Always say longevity body of work and forcing Marvin Gaye's like cut short, right, but then my favorite album of all time is what's going on. So, you know, you like that better the songs in the key of Life. Uh, I do only only because I think that just the dynamic of what Marvin was talking about was just so song Zakia like interventions is just as cold as that's why I said Marvin Gaye Stevie Wonder and mixed to and yeah you came up. But today I'm I know Stevie J Stevie Stevie Stevie Wonder one day. I'm not letting you get away with that and thank you so much for joining me. I appreciate it. Thank you for being a part of the book. I was going to say I really appreciate the fact that you included me. I cannot encourage people enough to please pick up conversations. And yeah, just just pick it up on shows. I'm not on. Yeah, baby. I'll encourage it every every time I'm out. I'll be unofficial mouthpiece for you because Not only do you get the diversity of opinion of the people in there, but I think it's it's just a very easy good digestible read. So certainly if you're concerned about these issues as we are perfect book to pick up and make a friend pick one up too. So we had told y'all I ain't out here supporting the news like y'all need to and I agree. So pick up his book. Anyway, it's getting out of here our final segments coming up. I say I heard man one day. I'm gonna stop talking about myself like I'm two people The final segment is coming up. Fuck it. I'm bothered. So as of the taping of this podcast its primary season, which is why now more than ever. I think we need to get a few things straight now the winners and losers don't really matter to me. That's a separate discussion. What's bothering me right now is that the Democrats just can't get out of their own way, and I'm not talking about the candidates because And those decisions will be made but the Democratic supporters who are spending so much time focused on the wrong shit. I have seen so many people tweeting about how they don't feel inspired or how if their particular candidate doesn't win. They're just gonna say fuck it and not vote or this silly ass hand-wringing about decorum and blah blah blah blah blah. Do you need a candidate to inspire you? What are you five inspiration is certainly ideal. Deal but inspiration isn't a necessary quality for a candidate. Are they competent? Can they get shit done? Do they know that the Kansas City Chiefs playing Missouri and not in Kansas. Well, your political candidate isn't your eHarmony or Christian Mingle match? Can they do the job or not? Also, all of you people who are threatening not to vote if your candidate isn't picked y'all don't even deserve to vote with an opinion like that. Stay home and you'll get exactly what you deserve and trust me you won't like it because you don't like it now. And finally, I don't care about Nancy Pelosi's paper tearing. I don't care that Elizabeth Warren probably has a Bernie Sanders voodoo doll at home that she sticks needles in at night. I don't care about who gets along and who doesn't if winning the election is the utmost importance all of this in the grand scheme doesn't even fucking matter.

Jesse case played Vagner and we got to throw.Ourselves into Germany and German classical music and I think that was probably the birth of where today's character came from.

I love it there and whenever I get the chance to meet somebody who has never been to the state. I try my best to tell them how wonderful it is, but when we got Tim the Tool Man Taylor to tell you about Pure Michigan, I would just relent and show them that Thankfully the toolman never had to smooth over any science murders from the state like this week's guest.

I think that would be awesome. Oh, we will watch anything literally anything. Yeah. We there's a huge community of horror film makers in the midwest here and people, you know Reach Out wanting to be on the show to push them and while we don't do that. We are happy some dust links and we will absolutely watch anything. And as far as the neighbors Film Society stuff, you know, Adam and I we always talked about what we used to do after movies for me. It was late night. Go to a Denny's or a Silverman's and Michigan and kind of debrief with our friends and mine was a Ram's Horn. Yeah and would just go talk about those films and we you know, we're just getting off the ground with this thing now, but we would love to have those same conversations. So some of the movies that I've seen lately in the theater that I'd love to talk about or things on Netflix Annihilation. I just watched the ritual which we learned about from a show we listen to which I thought Great. Yeah, the ritual was fantastic and then I'm watching so many new things on shutter. Just watched cold hell which if you haven't seen it it is there is so much going on in this amazing. German film can't recommend it enough. It's on shutter. If you're not already a subscriber to shutter you can use promo code neighbors to get a full month free while you're trying it out see if it's for you. I can't recommend it enough check. About Tara fire to that movie is pretty rad. Yeah. I haven't done that yet. I have you know what? I watched recently that I hadn't seen in a long time with Session 9. I bought that on DVD a long time ago. I love that movie. Have you seen that? I have not it's great David Caruso's in a classic also, give it a shout-out to the true heroes of our story the old ladies who served coffee at Denny's and Rams horns. And was that placement McGillicuddy's was that place Silverman's Silverman's? Yeah McGillicutty, you know, we drink coffee for four hours. Probably yeah Tippett dollar. Yeah. Yeah talking about movies. We would never make the ways we make movies better that we like. Yeah, and here we are with a podcast which asshole anyway, so check us out on social media. All right. So while we've been be essing you can hear our theme song underneath us right now. This is an extended full rendition of run for it. The my neighbors are Dead theme song by our composer Jesse case, which you'll be hearing a lot of Of this episode if you've ever wondered about where the idea for our theme song came from I talked to Jesse and he gave us a lot of great Insight on what was going on in his head at the time stick around after the show to here where you can get your own copy, and now here's a little bit from my conversation with Jesse case. I'll tell you man. The timing of the timing of you asking me to do this track was like perfect because I had just downloaded for free. I think a plug-in on the Native Instruments platform called kinetic treats, which is by a dude named Jeremiah Savage who does he does a bunch of stuff with them? I think and you know his whole MO is at least for the work he does for them is all about finding non-musical sounds and turning them into kind of easily use A musical patches and kinetic treats in particular has all this stuff that's just like tailor-made for the horror genre, you know, there's just like this creepy affected electric train. And then the thing I ended up using was the toy piano, which I sort of combined with some other stuff to make the at least, you know, kind of the build the core sample normally when I make short form music like podcasts themes or transitional music and sound design or any type of introductory music for a thing. You know, I'll make the make the core track first, which is You know anywhere from 10 seconds to maybe a minute at the longest and then sometimes often like well after the fact I'll go back and look at it and be like, okay, this could potentially turn into this could potentially be expanded into something that's like, you know, quote unquote single length, I guess normally when I do that, I have a pretty good idea of what that end 3 to 4 minute track is going to sound like, you know, because all the main elements seem to be there like the drop or the hook or whatever. I want to call it in the main. The T run for it actually surprised me though because as I was making it I started to realize there's actually like two or three separate parts to this like the drop isn't where I thought it was and there's this part is way longer than I realized it was and it ended up surprising me and I liked it and I hope you do too. Well. We love it. And we hope you do too stick around after the episode and you can hear how to get your own copy of run for it. The my neighbors are Dead theme without further. Do let's get on to this weeks episode inspired by the events of the human centipede. Well, thanks for doing this. Oh, you're very welcome. Thank you for taking me in and keeping me of course, of course. Yeah, you're very welcome. Very adamant about getting in here to talk to us. Oh, yes. Well, you know she was sort of in like for his word like terror terror status emergency it right. You know it. A very sort of bad situations that we are trying to recollect fires as quick quickly as possible. Yeah, not good. Well, so you did you find the place? Okay. Well, of course, I'm from Germany. Okay, great. Well, I'm sitting here talking to Alphonse gobble - yes, you are. Thank you. Okay. Well, thanks guys grow people from from Germany. Correct? Yes from specifically in Germany from Southeastern Bavaria. Yeah. Yes, which is of course itself in the Southeastern portion of germ very beautiful country. Lovely? Yes, thank you. Very beautiful. Yes. Yes and up until recently of course was a something of a tourist destination. Well before we jump into that Alphonse talk to me a little bit about where you're from Waters. What are some of the things that was known for or what are some fun things to do with from from where you from? Oh Vera to begin Adam. I've yeah. Well so lunch should is the county seat of Bavaria and it is a lovely town. I myself am not from there. I'm sort of a jack of all trades. I am a musician. Yeah first but you know that is not a good career. So I am you don't think so. I know so well, I like some too because I am them. Yeah, yes, but you know as far as things like Financial Security share, right so a so what I own several businesses around the area I own a lovely coffee shop and on. During which is where I'm from. I own a bookstore in Dean golfing own another bookstore and gone coffin badabada. Yes. I'm sort of all around because the bar is the Bavaria is it is a lot of different sort of types of people are brought together here like in that you're very successful entrepreneur I do. Okay, you know, I mean again like coffee shop is not like, you know, you are not you're not rich. I think it's it. I think it's impressive though that a Project could you know you could bear the fruits of success with a passion project sure, if I'll and again lots of my business came from tourists, right which you know, I have of late because of the incident but you know have all but disappeared quite rightly. So before the incident your you were kind of thriving right? Yeah. Yes out of the tourism in your narrative, but Southeastern buffer areas such a beautiful area. You've got the East signs in rivers. You've got to see you've got sick all the Gothic architecture Spa Casanova. You know, I played once is that right? Yes. How was that? I was great eye open for Three Dog Night you open for three dogs are fantastic. I love three dog night. They're great. One of my favorite bands one of my favorite American groups. Yeah. We got a couple of them over here as well. I would love to keep talking to you about the success that you had before the incident, but I guess that's kind of kind of why we're here because of the incident. Yes. Well, yes it is. All you hear Wells incident of course was the the centipede the human Center for Human Centipede. Yes, and of course our dear. Dr. Joseph cheerful who is yeah. Do you know did you know him before any of this? Cause he's a pretty pretty successful guy. I mean, yeah separating. Yeah siamese twins not easy. Dr. Cheerful was a very very you have to understand in in Germany. Surgeons are like rock stars. Sure because we have an obsession with like with like cutting people open. Is that all that you know, what? Well yes likes, but okay, but now when that means that probably didn't translate like we have an obsession with like looking at the insides of people know, okay, we have a we have an obsession with Medicine like the medicine. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah medicine is a great profession. It's a great thing to look into. Okay. I'm sorry. I'm a little nervous because my English is not very good. No, your English is great Alfonso. He like I mean, I understand that by American Standards is great Germans timing. No. No, this is not cut it but I would I be able would my English fly in Germany or is my English. Terrible Germany TBA, okay. God okay. So dr. J. Dr. Joseph Schneider cheer for height has translates to this cheerful. Oh, okay. I don't know that I know fun thing. Dr. Cheerful cheerful. Dr. Heiter. Yeah, so he's kind of like a rock star where you're from Boswell, you know, he was he was reclusive sure, you know, but up until the human centipede incident where he sold three people together Master but Master, but yeah with 100% medically accurate suit It was the incident he was sort of the was a different type of reclusive. It was like, I don't know. Who is there. Who is there a rock star who's known for being a recluse like like yours The Edge or your your your Cat Stevens? Yeah. Yeah. I'm curious to so when you find out that he's sold three people together as to mouth after Mouse out in his downstairs laboratory in his house. What are you most taken aback by the the fact that he did it or the fact that it's 100% medically medically accurate. A bit of Botox to be honest. Yeah, I have to say I mean like beings that we are so interested in the inner workings of the body. Yeah as a German culture right medicine. Yeah, you know, it is sort of like was not it's like one half of me is disgusted and the other half is like yeah, I could see that I feel the same way. I think actively it's interesting. Nope. That's not no. No, it's not object. No, it's um, no, I think you're right. Objectively it is no no, no wheat no, and for all of those listening at home, we do not in Bavaria finds this interesting. We find it horrible and we find it at oh, it's a it's a it's an outlier. Okay, you know and see here's the thing about like, it's just the ways that rumors spread the you know, suddenly we are so varied it. There's so many other places in Germany that are only known for one thing, right? You know what I mean, of course like you got to do During Berg, you've got Berlin. You've got Dresden. You got Munich - ha yeah. To a certain extent Germany in general not. Oh, no you like White's great pastries in Nuremberg. Yeah, but if you if I say to you Nuremberg, what do you think of nothing? Great, right? Yeah. Exactly. Nothing great. Great food. Just sitting sounds of Windows going to faced. Yeah. It's a it's a real. It's a blemish on your On The Run directly and next thing they'll on shoot. Yeah, and the entirety of Bavaria are at risk right now of being known for one thing. Which is one single doctor in his house sewing people Mouse to but Mouse to budmouth two buttons and injecting them with some vitamin so they didn't die. That's I the fact again I the fact that it's a hundred percent medically accurate is it's incredible to me, but I understand where you're coming from it and it's not great. So not a good situation, you know and just rumors spread and suddenly like, you know, like what is What is the what is the children's it's a there's a word for it a children's game. It is a children's game where even children are at recess sitting quietly on the bench thinking about the lesson of the day. They sometimes play this game which is where one person passes something to somebody else a telephone. Thank you. Yes. Yes, and then that as a person passes it to somebody else but at that point it is completely different. Yeah and on and on, you know, thud like through three people maybe more Maybe up to 10. I feel like this is something like when you do something dumb in high school and you're kind of known for that for the rest of high school or in college exactly. You're like no. I'm so many other things than just the one time. I did this stupid thing. It is so frustrating. We have a saying in German that translates roughly to it feels like screaming into a dark hole Yeah Yeah, I can see how that we talk to a guy not that long ago who was kind of helping a girl who crapped her pants at a party take revenge on people because that's all she was kind of known for it. She was pretty pissed about that through the internet great. Anyway, so talk to me now about how does tourism how is that affected by this? So I have things are kind of things are great. Right prosperous. People are coming to your to your shops to your coffee shop there here and you play your music which you brought a guitar. I mean, yeah, so I did yes. Well, that's his part is I so I have sort of been I have joined a task force put together by some board of Tourism of the Of lunch shoots the county seat of Southern Bavaria to try and sort of figure out what are we going to do? How do we get people to not associate Bavaria visit a doctor who sold a bunch of people together asked her mouth as the mouth you guys go into panic mode right away, or do you kind of think maybe if we just don't talk about it people won't talk about it or do you is this like damage control right away? We gotta tell people that it's not just about ask them out here. And yes exactly value. No sort first like first we were just sort of Trying to stay quiet about it sure, you know and we sort of gave people the benefit of the doubt but you know, it's like I say rumors spread and next thing, you know, we see a significant drop in to particularly young Collegiate Americans who make up the majority of our demographic Lindsay and Jenny to of Yas, they were not they did there wasn't favorable for them. Right exactly. So here so picture this okay picture this You are going this is sort of the typical tourist experience. Yeah, you going you're in Holland. You're having fun. You're partying. Yeah, you do you're having a mushroom. I like that. Yes, you dry. And you want to go to Italy sure. Yeah, but you don't want to go through Austria, right? We got that zeros. So you drive south you drive south you rent a car obvious thing. Don't fly Ryanair careful gross cheap, but gross right know you rent a car you drive through the beautiful landscape down through the rivers and the dark dark trees and our beautiful complicated Autobahn which is the most complicated system of highways in the world by far and you drive through a next thing, you know, you decide to stay at a motel you find a beautiful little more tell you are you are going out to restaurants. You meet a lovely Vater next thing, you know, you're driving through the forest. Boom. You're at a nightclub. You're partying you're at Bunker right bunker is our famous nightclub in the land should are it is actually closer to our Munich, but it's like right between okay. Yes. It's sort of lovely little area called muhsin touring which is a lovely little town with a beautiful night club scene go figure, but that is South East Germany always surprising you are most nightclubs in the woods neuro. Yeah. Well that's sort of like the thing, you know, they're like you have you know, it's sort of like it's annoys thing and it's also just like You know when you're clubbing in Germany, you know, like I'm John and I'm saying is like yeah what happens in geese reporting stays in Keystone hoardings that going anywhere, right? Exactly. So and there are a lot of clubs most of which I was realizing is that compiled a list have like a real sort of like warlike, uh-huh names which is sort of weird. So there's like bunker which is the main fun. But then there's like a crater is great. There's like a deep concrete the good one. There's just one called Extreme. Which is lots of fun. There's a let's see carpet bomb is great. Gravity's rainbow. That's like a more obscure one. Yeah reference fits do they do they drink specials these places? Oh, yeah absolutely likes are seeing my favorite drink says all steamy Colton. Oh, what's that translates as and then they came from me. Oh, okay gin-based. Very good. Huge in man. Yeah, but yeah, Germany man. Yes, I can't do the juniper berry baby. Play the piece OK. It's ok on the paleo diet to which will really Wrong. Oh, yeah, you have a paleo diet. Oh everyone in Germany. Is this five-year? So sin and beautiful and smart. There are so many Alphonse. I can't keep track. I heard it one called the Kinko diet or the ginkgo diet or something like that. There's a lot of that's a fun for you eats. The lizard's I think that's right. Yeah, I think that's right. Okay. Yeah, so, okay. So now there's a great club scene is beautiful. Yes. It's such a wonderful Drive-Ins and all you have to do is like to get to Italy afterwards is Drive South so like 50 miles at most throughout Syria, which is You know, that's about as much Austria's you can take its the ice tree has the shape we call it like the was it was a translation like the dirty foot? Yeah. Yeah. It's like the little part that sort of sticks under Germany and bothers everybody. Yeah. The dress is Argos was the mainland and send you on Italy your vacation is wonderful. You take away whatever you take away. So these are great. I mean this sounds awesome. The only thing that bothers me is the Joseph cheerful live in there. Yeah, exactly. But you know, I mean that guy Joseph cheerful is one of a kind Kind and to those of you listening at home. Please knows that all of the rest of the many surgeons who work on siamese twins in the area are perfectly normal. Are there a lot of Siamese twins? Where you from? Not anymore. Okay, great. Well, I'm excited because I'm I'm happy that you came here to talk to us about this to put the word out there that it's not just about ass to mouth where you're from you brought a guitar. Yeah. I'd like to you have some songs. I'd like to hear some some songs about how great it is where you're from. Yeah laughter the bucket people's hearing hundred percent web. So, you know a little bit like this is sort of like we have a say is house has many rooms. Yeah, most of which are hidden deep in the basement. Right and it is totally like so this is this is just a sort of say like there is more to Bavaria than meets the Casual glance of those who have only heard about the human centipede. Which again is there somebody sewed three people together as two mouse asked him as 100% match exactly more to Bavaria than meets the eye Alphonse help. Oh, I'd love to hear some of these songs represent. Yes. Well, and again, these will eventually be used for like tourism videos or perhaps radio spots that sort of thing just to get the word out. Yeah, yeah squash these rumors right here 100% Exactly. All right. I'm a it's must admit. I'm a little nervous. Oh, don't be nervous. This is great. I've only am I thought I sent these to my dog and said, oh, yeah, we have another saying in Germany, which is before you try something on people. Try it first on your dog. He did it in the dog's ready showed three dog's ass to mouth, right? Oh, I'm sorry. No, no that I should have I should have seen the parallels now. That's my bad. I'm sorry. Okay. So this is sort of like a I'm sorry. There is another saying oh nice another words that I don't know. It is a musical. It's a musical term there like you have like one one you have like three parts of a song. Okay, and you like push them all together? Like all front front to back even though they don't necessarily belong together, but then say what's it's like a musical term for it a medley. Yay. Yay. Yay. Okay. So this first song is just about like, you know, it's just if this is about like lunch shoot, okay, I'd like a little more experimenting with maybe a motto. Okay? Okay by lunch you yes a long the finding Autobahn. So startling and complex. Who knows what his next your map is useless. So many unmarked roads What secrets will you find in the forest at night? Come get lost in line should get lost. Totally lost. What will happen to you. No one knows fun surprises. Come get lost in line shoots completely and totally lost you may never get where you thought you were going to go. And then moving on to the second part of this is okay. That's another seconds is the second part system the middle part. I'll catch you know, it's quite frankly as the first part just that's just sort of my experience with it. Okay, give French people different languages different diets. What fun when different people come together as far as Bavaria Better Together? Right, there is no other love is an infection. You can't help but can't - then you and a total stranger are hopefully a match in Bavaria. You have no choice you'll soon become attached Sinai. So yeah, that's a lovely one and that's just sort of like the here's the third one. Let's see. This is the end part This is the End party exactly. Yeah for the way. Which is like probably the ones that were like die first, will you be calm Vaudeville Germany turn you into Vans you disappear and to the trees beauty that will permanently bring you to your knees. Traveling through Germany means permanent changes permanent changes becoming something totally new you and a friend and another friend traveling through Germany means permanent changes. He reversible when you come to Germany, then you come to Germany. You literally may never return I'll Well that feels nothing at all. Right. Thank you. Those are great. So, yeah, it's just the goal behind all of those songs is to make people not to associate Bavaria this doctor cheerful who sewed three people asked her mouth. Yeah as to mouth. Yeah.

In a podcast called ""My Neighbors Are Dead,"" composer Phim Jesse case explains the origin of the centipede, which he calls ""probably the birth of where today's character came from,"" per the Chicago Tribune. Jesse case, who plays Vagner on the popular Netflix series Stranger Things, says the idea for the centipede first came to him while he was working on a show for a Chicago comedy theater. ""We got to throw,"" he says.

Thanks for listening to our podcast today today. I've got Jack Bowen who is one of Australia's leading amateur boxers big career ahead for Jackie's been doing it since he was 13 14 years old and you're welcome Jack, you know, go good mate, very good. So we've been putting questions out to on Instagram and social media and has been quite a few people.I suppose sending questions in that they'd like to ask about you a bit about and get to know get to know you I suppose so join. It gives a bit of a rundown on the background of yourself what you do fight, so I don't know how you got into it that sort of stuff. Well, first of all, I started when I was about 12 or 13 and I came down the box and Shop under yourself and I was playing AFL at the time. I wanted to get for putting in the preseason and the best way for me personally to do that was to come down the block.And I just fell in love with the sport. I still kept on playing I felt throughout my teens just as a little bit of a distraction from boxing as you know, it can get a bit full-on sometimes and just to have a balance with mates playing a team sport as well was good. That's funny because a lot of people do exactly the same thing. I got in a box exactly the same way playing footy got injured when the local boxing gym and never went back to Footy forget. I just fell in love with it and just the people you meet through seeing as well. Mmm. Just genuine people and I fell in love with the atmosphere at the boxing shop. Yeah as well and I also gone back to my life at the moment. Yeah. I'm working part-time or working outside school hours Care at the moment. So that keeps me busy on the side and pretty much boxing full time as well. Yeah nice and you buy your a recently at University, but you're deferring at the moment. Is that right? Yeah. I had to defer just I think I'm going to Try and put all my eggs in one basket to make the world championships coming up. And yeah, that's pretty much my sole focus at the moment and I couldn't uni even know I was with I was part-time study. It's a massive time consumption for me personally like it was it was just a bit too much especially with the training load. We have been doing trips away trying to manage. That was a bit. Yeah. Just got a bit too much and stressing me out instead of just focusing on my boxing, which is what I need to do. Cool. So you we bought a victoriaboynton Queensland I was born in your book, but your parents are from Victoria every else Victoria foreigners cricket, and I have Alex obsessed. So that's probably what an awesome cricket and I felt that was my first love and then boxing kind of it later on and I seen you've got a you got a sisterly met who actually send us a question in who's your favorite sister? Yeah. It is a it is such as I live. Yattawan, if there was another one she been sick and spot maybe some of the mood she has he probably would be but she's more obsessed with I felt and I think yeah, she's she's a lunatic that's all she seems to talk about is 40 and then we'll 40 season's over. She doesn't get around the cricket. So she's just stuck waiting for the funniest. She's just stuck right for pre-season has been training who's your footy team Western Bulldogs footscray? Have I gone at the moment? Yeah, not too bad. I don't think it's just that feeling out process at the start of the year, but we're only on the right path. That's normally what team say when they're losing and they losing or winning. No lost a couple. Yeah, really? Yeah. I think we won the premiership two years ago. Oh, no three years ago. Yeah throw you have maybe three. Yeah. I miss that. I actually miss the Grand Final guy. I was in Ireland at the time. Yeah, we had two weeks in Ireland. Celtic cop. Yeah, it was 2016 and I stayed in Dublin a few extra days and then on my flight back I landed in Sydney and I have my Bulldogs scarf and beanie on and everyone in Sydney because we played Sydney come up to me and said that we'd won so so you're promoted a little bit for me because I wanted to go home and watch it. But I guess I asked for it. Well, unfortunately the world now you like there's no secrets and I nothing I got it on DVD I can watch it back whenever I want if you miss a fight now. On TV like you hit up your geeky social media everything. You can't check any special every time I want to notify. It was all don't even go to BoxRec anymore. Just go straight to yes Flora page. And yeah, that's right highlights pop up. All right, cool. So you love you boxing. We've got we've got a lot of questions here to get through a few different people have sent similar questions. So we'll just we can bounce a few of those off each other. I suppose one of the questions is how did how did you get into? Acting and why do you do it? What what is it about boxing that you love and I suppose you've already answered how you got into boxing through your football you come down for a bit of training and what is it that keeps you going Keith? We don't buy actually, I'm just obsessed with the sport. Like I actually love like constantly watching boxing and I love the competitiveness that it brings out of me when I'm at training and when sparring and and just constantly improving and getting better. I think. What if I ever get to the stage in boxing where I don't feel like I'm learning or I feel like I'm just staying in the same place. I think I'll just give it away doing because at the moment, I just feel like I'm obsessed with just constantly learning and improving and and I think as a I think it's a sorry. I think it's a sport where you can never stop learning. Yeah, but that I think yeah, that's the thing is if I feel like I'm not like yeah. Yeah, I don't know right? Yeah. That's right. I think it's more on myself. If I don't want to learn. Yeah. Yeah for sure. I suppose on that giving up then on the other hand. This is not a question by somebody this is just what I'm throwing out there. So, you know, you get some people they just stay too long in the sport. You want to know when your time's up to and I right that's what even the best thing is. I trust you so much with my career and Chiara and yeah people here that if it ever came to that stage, I know you tell me yeah that looks that's tall enough. Yeah. Yeah, but I bet if he's on let's hope these are four ways. Like I just I just love the sport. I love competing. I love that competitive nature and constantly also like proving people wrong as well. I like I like having a dig and I was insane when I'm when I was a young kid. Yeah, if I'm 40 or someone had picked me for a team that I'd show you the next week. Why? Hey that's good. Why I didn't want to why you should have picked me or yeah, and I think that's the that's the reason why the state amateur before the Olympics and World Championships at you as only prove people wrong, and I want to I'm going to get the I want to show people. Yeah that I could do this. Yeah, that's excellent. And it's not a lot. So going off that off this little roll into another question that we've got. So somebody's asked how do you manage your mental preparation before a fight? So what are your thoughts and this person also wants to know what are your thoughts immediately is UN to ring in these stepping up the stairs what's running through your head? And it does that does that continue throughout the fight or you thinking different things during the fight? I think the so the first part was the mental prep mental prep for before fought I think for me. I just need to like I like to be in control with my with my boxing. Yeah and like you get that through your training that when it comes to thinking about the fight. I've I've been in track sessions before and you get to the last couple of sets of for hundreds or something like why am I doing this? And I think for me the mental thing is I just want to I want to be at the World Championships or I want to I want to go to if you think about that goal that you want where you want to be or or why you're doing it is because I want to go to Worlds and that's where I struggled last year. Yes because obviously called games and come through for me. So I was doing track sessions like Midway through the year you get to the last 70 available. Why the fuck am I doing is it really worth it? And you don't have that big goal if this is this is why yeah, and I think just thinking Thinking back to what your goal is and why you're doing this war when you're in those tough sessions that for my mental prep. And as far as got into the ring, I think I let me just jump on that one there because there was another question throwing that somebody said when training gets tough what motivates you I suppose you've just answered that as well in the same question when when you're running on the track and you're done you on your seventh 400 millimeters in you just absolutely fucked and you've got three to go. Well, what does get you through? I suppose you've answered. Boy having that going funny. Would you say that you just just holding a cell and and knowing that? People around the world on as fortunate as me and I have this opportunity to like we can run on pristine tracks. Yeah, we get recovery. Yeah, that's right everything. Give it like I'll give it to us, but it's there if you will have access to all these things and why should be taking advantage of that when my opponent maybe he's from 100 gram Russia Ukraine, maybe they don't have that opportunity anywhere. I need to find that hunger that they have just to do box here. And I know you would have seen that when you had to Cuba where boys have had Got Runners on and hearten. I remember are complaining about you know, Helena three sets of boots. Yeah. Yeah. That's right. Yeah, exactly. It's just about putting things into perspective. I remember we went over there with Luke Jackson the Bella boys the Maloney boys. There was Jason whateley there's quite a few Hoops Cameron have it has a really good team is a good team boys. It's a pretty good team given guys. Like we were our guys were giving away Runners to these Cuban Guys and some of them work. Cutting there were two smaller. They had them they were cutting holes in the end of the shoe. So they the toes would fit through it. It's unreal, and that's why you got to find out so hungry, but they're so hungry to win a fight because they need to get out of that situation. And I think I've gotta find that's what motivates me to be better because I've got everything like Australia was so great. We're so blessed and we should be grateful for what we have here. So you need to Look at your own situation that I'm here. I need to push hard as hard as these boys are in the welder if I'm going to compete with you nice. Oh, yes, I suppose. What was the second part of that question? Yeah, when you are suppose you're going from your dressing room to the ring. What's on your mind then, you know what's in your mind. I just I'm like, I guess people take their differently, but for me, I just like to be relaxed and I'll actually go through my punches go through much stretching and And I like to talk and have conversation and you know, I like to joke around a bit one before I get into the ring but constantly reminding myself that just giving myself the confidence. I've done the work. Yeah, I remind myself that I'm on this level. Yeah, I feel I'm better than these people and that's just all in my head whether the fight goes that way or not. I told herself before every fight. Yeah, you're the man, you know, it's yellow and it has to be that way sometimes. Well, I think a lot of times remember when you were a bit younger and you're a Jew, you know, he looked up and watched a miracle all the time. You just love these starving. You did any sugar in the gym together. Remember? I used to just say to you before every fight Hooper attitude who braditude and it was all the time. It was like because he had this attitude at a young age that he could beat anybody in the world where a lot of people don't they have that fear and they let the few beat said, yeah. Well sorry to cut you off but that confidence for me didn't come until I was probably Bleah 79 in but maybe even 1890, you know, you just you have those first few late fights at ya. And ya I call I am I going to be strong enough with these boys and then after it, I forgot fights and I'm spying on people like Damian who parole murder? Yeah. Well great. Carol home like jock Pros. What what's to say? I can't go in here and why shouldn't I be confident when these boys at the pro level yea unreal. Yeah, that's right. And when I come back to the amateurs it so I take that confidence from those. Pause and I've done the work and yeah, that's that's that's that's perfect. So I so write your so let me take you back to again this one, right? So you've that's the way you think right. Normally. We have a bit of a we have a little hug at the bottom of the stairs from that time to actually Stepping up actually walking up the stairs the next 15 seconds after the walking up the stairs stepping through the ropes standing in the corner move it around what's on are you thinking much then or you just it's time to do this is the love it. Yeah, let's just use living that moment that I've done everything. Yeah. I always get I always get a little bit nervous like before that moment. Yeah. Is your hug Yara you and then I walk in there. And the first thing I do is they'll big big lap of the range. Just you know, like this is It's nowhere This is where yeah, I did my work and then get back to the ring. I usually do the sign of the cross. Yeah, and then from probably the first 10 seconds. I'm a little bit. I'm really cautious. Yeah, and then from then on I just know it. Hi you guys it's my game. That's what I've trained hard for so nice. So another part of that question. What are your thoughts during the fight? I if I was answering that this is not a throne of me obviously, but if I was answering this, I would say it's constantly changing. And it's it's living in the mou Hazard. Yeah, you have as soon as you get it in that you have to adapt to every circumstance under way. So if like when I get in there, I might even try like a couple fights just to see what tactic might work. Yeah, because if I faint and he cut his backhand And he reacts differently to what I expected then your whole game phone's going to change a little bit like you're talking to change the whole it'll change that little bigger and you don't know what they're gonna throw so you're trying you faint and then as soon as that confidence just builds and builds that by like people say that my Instagram highlights of May draw from my hands. And and I think we've got a question here somewhere and there was a bit about like Drop. Why do you drop your hands in your fights? And I've seen are you here boxing with your hands down? Is it a stir? All you've taken to yes, I shorten that question. But because I got direct message on Instagram about that is I see in your training videos how your practice with great technique and like as we do here at the gym. And and when you punch the bag you don't drop your hands or when you're done your Shadow, you don't drop your hands, but in your fights, it seems like you do but in my highlights only show that that fans. How many how many times in that first maybe two minutes of the round you see me with my hands up. Yeah, I never happens. It doesn't happen. America's got a as I can get caught up and one my reflexes and my tactics haven't come along that earlier than that because I can't do the things I need to do. Yeah, as far as the van that one thing we've always said I'm out of all I said that to you is live from other people's mistakes. Yeah. Well, I've been in this gym with some of the pedigree of people boxes with hardened Damien Cameron Hammer. Yeah. I've got to learn are some of the best you you Olympians that Australia's producer Last probably 10 15 years. I've I've always been cautious of getting caught early. Yeah, and then as we said and the same that we've seen that energy and that can happen to anybody and it's a shame of it happens to someone but I've just got to take that is a learning experience. Yeah, that's right while I'm still a mature to you is I know once in turn pro and you put on those small gloves and yeah my mistake. Laughs. Yeah, I just can't get caught up. Yeah, that's hot. Yeah, that's good. So what we're should we got next? Okay. Well, let's try this one. This is a bit. What's your favorite part of all time to watch like what fight excites you and you can just watch it all the time for me. I don't watch that that much of the old-school boxing. Yeah as much as maybe people think assured I am I'm just I love this. Yeah. Well, it's the generation. Yeah, I've grown up in is but how many times do you watch a full fight now or you probably would but my generation is all right. Well, what's the quickest access? I'll watch five minutes or highlights your I can pretty much do everything. So like on-demand. Yeah, it's the world's different. Well was that the the best fight like I've seen recently for me that I actually got like a big feeling from was the Triple G Canelo the first one. Yeah, I didn't think Triple J. Yeah, the decision I thought he did enough to win but that forcefully like I was standing at what else have you ever checked a box of yellow and even before that I am like the fights that actually got me up and excited by have to be like watching it live in the yeah. Yeah, you have to I think yeah, and another one for me was obviously when Jeff Horn one I was not aware. Why would I mean there was yeah. It was amazing because I was like you just wanted him to win so bad and even I don't know was it Jason the line? He's last. Adding is under last night. Yeah. Yeah for that against all the cheese is it's can't remember the name, but I remember watching it and in that super seriously, / I watch that and I would have called you. I thought I was a cracker absolute cracker, but that's as far as my favorite fighter of all time. Yeah, I haven't watched too many the classics apart from highlights. Obviously, like obviously control watch like Micky Ward. Yeah, Tara Gaddy Trilogy and the Marquez Pacquiao fight. Yeah, that was well what what let's flip that around. What's what's the favorite fight of yours that you've been involved in might be when you are ten years old. It might be last fight favorite right fight the view of had whether You've Won or lost because this the question come from somebody. So whether You've Won or lost what is your favorite fight you've had and why is it it's a you beat the odds you you got belted and it was the best Learning lesson because let's be honest. You had a few losses early on like everybody got lost. Are you going to ask her about maybe 25 so I probably would have been even tent and you know and the like as a young kid, that's that's a frustrating thing. Yeah. Yeah, and that's probably why I didn't invite them to come watch me for a long time as because we're confidence wasn't there. Yeah as a boxer because because then you might think you got belted. Yeah, you know, I don't want to box here. And yeah, it sounds like that's never a just Russia House and what am I supposed to do? Like, I've only been taught the Box Get put in with good boxes, and I was fine. Yeah, but answer made the biggest something that stands out something stands out. Well not too short to be honest. I think fighting over you not Germany for the first time. Yeah anything for me. I think that was probably the biggest learning experience as far as like, we did the New Caledonia trip. Yeah early on which was good, but just going there and it slowly. Yeah and then fighting in Germany against people like I'm on the set. Second fight night we had there. I remember every on this is like like I thought the hometown kid and everyone was against me and that was something different for me because I've only for differs but yeah, well, I thought it'd be afforded like Sydney or something. Yeah, I like is a few people but no one really not really it's yeah, that's why this atmosphere was like every other again and I thrived on it. I loved it. Yeah, that was probably the biggest learning. I for me and he was a man. I thought I was 19 at the time. It was a 2015 was 19 at the time that that was a big change. So I'll admit I took Confidence from that trip to come back here. And then I remember we went to China for that training camp Nationals and I had a really good National yet as well. Yeah, that's right. That's probably the biggest one I learned from and being in with a man. Do you credit do you enjoy that you enjoy the well, obviously 2017. We ran the elite boxing championships as well, which is on television on ESPN every week. It was on for 10 weeks and that was you know, that was a big thing. NG where I personally said let's do this because everyone said you can't get amateur boxing on television. So I've just got two more fuck this. Let's have a crack and we got the sponsors. We sold tickets would use everything and it was amazing. But what we wanted to do with through that we wanted to give the boxes the special field the lights the camera the action that smokescreen the interviews the everything that Pros fight and you know, what amateur boxing over three rounds with no head guards on anymore. Why wouldn't you watch it? Yeah, it's exhausting table is reponsible. Remember every week nearly every maybe twice a month. Yeah or once a month. We're fighting the best. Yeah, which is against the best amateur. That's not it's not old late. Yeah. I did not will payments on five hundred bucks a head driver from yeah the Philippines like this is their actual really good boxes. Yeah over-50s yet fight fighting each other and they're like, yeah, that's right. Yeah, there's a that was ABC really helped me with that as well. Just don't get interviews and get a confidence in that I'm ready for this next look at guys. Yeah, and for me like as you know, the amateurs is I'd love to go to the Olympics. Yeah, and that's the goal. The goal is world champion yet then Olympics, but for me, the Ultimate Golf is to toe professional become a world champion. Yeah, and I love the show you love people Everyone watching you and yeah and the lights and cameras the action. Yeah, and I just think everything's good with timing and doing everything the right way. We can have that when we go pro but to have it while I was still a She was a beauty that's what we couldn't it was also like I'd have feel the boys come down watching. Yeah, and to see what it's about and to see what if I turned down a beer. This is probably why yeah, you're not sure I believe so he speak about turned down me up. You've had a few birthdays. We haven't even celebrated haven't even know school is because a boxing and that sort of stuff. Yeah hundred percent. I had no no schoolies. So I'll send the exact. No schoolies 1808 And then like the big ones 21st as well. No 25 I had to make it was for so that leads us into more questions that get thrown out us your big goals of it where you've discovered that one. That's another question immediately. It's World Championships championships Olympics given everything goes to plan and then after amateur boxing amateur boxing is finished. It's where we going. Away, yeah luck for me. That's always been a big goal. And are you going to be world champion? Yeah, of course said that's what I want. Excellent. That's it. And you just do the right thing. We you know stepping up at the right time and the right because everything's time and for me as we said about the entertainment side of Roxy. Yeah, when I turned Pro, I don't want to just be a lot like you got to do you reproduce you're going to Paris. But yeah, like I want to be able to run it the way I want to run it. I don't know. I just get stuck in in the norm of Australian boxing which is just Farting in and no Showmanship no entertainment or no reason for people to come watch you and that's why I'm trying to build it while I'm still amateurs. That's why I put the highlight videos out and just trying to do different things. It's not my differently. It's happening just in my tummy feels like an extra people might come watch me. Yeah, but it's ten that weren't there if I wasn't I wasn't putting myself out there because that's how people should think. Yeah. That's what I told you young Fighters want to see them now so a couple of the boys last week at the fight. Got the Gold Coast. I told them when when they're doing their social media stuff. I think it's it's such a good thing to see young boys problems out there to to promote themselves that and by the time they're my age now, they'll have one my 5,000 more people that want to come watch over you and what I do now. Yeah, because if I had my time again, I would have I would have been a Relentless with it. Yeah, because I think if you hesitate to put yourself out there, then you're never gonna get anywhere. Yeah. And and to see those young boys doing that. It's I think they and they feed off that confidence that if I say that's a I don't know in might not know and then it is ok, as you looked up to others. It's now you're tellin ya because their social media is really more my age. Now then say yeah the boys before me so they couldn't really give me game on that. But now I want to kind of try and help them out as well because I think as As a young kid you hesitating even I used to when I was about 15 16. If you post a photo after you win I'd get so hesitant about putting it up. Well now these boys are just like putting training videos up years misfiring videos. Here's just content for people to learn what's going on and it's taken me how many years to be able to do that. So and they've got to be smart with it though or making yourself look good doesn't mean you don't destroy the other people, you know what I mean? Some people it's all about like You know, you can put yourself out there you put you know, you should be putting pumping out content all the time to improve yourself get what you're worth. But you know, you don't you just going to the people who have to do the right thing and these young kids using it. It's great to do it. They need to push it hard. They don't need to be bagging others as they do it themselves. It's about them and their supporters and building what they do and you know what life's about relationships. If you're good to people people will give it back to you and I think that comes back to you your own character as well. If you're if you're willing to do that and like I'm just saying put your content out there. You can kind of see us. Yeah, if you put a little bit of a highlight of you give it to someone but don't be disrespectful with it. That's right. Yeah, and a lot of the times I can put up a video of Me Maybe putting someone in a town. Yeah, but it's the it's the message as well. Yeah, like I'm not putting captions up like yeah come get this or like yeah, who was that the shit out of that, but that's not me either if that's you go for it, but it's The contact we expect the backlash from that you shine parts and you just got to be smart and educated and we what you do on social media because people can take things the wrong way. Oh, yeah. Everyone's offended these days as well. That's right. Here should be really careful. Yeah. No, I think you're doing excellent with it. Yeah, and I and I think that for me that's not really my character. Like I'm I'm confident in my ability, but I'm not going to go out of my way to your master question. I'll answer it but I'm not gonna go out of my way to put Else down or you don't come back soon. So inspiring to all these professional and Australia was I said, like like I'm happy to talk and be confident. Yeah, but and he goes, yeah, but just never break your own character and I think and that's where he's I learned a lot from that conversation was you know him telling me that you don't need to break her at character to be successful. Yes. What and I think that's that's true people like in a low and yeah. Yeah anniversary. Like if he gets asked the question, yeah, I'll answer it. I'll beat that person, but he doesn't go out of his way to be a dick about just yeah detrimental was disrespectful. So I suppose off that what's your best advice in you boxer to a new boxer obviously has lots of guys in our gym and in gyms all over the world that they you know, they might look up to people like your your early twenties now lucky you looked up to people and their you're still looking up to people in your state. You still do but to a young kid that wants to start wants to be a Big tall boxer what would you say to them apart from that obviously give advice to Young Box about their social media what they should and shouldn't do what else what other advice would you give to young person? I just just be yourself with as far as what we're talking about. There was being yourself and just back yourself as well. You've got a but I don't think when I was really young I didn't back myself as much as I should have not as confident as I should have been and I've only Gain, that confidence as like through being an adult and yeah. Yeah, I'm good boys as yeah to be confident and back your own ability, I think and that's the thing I are you know, a lot of people want to be Mike Tyson. I want to people like Bill want to be Muhammad Ali. You know, what there's one of them. There's one of you so you be that you be good at your you be good. You be a good you if your name's Jim you be a good gym. Yeah, you be a good Jack you're not I mean, don't me don't try to be Mike Tyson? Yes, we can always learn off almost The moment from that even just when I first started I watch Boxing concert. Yeah, and I just adapted little things from every once every from stars that I liked and even stars and maybe I didn't find entertaining but they were good at what they did. Yeah, I would take from that and had its my own game. Yeah, which I'd probably give that advice as well as watching much content on your own but boxing. Yeah as you can and not just not just professionals like if that's what you like, but it is still a matured watching amateur boxing. Constantly as well. Yeah, there's some good averages that you get good entertainment from the market. You look at the Cuban say that Stephens recently. They really got haven't even the Stars like yeah you adapt so you might some fights you might get away and fighting like a cube at all. Yeah, but then you might need it like a Ukrainian or European style and to help you. I'm be more active or get on the inside at mid-range more instead of just putting. Yeah, the shock humans do like you've got to be able to Adapt in any situation you put that shot. Yeah, everyone's every different and and what exactly on you as well when you know, a lot of times people see I you you have your hands down. We know that you've broken the mold then when you start your fight, it's always perfect. Yeah, because and you try and get the momentum to swing that's what that's what the Gap is. That's what we're trying to do. But when you box in Fiji your hands didn't leave your face because yeah because he was a he was a warrior here. Hard Punch and kid and you box into a give it a lot of people don't see those things. We didn't have any video over there or anything like that. That's what I end up putting down four times. And yeah, yes for one crayon or point three times. Okay. There's a question here. It's a tough one. I think do you have a favorite punch that you like to throw a punch that I like to throw? Road to hurt people. Yeah, which is obviously the left rear. Yeah like a yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah and I love watching people throw that. Yeah, but doesn't me your performer pint? Yeah my favorite punch to punch like to throw and land. Yeah, probably is that long long right here along right here. If you ever watch them. You've also got Roy Jones with his lead. Yeah Ducks under. Yeah. I just think it just looks so good and I remember seeing Damien who fears the throttle unreal? I think I think he in the Olympics he hit Marcus Brown with them found branded. The house is coming from stories. Yeah, I think for me that punch that lady right here to land and throw em what to throw and land it and then be able to like screwed off. I think that yeah, I get a little bit out of that. Yeah, but if every shot I love the left but let's not forget to the body. I love watching review happens through that, but I don't know me better than that guy. It's not on me. I'm happy for you. Mr. Rawat, I think but I've only started really watching that since I've probably been about seven eight. Yeah. Yeah and ever since I watched it and thrown it. Yeah, I don't think there's a better punch lot to took. Yeah and hearing that For example, that's a little bit of confidence a lot of time. You get it again, you get it again six rounds, but when you're when you're in an amateur fight, it's a lot faster. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, and I'm probably guilty of that as well. I'd rather just stay longer pick. Yeah punches winning the fight then get in there and get my head clear. That's what that's why that's why the amateur boxing. Different game in the pro boxing it's a Sprint. You got to take your points out. You got to do your job where I think a lot of young amateurs watch a lot of Pros, but they need to watch amateurs as well class it like you just said before you need to watch top-class amateurs because the game is different. Yeah, and I like for me. Why I struggle to watch amateur boxing as much as I was surprised because I love watching the lights camera action. That's exactly what is it and you can too. I love the little things like this the ring War you you're okay. Yeah. Yeah. That's right. That's all whether you like or not have any mundane build a career on people not liking him. Yeah, it's here. You made it to the show the show that people get dragged into. Yeah, and that's the thing. I love watching that but I know myself that's not me. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah for sure. I do like so another good question. I thought from somebody sent through what life lessons are what is boxing taught you about who you are what you know your life lessons in boxing a thing. Confidence hmm. Just having come from the confidence and relentlessness to do things. Yeah, and not be scared of what might happen after or and just backing my own ability to do things. Well, I think when I started boxing even through school like you just be sitting in class and you know, something like I'll go your way and I just I know in my own ability I can Smart enough to do things, you know, I'd like my grades picked up as soon as I started boxing and I was at the gym more than I was and school. Yeah pretty much but my grades picked up because I wanted to do it so bad and I remember here I got really sick and I'm so glad he loves this boxing because he's got a piggy school grades up or he's not coming and then, you know, I'll sit there for half an hour watch Boxing when I got home from training and then after that I'm sitting down and doing homework, and I don't got better. - confidence and resilience. Yeah as well like how many times up he made of times I've had, you know things don't go my way in there any more decisions don't go away and you just you just have to push on him. Yeah, and I think resilience with massive even like you might not get the job you want I suppose you've answered a few of these questions here like all E1. Like there's another question after losses. Why'd you stick to boxing? And why do you think It's worth it world. It's because the big goal is so much bigger and you know what you're chasing a loss is a speed bump. It's fucking terrible at times or and as not stopping you from where you going is it, you know, it's not going to stop you and the losses like although they might see the weight of the world to me. There's people going through bigger battles and me and I think you've got to look at that. Sometimes like appreciate this is this has happened but I've got to use this and I really pushed myself forward and And keep going. Yeah, for sure. I think in the long run like if there's this likewise boxing worth it is one of those questions there and I think it's worth it in the long run for me because I know like an amateur game. I know things might not go away but I just got to keep pushing on. Yeah, because I know in the pros I will be able to make the dough for myself and I will be able to do what I want to do and I just think for me that's just inevitable. That's just going to happen once being This is what happens is we have just left doing your kind of shit. Yeah, if I fuck up along the way but you know, you're gonna get your apprenticeship and you're going to give a try to you know, it's gonna happen for you know, like obviously want to make money and do things with boxing outside of just getting belts. And yeah, that's right. I want to make money as to kill myself and not sure my family, but that's how you got to set those big goals. You know me a reason, you know reason is because you want to be the world champion, but you I want to have everybody else's dream. You want your dream of I'm going to do something with it. I'm going to you know, whatever you can do with the name that you build yourself and scratch, you know, it's like recycling communities, you know, come out of box it like boxing sort you so many lessons. How many male is he and just to be relent like resilient with your own business. I don't doubt. This has been a smooth run running your own gelfling off and coming up with ideas. That might go against the grain at times. That's right. You just got to do it. You have to think outside the box. And be prepared everyone's gonna have an opinion on something because he's gonna kill you on the event will get scared with that nowadays. Don't they like yeah hundred percent, especially with social media. Everyone's happy to say shit on social media, but you know what, you just gotta that's their opinion or wouldn't even hear it if there was no social media, so it doesn't really matter. Yeah, and then the date they're following you. Yeah, that's right. If you don't like it, it's pretty easy just to leave it. You know - yeah. Yeah. Yeah, so, okay. So what's a week once a week for you? What's a general weekend as far as you try to do we look like so we're trying to three times a day for a 6/6 up six days a week. Yeah that'll include strength training. So strength and conditioning is done at the community actually to two sessions. They're in good hands down there. So To strengthen Khan, and then I do about three three full like running sessions. Yeah, that'll either be a long distance may not too long at this stage because we're coming into States probably be about what you do. You think they got a case tops when it's pretty cruisy. Just keep the weight down on it. And then you have you just Pacific you're running specific sessions with on the track, which can be short or long. Hundreds of 405 comes gets closer and I feel fit we shorten the distance has up. And so yesterday we when we do yesterday, I hate 685 had 600 years ago and then you obviously you give us the X and here it's going to head up and the rest period shortens a little bit each week. So yeah, it's always fun. That's probably the worst session for that. I think at the moment usual six boxing sessions. Yeah. We do to add special to and then was a bit more extra sessions with the group sparring sessions in there. I'm fine pretty regularly. So I think expiring will be there but I don't think it's a massive concerned. I think more the partner working partner were killing it feels up. That's right. The strength of otherwise found it's a hard thing for me to do. Yeah, but to get that motivation to go but you just have to do it as part of the pilot process and same with track tracks the same lie. I've never really enjoyed track but on yesterday. We saw some kids aren't there first time didn't we and you know, I remember when I first saw that you were exactly like those kids yesterday like but you actually hop on that you just couldn't find that cruise control as well. You got to know your own body and How to make the font remember we did attract station there with think it was over and there's a few other boys there Heidi Murphy most not all over the bad haul was just bad holes an Olympian. It used to trying it out Jim Commonwealth Games representative as well. But we one of the people I looked up to when we're was boxing and when he was boxing and he said to me watch me hit I think we did eight hundred and we did six eight hundreds and we had to hit one. 30 laps and you had to hit three minutes and he goes Watch Me Hit the time every time as I had seen. Oh, he's gonna hit the time but he just done it that many times and he knew the pace and how did he wasn't fit at the time but he just knew and and yep shit, you're not every time it was three minutes three minutes. Even on the doctor. I'm probably the last year and a half two years. I've learned how to just know the pace and don't know when to push and when I went to rest and that's a go. Cease firing as well. Yeah, it's okay. I might be able to I might be able to work in close here. Then when I come out I can maybe walk around the ring and just little things that those things are picked up from those experience boys like that horror and carry home was just there ring generalship and there yeah and their ability to train but not overdo it. Yeah, just do what's do what's necessary I suppose. Yeah. I suppose the last question that we will finish off with. Your biggest inspiration who what's who's a role model to you within like boxing itself? Stylistically always loved Amy Hooper or watched him. Yeah, and he was in our gym as well. So I got to watch him train and Spa. He was always a massive influence in a gym, but then there's also boys like like I've mentioned Brad for Kerri ho yeah Cameron having this here for as well Patty Murphy. Rowan your own bed off your other than some spine with round and round groans help me along the way but in life life, obviously Mom and Dad yeah. Yeah, they've helped their work ethic and the way they go about things is really helps me puts me in good stead to know that like some of the things that I do I couldn't do it. I couldn't even work a job. Jonno gets up and Dad. Yeah, right. We'll get up at four o'clock in the morning. He won't finish the day till 5:00 at night and then he'll come drive the boxing come and watch me try and and then come home because and he gets home by 9 o'clock at night. And these rally girls chase dogs for three days. Yeah and mums the same mum will get up do everything like for me and my sister and she's just a great person as well. I think you're wise be grounded. I hope they wouldn't let that one eye you fake come off the ground thinking. It's so fucking lucky back down pretty quick. I started I can imagine but your mom and dad massive Inspirations of just the way they go about things that are so selfless. Yeah, they put at everyone else before themselves. Nice month Mom, especially month an angel but and my sister obviously as well. Yeah. This is a massive inspiration like to see it the situation she's been in and the battle she sat down overcoming her own wife chance to explain. A little bit about that or what you would like leave it a little bit but it's just battled her whole life and she struggled the way she goes about things is she's just like with just such a resilient character. Yeah, and if I could be half the person she is yeah, I'd be in good stead to be good like a good good role model for younger kids and she it's just the way she goes about everything like she might get faced with something like especially when she was younger. Yeah and like, you know her know her strong. As well so it before come games. She had a situation pop-up and and without a blink of an eye. She's like, all right, we'll just deal with it. That's my mom instead. I'd rather people that are normally inside. Yeah, and she was just like, okay Steve what's know just like that's just her attitude about everything in life. And I think I've taken that and transfer that into my boxing. We're obviously Olympics didn't come for it world champion says one of championships hasn't happened for me before. Yeah Commonwealth Games mr. App and you Just look at her situation. You're like like like if I can't get over there. Just can I put it on life - that's right. Yeah, my buddy works. Yeah. What what's to say? I can't just get over this and it should just be able to ride with it. Yeah, she's training itself. Now she's doing excellent. She's training down here reckons. She's the best boxer in the family shit. That's a g. And then again, your mom says that to the Those three of my biggest Inspirations as as far as nice outside of boxing. Yeah, I can transfer that into my boxing as well and then obviously people are mentioned an office helped along the way yourself Shara. It's like a family down here. So it's just you guys inspire me every day to come and be a better person and and of as you said just kept me grounded, you're not hot so you don't let me go big head or not. That is anything we get a big head about but you know, like some people have a few fights that they think Yeah, after five flights. I thought I was yeah, I didn't think I was that good actually because I was always about but like I wonder if he flies in your Bait A couple boys in your car. I'm not too bad and then you think it didn't get chucked in with Hooper and you like maybe look like yeah, we haven't even scratched the surface. Maybe I need to learn a bit more about you and share of changed my life being down here. So now I appreciate you guys having me riots its axon lat. Oh, right. I think that's excellent. I think we've whether we've directly or indirectly answered all those questions of people through I think everyone should be pretty happy with that. And that was great. Jackass. So under the under the big year now, we've got you got it you can are fewer games. You got state championships who got a strange championships with oil championships. It's pretty big year the Year coming up. I feel good for I feel confident you boxing really well at the moment. The people have seen your locally and quite a lot of people from you know, Interstate are actually saying you you know, you're going well at the moment so look like we said we just keep your feet on the ground as as they have to be. Anyway. Otherwise, there's the door. Okay, you know, so doors always open. That's right. So Mike thanks for that today often people get a lot of a lot of knowledge out of that especially a lot of young people or people that have been unsure if they're boxing there in that middle ground at the moment might be struggling with a bit of mental preparation or whatever. It might be. I think overall I think one a message you've said is you know, what doesn't matter what happens decide you just keep going. So please don't just being resilient with it. That's not going to be able to there's going to be setbacks along the way but you just got to keep pushing forward and I just been confident Relentless with your own. With put yourself out there and believe in yourself. Do I know you're not going to love every single training session I can I could name it at five this week. But but you know, what if you desperately want that big gig, it's like it's not I say the kids are attention all the time. Yeah fucking rocket science how to be successful. You've just got to work harder than everybody else to work on. Yeah. It's it's like you said on the track the other day have how many of those boys were struggling and a couple of the girls are struggling as well? Well, I was I wasn't struggling because I've worked so long and I just I hate it when people say oh but yeah, he's a good runner. Why is he good runner because he fucking runs that's it. And I because he sit on the couch eating chips. Although there is some people on that they didn't run away. Uh, yeah. I don't think I'm built for that. No ours. All right jack. Thanks very much. We'll wrap that up good man. Thank you. Thank you.","– It's not every day a boxer gets the chance to fight for Australia, but that's exactly what happened to Jack Bowen on Saturday. The 23-year-old, who was born in Queensland and grew up in a working-class neighborhood in Melbourne, went into the ring to take on New Zealand's Danny Williams for the vacant World Boxing Council International welterweight title in Brisbane, reports the BBC. It was a huge step up for Bowen, who was already a two-time Australian Amateur Boxing Association champion and a two-time Australian Football League champion with the Western Bulldogs. But it was a big step down for Williams, who lost his world title to Joseph Parker in 2015 and was last year stripped of his WBO world title for failing to submit in the 10th round, per the Guardian. ""I was a bit disappointed,"" Williams tells the BBC. ""It was a good fight, but he's a world champion, so I was expecting a good fight."" Bowen, however, wasn't expecting such a big step up. He started boxing at the age of 13 after getting injured while playing AFL, and ""it can get a bit full-on sometimes and just to have a balance with mates playing a team sport as well was good,"" he told",0.16487455197132617,0.1146953405017921

Hey, have you heard from Aid? Oh, yeah. Yeah, they message which I guess is not important. Exactly. Yeah. Hey, it's from Aidan. Oh, no, I thought they were offering me a job. That's that's how I remember thinking when I got the message because it wasn't have you seen Aiden because it made me think. Oh, I might be getting a job. It was the show starts at 10:30 and Matt got the message out about It would have been quarter to ten. Oh, no, I didn't even get a message. I got two missed calls and they were in within 20 minutes of each other and I was like, what time were they? I thought I was thinking all that need me to come jump in like last minute. They brought by could Joe money turns out that's not the fact know the fact was Aidan had slept through his alarm buzzer and woke up at 10:44 and the show starts. Fuck. I love this story the show started at 10:30, right? So I woke up first of all, how do I know the story? I've told you what did you tell me? Well I came to this training. How is this really important? Not at all? No, I'm sorry. Oh you noticed could you fucking just fuck off, please? Sorry. Sorry for trying to make podcast better run into both of you. Shut the fuck up. Yeah, and let me just carry this podcast. No, I just quickly want to borrow for 45 minutes into whether this is important. So I woke up at 8:30 and I looked at my life and I went oh you beauty I have to be out. I have to be up until quarter past 9:00. So I'm gonna go back to sleep but didn't set a quarter-past nine alarm. Just thought I'll wake up at quarter past nine wrong. Wrong look up 1044 216 missed calls a bunch of messages from friends that aren't even involved in the podcast in the podcast in the pant. Oh, they're just people had reached out because they thought I'd died I call to they thought they'd call you. By the way. Once you get the 10 missed calls, he's not answering don't keep cool. Right? So I called Blake back and I'm like, oh my God. Oh my God. Oh my God. Oh my God. Oh my God, and he's like are you okay? I thought you were in a car accident what's going on? And I was like I slept in I'm so sorry. I'll be there in 10 minutes wrong. I'm at 15 minutes away from the from the show if I just drove there straight away, but I had to brush my teeth Etc. Yeah, so I get there right as they closed interval. So I missed the entirety of act one. Right? All of act one is pretty much just how I meet the Beast because I'm the dad and Bell has to go after because being the best they missed it. So they did me as a puppet and it was fucking terrible. Oh, yeah, and it is a bit where it's like me and the Beast but instead of doing that because they couldn't really do it. They closed the curtain and Blake the guy that's in charge said well, you know and bikes and Belle's father went off to find the Beast this It is so terrifying that week work can't show you also one of our actors did not rock up this morning. So we can't show you that either. Oh, well I get there. Oh my God. I'm so sorry. Oh my fucking God. I'm so sorry. He has now, it's alright, it's alright. We're just glad you're okay. No big deal.

Thank you. David Barton with kick bam. Aah when you send that message, did you think we would read aloud on the podcast and then we would use it as a segue into that had rain the wall. That was a point. You're a fucking genius. That is unreal. For those on the different because I sent all the other creatures probably in the right last thing is like, oh, I'll put that in that's how we can get out of there. That's a very funny. That's some good thinking that's thinking ahead. Let's take it ahead. I was it as you know, I work at JB Hi-Fi JB Hi-Fi you've done it again and I was thinking the other day we were having a bit of fun and games at work if you were stuck in a JB Hi-Fi What weapon would you if you were getting attacked you had to pick up one thing? You can't modify the thing in any way you can't take a bit of the thing. What is something that a JB Hi-Fi cells that you would use as a weapon. Now when you say modify can I modify like if there's a modifiable? For example, you can't pick up a Dyson and only use the pole you have to use the entire thing. But if Apple can be removed, can I do that? Like, I'm not. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Okay sure. I would get like one of the mic stands and just take the solid bit of metal out of it, but you take Metal rod. Yeah, I think that's a solid weapon. What do you recommend porn fridge? Yeah. Yeah. It's distracting with the porn then push the fridge on them old smells like come on. It smells like called. Come on. It smells like crazy cold come. Well, it smells like crispy cold crazy come more smells like crazy Clark's Chris be cold. Come like my client clay crazy Clark's crispy. A cold cow the name of my client crispy Clark Garf my God, I reckon I was thinking originally I thought a Dyson pole. That's what I thought because it's just a piece of aluminum and aluminum aluminum, but I did then was brought to the attention of a just a massive copper wire because you have like AV cables are made of copper. Mmm get into spin it this whack people in the head whenever the best one. No because I don't think I don't think I Could handle that as efficiently as I could handle us. And also can you really stop someone with it? Because once you whip, the ones that are like an extension cord around the ankle or something you have it but then once you're within range once you get past the tip of it, yeah, then you just like it's just something to choke you with. I guess like I'm sure numchucks are a better weapon than a stick but in my hand Chi is useless totally useless the same way I think swinging a bit of wire like that takes it that's like it's like it takes a bit of aiming a bit of red. Them you stand out of range until the shoulder gets tired. Yeah, I love the American viewers probably buy guns. It's an electronic store isn't and I don't have any type of gun right next to the Vodka. Do you sell toys has no no guy came in and wanted a police scanner so I can work at her Polito which people are whatever I can so you can put a top on it and then just print out some copies. Speaking of Americans buy copies because we because Kanye and scanner. You just scanning. Yeah. I thought you were sending yeah was like it was like sort of like a double layer joke like a an onion before I forget the none cake we can come back to the to the poor choice, please. No, but I don't want a fucking forget this the girl that we've spoken about this girl in Breyer was set a name who the one who did ya respond to my message when I graduated, uh, and who it was the vibrational existence as a bit of a wanker on Facebook. I just learned something. Better the other day looking at a story because I check a story all the time. It's endless content. What do you know? Sometimes she talks in an American accent? I'm not surprised fucking disgusting. Honestly. I'm not fucking surprised when I heard that's yuck bright. It's happened every few days now like the other one. She said she was like, I'm like, I'm Legit now, you know, like it was described live there. Sometimes it's not that she's honest. She's in a Melbourne are she's like get it. All she does is other one where she every time she's drinking something. She raised her eyebrows and she goes and hits the phone with her drink and then takes a sip it goes. And does this fuck I'm going to show you a fucking dumbass God. She makes me mad anyway, she uh, so she's put this one. He's like, hey guys going to the gym today. Can't wait to go to the gym. I can't do it. I said New Zealand accent not that Janet whatever. All right kind of the gym and then she gets back. I'm just like I just want to respond to the people who are criticizing that I was sweating so much at the gym and it's not like she's playing a character. She's just doing an American accent and she's like I work hard. Okay, I work hard and I sweat. I'm not like usual girls next one first. Who the fuck was commenting on how much he sweat? So she just wanted to say something and she and she comes in and out of that all the time and it's like can you just comment on every time she posts on just go? No one cares this end? No one cares. No one cares. Hey guys, it's only you know, no one cares. Hey guys, it's me Miranda. She fucking respond to that. Yeah, you guys just wanted to say to all the people who say no one cares if people actually do care. This is my journey May Journey Through the vibrational existence that we call. Planet Earth. Okay, because one of those stories on the stream and I nearly vomited I was like look, why is she doing this? It's fucking it's horrendous. It is a horrendous person. She switched out of an accent Tink. It's like people go overseas for 2 weeks and come back with an accent and they're like, yeah, it's just shut onion wanker and you stain on the earth fucking cunt like a piece of shit smooth transition and Afraid you came back. He was in England for like a year and I take a guess. It wasn't I wasn't carbon because carbon Airways like little hats and stuff. I had a friend a little hat back in the day. It was just like flat cap like a paperboy hat. Yeah, like a big key finder be like Cockney or something. And I think you fucking blind be assumed to go that in the UK and he came back and he had an accent. He's like, oh, how's it going? We always went no one's buying it. What are you fucking doing? He didn't like another half an hour and I just have dropped it. That's worse. That's way worse. You gotta commit to it. It's a fucking it's a hefty thing to like, I'm just And spend the rest of my life like this. Are you might and then drops it? Yeah, yuck is like it wore off actually must have a personality now roasted toasted. So did you come up with a weapon for JB? Hi-Fi? Yeah. He said a free. Yes, the low low prices. That's my weapon. I'd like to start a new segment that won't come in every now and again, but welcome to the first segment of did I Overreact but happen Adept M&Ms and I'll do something for it Captain. I'm here it is. Here's the thing for ton of react. Anyone, oh my god. There you go. Anyone cannot down but anyone can use that by the way, if you have a did I ever react feel free to jump if anyone would like to send it. Did I run over but that's a great. I'm so close. Why am I so loud? And so close all the sudden? He's my did I overreact what we go. Now when this week comes from GMAT in Melbourne. We were we were at the pool me and Becky Fuel and they're in the pool. There's Our schools in the lane in the medical lap pools. There's like to slow Lanes to medium Lanes Too Fast Lanes and then like multi-purpose lines everywhere. And there was there was a couple guys in there was like two friends in the fast lane and a lady in the multi-purpose line. How is let Life in the Fast Lane ha ha ha. I don't know I didn't ask and how and so we jumped into the we just we just jumped into or I jumped into the medium line and she jumped in the slow lane. So we're side by side. Mmm. There was no one else there was the middle of the day in during the week and I was like, whatever that's fine and we're going Going and then I would go and I'm a very good swimmer. Okay, I'm quite fast. All right, and I'd go and I'd come back and I'd see back down and I'd stop and I don't swim and go with her for a little bit and then I go and do some more laps and at one point she was going to come down to a light but as a hundred meter pool and so she just stops. It's like I'm not doing another light. I need a bit more of a break before I try that again. She swims back and then the life of God comes up to us and says guys if you're going to be stopping while you're in the lanes you'll be blocking people's and we don't allow that so you'll need to move to the multi-purpose Lane. What and I was like I understand it says on the board right there. There's a list of rules do not stop in the lanes. But we are the only two people apart from the other guy in the fast lane who are actually using swimming Lanes. Does it fucking matter? Yeah, and then she went away and I was just boiling a back was like you should calm down like you're being a bit over the top and I'm like, are you fucking serious? That's insane. I'm like, how small is your fucking your your your power in this world in your life that you have to come here and fuck until Two strangers that they can't stop in the middle and I get that it's the rules but does it fucking matter but you fucking dick away. Did I ever react nah, I don't know why he was still angry. I got your point across the said do you actually say? Oh, no, I didn't say you said that though. No. No, that's he didn't say I didn't say anything to her back woman. Yeah, that's why you were so angry because you didn't get it reacted. If I'd said, yes. Okay. No. No, I didn't I didn't say anything. I said, I'm sorry and then we moved on and I was like, wait, why are we why? Need to do that and it came to me bit late and then I was mad and I didn't get a chance to say anything. She kept walking up and down the pool and I was like before just to touch on our conversation earlier about 20 minutes ago. You said for us to not stop it. I just want to touch on that again that we're actually the only find me waiting for a really good swimmer. I'm stopping because I want to stop my girlfriend's in the next line if I want something I'm gonna fucking stop. All right. I'll drown you anyway. Not 50 so you minute also it's kind of shit was back stopping because she was exhausted. Yeah, then fuck off. I'm not stopping to have a fucking cup of tea. Yeah fucking piece of shit. I'm physically exhausted. Oh, thank you. Thank you. I'm glad this first segment of did I react when well, yeah. I mean you you definitely have it for too long. Yeah. Well, that's just like, yeah you did huh either say something or just let it go. You can't just you can't no don't tell me that that's possible, but that if you don't know if you don't get it. You can't just go. Well, I didn't get it out. It's true. You've got to accept the fact that you didn't get it. That is because you're choosing right now not to get it out. I didn't think of it. So yeah, but then you thought of it and then you held on to it. Either go. Okay, you know, I'm not going to do anything with this idea. So I'm going to let it go or you go I'm gonna flag her down have a couple quick words, or you can spill coffee Levi. Yeah lifeguard lifeguard how much the life of you guarding I bet your life is shit. You need a lifeguard you do much when the people are out of the pool or is it mostly water go? Guarding you doing I see no one's bought your megaphone what it's on eBay for 10 days just quickly actually like got 15 bits. Really? Yeah. How much going eBay real quick?

This is something I told Vic the other day because we're talking about she was saying, how could I know? Yeah, but you'll do anything. I didn't want to interrupt you in the middle of all gasp. She was telling me about how she had a friend in high school who? Who believed they were a druid of course back at a fucking Druid friend? And so he said in a dream he dreamt that back died young and that's a that's a premonition for what he believed what God we're talking to her talking about how she they Sky dream things and I was like, you know, it's funny because I had a friend who dreamt that if she didn't date me. She would kill me this girl. This is the girl who owned the carpet the one that the know like the thing of this girl. She it's an endless is endless stories Goldman. My favorite things about her and one of the memories we say with Ben Abruzzo all the time is that time when when we were saying making fun of it because she said Bangkok was the was the capital of Japan and we're not a fucking idiot were like, that's not right.

So anyways, she after she went she went to Ben I One Way. Yep, and then moved on a meteorite. Yeah. Yep, and she asked me out and she was but this is why she was persistent with me. She asked me out. I said no God. No, you're ugly. Oh, you didn't know no, but she was ugly. I just said I said no, it's just for the audience. I just said I said, no, thank you. No, thank you. No, thank you. Anyway more full of romance. They don't like I'm like, I'm happy just being friends. I didn't want to be that but if that's what we have for this, yeah. Copy the next day. She comes to school and I see it from the other side of like like the yard just banding towards me like in a fast pace. I'm like fuck she's coming with me and she gets to meet like this close to my face like Grime offenses. Yes. Well, I think what says we're going to be together and I was like how so and she went I had a dream last night that if I didn't get together with you I was going to murder you and I'm like, are you going to murder me sick now? I'm not going to murder you but that that's that means that we have to be together. Sometimes people have dreams and I was Like that's weird. That's a girl who doesn't know how to manipulate quite right yet besides like maybe we date. Maybe you get hit by a car. If you say no who's to say what the result of this conversation will be. Anyways, also, she is wearing a massive leather jacket. Yeah. It's like back Blackshear two guys behind a crunching and maybe you happily date me now. Maybe you date me miserably in a wheelchair. I don't know yet. Anyways, I'll see you at home neck. So that was that was something that I Yeah, that's terrifying. Is that genuinely scary? Yeah, and then later on we were on I am I'm sure it's all this in one of the podcast with you. But one time we had a birthday party for the guy who suck the drink at the carpet all these links call. It was his birthday party and was yeah. It was out in like a scout camp. So we went out camping and we try and cuz we're all 18. So it was fine. And thank God she was still ugly by the way. How was our carpet? What? It wasn't you didn't mean a vag Bush me and my girlfriend at the time had a fight and the mother of this girl hates me hates me and this girl being together. And and so we have because she's not want to fucking daughter become a murderer. Well, yeah, we had a fight and then she said come with me you need to get away from I was like, okay fine. We went and we went mother of the the mother said come with me and then we went for we're all you know, what I find takes my mind of having a fight digging my own grave quickly anyway, well, She takes me and takes me to one of the roughly behind the bushes one of the rooms one of the scat rooms and she says just come in here and talk to me and I was like, I'm drunk on my own K. Shuts the door behind me and locked me in there and she left me in there all night and I was banging on the door. She locked you in a room lock me in there without my phone with our food without anything to left me in there and and I couldn't get out and so I eventually just went to sleep because I'm like it got to the point where I'd been about four hours and I went This Woman's kidnapped me and I'm like, I am feeling unsafe by the fact that you're not gonna kill me because she's a mother Mike. I'm not gonna be in here for the rest of my life. I'm not going to die in here and the fact of the repercussions that would come on her from this event warmed me and I went fine. I'll go to sleep and we'll see how the next two months after you can't have it. How are they well wake up in the morning and I didn't say anything to her. They let me out and then I went home and I went up to my mum and I say said to her, you know what it obviously did something to my brain because I said I went up very come here. Mom something happened. It's not just personal. Yeah, burst into tears. I was like what is going on Mike? I can explain what happened and and Mum was like, okay orange like talk me down and then eventually she was going I was like, where's my mistaken for a drive and she went around there and open up my just fucking let on this woman threatened to kick the shit out of her and all this other stuff and said by birth and then there were things at the school. Yeah way to go to meetings and have to keep me and the daughter and different classes and and the mother was all there. I wasn't allowed to come to wasn't allowed to be on the council at the school anymore. All that kind of stuff fucking good that woman insane anyway, so her daughter wanted to kill me today me. What if I roll GMAT podcast really fun fucking wow. Yeah. Yeah. So was this the one who your mom let the dog ate the cake. Yeah. Yep. Why did you family's ever get along? Is this the same girl that Bruce dumped polystyrene and glitter on? Yep. Fuck a why did she stay near you? It was like one of those weird things we know when you're in a small town and you are friend. You're like I hate this purpose is not the people but yeah exactly but they're in your friend group and it's just kind of how it goes. They're all the same height. So your friends. This is no other people living in the are lagly and Mum never liked her mom because their mom was on the council the school and was always like it was like that. So Matt's mom. I think the school funding should go to big at toilets to lock boys into she be like I'm we need some parents to to volunteer at the thing. Well that turtle looks like Matt's mom hasn't done very much at all for the schools. Maybe Chic like it was like that kind of mum when she judge other people in a partying. Yeah, like also you just working for a fucking school in the middle of merope. I mean, you don't have a job. You know. My mom is a full-time job. What do you know? Don't fucking work the campaign get the fuck out of here. She did work at the candy. Of course she did so nothing else going on. She's like, I just want to be at school all the time if she was a worse I hated her. I had a turkey. Oh, she's quite capable. She sounds yeah. What's this Killer story? When done well, sorry Killer story, but I was explaining to bed. The other day that there's a girl at work. I won't say her name because I don't said that he said her name is chow mein and she had it. She was where she was kind of cool. She's like an edge law. Not an angel. What's the one where they wear like giant shoes and baggage and she's a pipe Beast child and a white adults client base. It's a type. It's like a fashion style like a billy eilish the clothes. She wears like hypebeast clothes. Is that a thing? Yeah. Yeah, Victor. I'm so honestly, I mean, I'm a 24 year old human being but I am like 89 years old. I got didn't I don't really Still know what an edge Lord is. I felt like that when I watched Tick-Tock compilations other day, I went these are these aren't funny. Yeah, like these they like I see they're kind of like Vine but I'm like these are in it. These are nowhere near as funny as line, but kids obviously find them really really funny. I'm like so many people it too many people not even just kids so many people like desperately want to be Tick Tock fast. I know I'm out of touch what I'm watching that I'm like this sucks. This isn't humor. You know, what's good Seinfeld. That was a good check. Yeah anyways, so she dresses like hot base and so so but she's got to wear a uniform like everyone else and so she had this shirt that's like three sides was probably the same size as my shirt. She's wearing these tiny skinny and goes down. Well I can ease and so I went up to her and she's young. She's like 17 or something and I went to never bigger size do I would just funny it's funny and she went I'm allowed to wear whatever I want actually and I was like, oh, okay. Sorry. I was I was just jokin. She's like anyways, so then the other night I was in charge of the store and she was in and another person was in and I saw these guys come in that were dressed like fuck it. Alright, here we go. Go on one of them is black which is what's it's a, you know, it's important to the story. Well, they're just what was the give us a call? You know, they got that they were in a hoodie and a cap and they're wearing all black and they've got the the added ass bag and chains and they've been they've got a really good people they got a speaker on them and they're playing music in that and so I went these guys are going to steal something because it's always the guys who dress like fuckheads at steal something and so I was watching them on the camera and then there was like a service thing to come down. So I had to leave and then I kind of followed them around. The store and then I went to her and she noticed I was doing so what are you doing this? I'm watching these guys because I reckon they got to steal something her friends. God Matt. They're obviously her friend and she went and she had a big garments like, you know, it's profiling right? I was like what it's like you're profiling them based on the way. They look and you assume they're going to steal something and I was like, I was like, well it kind of yeah, but I might animate and she's like no it's interesting. I'm like, I'm going to see you know, I'm not picking that dude because he's black I'm picking him because he dressed like a fuckhead. I'm like that's Nothing to do with it and she's like Mom what have you say? I'm going. Okay anyways, so then if you seems like a pain in the ass and if you suspect someone is going to steal something. You've got to know it in that kind of thing and I was like, so I get a text this morning to fuck it stole a headphones like fuck you as a exactly yeah fucking my profiling came in at work. Yeah, Didn't I was so annoyed that she was like, you're probably I'm like, yeah, I am profiling but a profiling of based on how they dress not based on the case of the what what they're doing or they are yeah or And the fact I play music all that sort of stuff so it felt so good. Good to be right. I can't express to you. We got a guy at JB Hi-Fi Cruise casual that got fired the day. It's two days before Christmas government told the story. He is such a fuck. He has his hair like imagine you just take he's got long as here, but he just spikes it all up but it's like it's not Super Saiyan. Oh, yes. He's we used to call him Sonic. The Hedgehog douche bag. Looks like Sonic the Hedgehog. That's really employment Sonic. I really like that. He he would wear like upside. Down crosses on his ears and likes it in one little desk. Like there's like deaths around the place and he'd sit there just sipping a mother for his whole shift never do anything to sort of sit around and fucking I hate him so fucking much as Sonic fucking little dumb idiot helped his friends steel $400 headphones because they were locked up with security key, but he accidentally left his security key right on the desk and then walked away as his buddies, which we knew his buddies because he was talking to them and it like Yeah fucking yeah, I'm a fucking little granny fucking toilets piece of shit. He's friends stole headphones and they were caught before they left. As I said earlier. I said to my boss like those two people steal something not knowing that Sonic and helped. So my big rust firing manager walked up. He's like empty Pockets like we don't want to empty your fucking Pockets to $400 tiny head phones in their pockets bag, whatever it was by the way, I get it there were in their pockets. That's our high priest dresses. I could fit a pair of headphones in their pocket. They weren't Hobbies man's crazy. So crazy. It's the big parachute painted.

This is a good list of the girls to avoid or girls who are damaged goods. Based on my experience. All right fellas. Now this is a patreon request. So I'm about to go in okay? Y'all take a deep thought of this and really pay attention to listen to the words that I say. One any kind of mental illness this includes bipolar borderline disorder narcissism. Learn what these are and avoid these women most of these conditions are not treatable in these women will make you make your life a living hell fellows. They really will especially if you're not red pill aware of these women will make your life a living hell to the point what you might kill yourself because the woman's nature is driving you crazy you don't There's stand why she does what she does. You go nuts. You don't understand why she shit has his you you don't understand why she flip-flops because you don't understand her feelings were always change. They never remain the same. That's something for you to always remember always remember that from the female number two. If this woman is on and anxiety or antidepressant medication. Many times at the medications you have to deal with her condition. What is her condition? She's always anxious. She's always worried drama always in the Limelight. Right. She doesn't know what the fuck she wants. She's always just going all over the goddamn Place. Her head is all over the place. She doesn't know what she wants to do. She'd party and she drinks every weekend and then when she's feeling down and depressed she'll call you to use you. Is that emotional Tampa while taking her medication? She is fucking sick. Stay away from home type of women. Okay, number three talks too much. If the girl is always talking a lot. He's always giving of herself. If she's going to giving on a level she's probably giving herself physically. right Now if a woman is talking too much, it means that she is too much into herself. Right. Let me tell you what I just said again if a woman is talking too much. It means that she is too much into herself. She is selfishly centered in she thinks that the world revolves around her when it doesn't. In actuality. It doesn't number for this one is kind of similar to number three if she's very open about her sexual past early on in the relationship. What does that tell you about? It tells you that she is a slut. Yes. Our girls are slut to the right man, but some girls are not big slut. You have quiets luch you have big slut. You have a quick sluts. You have slow sluts. Those who take it slow with you and get nastier as the relationship for seats. Right. This woman gives you all the tea in the beginning of the relationship while she slept with her. She sucked his dick ha she fucked them right that will tell you that you kind of just want to treat her like a fuck buddy because that's pretty much what she is good for it's pretty much it. That is it. number 5 That's more than two tattoos. Now. This is a big one what we must understand about the tattoos is the tattoos is a woman's escape goat from her trauma in her life the more tattoos the more trauma. What is trauma heavy shit that she's been through in our life that imprinted her in a negative way. The tattoos were helped her Escape reality, even though the tattoos have meanings those meanings bring her back traumatic. Things that went on in her life that took place in her life, whether it's sex, whether she was a slut whether she was a dancer whatever you got to remember these women are very insecure. They're always depressed and down. That's why these women need drinks after they get off work because they cannot handle straps. She can't handle stress. So she takes it out with the tattoos. Always remember that it's different from when guys get tattoos. Okay. Avoid that well, I don't know if you can avoid it here for asking her taser. So bam big but don't take her serious fellows do not take her serious. She's not someone to be taken Serious Force. He's not wife material. Okay number six multiple piercings. That bitch is a slut. She got Pierce is on her nipples preaching on her fucking eyebrows. You already know what that's the West as a sign of man. That's just a sign, you know, she can get it right away. She's been out here. You know, I'm saying she'd been out here and don't fall for them kind of tricks fellas. Don't fall for that type of chick. That type of chick is no good. She's no good. She's no good. She's not good for you. All right number 7 man fat chubby lack of discipline. Okay, she fat and she's ugly. She fat and she chuckling chuckling mean fat and yeah, but she fat and she chubby right lack of discipline one part of your life seems to lack of discipline and other parts. Writes what I wrote down. All right. If she's fat it means that she doesn't lack. I mean it means that she lacks self-discipline. She cannot take care of herself. And at least two other things she can't cook. She can't clean. Definitely can't clean definitely is probably nasty as hell. She don't even want to take care of her health the most important thing but thanks to the Sims. You know, I operate a Facebook post yesterday man. You know what she kind of she kind of was right. She was right. She said of Tiny Dick niggas is wearing is going to keep on wearing gold Magnums this stomach is going to be kept on putting in my leggings. She kind of had a point. She had a point. She had a good point. You know, why because you got thirsty ass guys out here who are going to fuck that fat ass stomach. He's gonna lift that fat stomach up and dig our guts out till she bus until he busts. He might even bus inside her that is nasty, but it gives these women to huge ego boost that she doesn't have to lose weight. So it start with us men having a mindset of this motherfucking. Woman has to lose weight. It starts with us first fellows. We have to have standards for ourself. Now if you have a fetish for fat women or BBWs, that's cool or chubby as chicks. That is cool. That's okay. but digging a fat woman God's how is fucking disgusting? Okay. She lacks self-discipline. She doesn't want to go to the gym and eat healthy. That's fucking nasty. All right. All right, eight. smokes She smokes. That is a turn-off. She Smoked Cigarettes. She smokes weed. You already know what that means. That means she gets down. She gets down with the Weed Head. She gets down with the crackheads. She might even do crack herself. Trust me. These women are not different. I mean, of course she's gonna deny it but if she smoking weed and she a hippie. Right she down Earth. Free-spirited Mansi doing all them fucking truck man. All them drugs. All right. Number nine poor skin and teeth and doesn't take care of her nails or hair. Stay the fuck away from them type of women. Man, I seen a chick yesterday man hurts. Keith was so fucking yellow. She's talking to me in her tongue was like white, but y'all will let a bitch like that suck your dick. Did BC give you herpes. You have a bumpy dick. You have a bumper dick fucking dick beta male, but we did Papa get you have a bumpy dick. That's nasty. You want a bumpy dick. Stay the fuck away from no type of chicks that is fucking nasty. She don't take care of her nails are nails dirty nails probably smells like fucking balls or something like dookie. Nasty is hell. All right, man, and this brings to my next one over ten doesn't take care of a clean house dirty car. And to me honestly, that's a reflection how she see herself dirty nasty. But that's what somebody will get up in them guts and fuck her. That is fucking disgusting. fucking nasty, man Yes, nasty is fuck man. For real. number 11 poor relationship with mother or father in my opinion guys to me. Especially with the father man daddy issues bro. She's going to have a hard fucking time being submissive. She's going to have a hard time respecting masculinity. She's going to be in her masculine. She's gonna be the one that's like to be dominant and it be honest those type of women need to get broke the fuck down. The type of women you gotta really put in a place. That's facts. That's facts. You got to put some type of women in their fucking place. That they will daddy issues man. Damn the type of women do who blame the world for everything bro? Because they have a dad. Stay the fuck away cuz that's that narcissist shit. She blamed the problem on somebody else instead of blaming the problem on herself when she fucked up. It ain't her dad. It's her being fucked up. It's her not seeking help. Stay away from them type of women. I mean you could deal with them, but just be very cautious with them number 12 big titties and big ass if she has these chances if she has these right chances are she been hit on a lot since she was a fucking teenager. Likely to be fucking likely to be bouncing on cock. Okay. Now I'm not going to tell you to stay away from these type of women because I like chicks with big titties and big asses, huh? I like that shit. Okay fellas, I like that shit, but be aware of him number 13. Drug users. We already know about these fucking like hippie down the earth. I smoke weed. I smoke pot. Yeah, that's my parents will crack stay the fuck away from these type of women. Because these women would do anything for some drugs. Facts stay the fuck away from them women, okay? Number 14 is a good one if she's been raped. that means she's always seeking to comfort or she may always wants rough sex. This is something that guys don't want to really hear about their woman. Now, this is something I was saying. I cannot tell you to stay away from this type of woman because majority of the woman in a society have gotten it got their advantage getting taken care of if you know what I mean by that a man has taken advantage of them.

Because guys are sims what does it mean a stamp? Is it guy who compromises his manhood and just for some mediocre pussy. He's a nice guy why she entitled because that's the way she been brought up. She has been brought up and entitlement. She deserves the world. She deserves a good man when she brings nothing. He deserves this she deserves that but she does nothing to deserve it. I thought this was equal. No equality. There's no such thing as equality in today's society. She's better than us. She's better than us. She can do what she wants because she is entitled. She can cheat other when they can help her cheat other women can help her pick out of dick and fuck on you and guess what when she gets caught when you find out guess whose fault it is, it's your fault.

But if you cheat you're the bad guy If U DM a girl you are a screenshot away from getting caught if you even diiemma girl girl would With screenshot isn't it to your wife that same girl with up your wife cheated on you and laugh at you.

And she will keep the beta orbiters around. Ooh, baby you so said to your TV so big ooh, baby. I want to fuck you. She will keep those guys around with his she's married or in a committed relationship. What so wait do you think that when she's always telling you why these guys just keep on the enemy you think she's blocking them? Oh, no, she needs him. So you guys get into it. She gets ego boost. You're never the only one. In fact, she's never yours is just your turn. Enjoy your turn to the best of your abilities. my brother that is why she has male friends. She will not get rid of her male friends because her male friends maybe have fucked her maybe have feel made her feel a certain way. Her male friends are her emotional tampons sponge, but the baited me Orbiter thinks that one day he will fuck because she gives him hope that one day he will fuck. Number 20 take selfies all the time always seeking validation. Well, I just described that in nineteen. She needs validation. In fact if her husband is the only one validating her she will feel some type of way. Meaning that if she upload a picture where the titties in her ass out and she's not advertising or selling any products and it's just our husband like in the picture she would delete the picture because she doesn't just need to she needs all of our validation to feel good about herself. That is the females brain. That is the females brain. That is the females man, if that she will post a picture of her cleavage to keep herself on the market while still being married in a committed relationship because he's never yours. It's just your time. Number 21 last but not least fellas. She wears provocative underwear all of the time like Victoria's Secret. Why because she wants to bounce on some cock at work at school or at home. She wants to pull down her panties and bounce off some cock because her pussy is always dripping. I added a bonus one number 22. She said she celibate she's not celebrate. These women can't even die it for four weeks. They can't even stay on a clean diet for four weeks.

I'm one of your hosts Brandon's joined as always by Jesse. Hello, Jessie. How you doing today? I'm good. How are you? Yeah, I'm good. I am living it up with an adopted living the dream and making a podcast with your bod. Yeah, that is the best but shout out to best friends. Oh, yeah. Anyway, CIP pass and informed insight into all the news you didn't ask for we cannot look at Entertainment News anything interesting. Mainly this first podcast going to be a lot about music because we both love music who doesn't like music. If you don't love music you can get out of my podcast. Yes, pretty much. It's a good thing. There's only two of us in this tiny room with a little mixer. It's not that tiny of a room, but it's pretty big what are sitting pretty close together because you know, do we just tuberose and we are okay being close to each other because that's okay, you know. It can be friends and close to each other and it's not a problem. Also, a headphone chords really restricted fund called the really short so we're gonna cuddle up with her, right? Hmm. So let's jump into our first bit of news for today a rapper flexes about his money and credit card fraud and gets arrested for it. Brendan the goes pretty much I saw this just scrolling through Facebook the other there had a bit of a laugh because these rappers are all about flex and what they go up. This guy's name self-made cash with a K mind you You like the Kardashians? Yeah, except the Kardashians don't get arrested for credit card fraud. No, they just make sex tapes and make millions. Hmm. That's the way to go guys. That's a dream has yeah, so he bragged about committing credit card board in all of this tracks and then he got arrested by the police for it his 25 year old guy real name Jonathan Woods, he's always got hit with a number of charges actually wire fraud aggravated identity theft what's aggravated identity theft. Um, I don't know but I feel like it's pretty Right forward like he took someone's identity forcefully like he was aggravated. He was angry, you know angry took it because like identity theft like usually it's just people don't identity theft isn't a joke Jim. Is that a reference to something office reference because I can catch office. Yeah, you you need a listen. No, you know watch the office the office is a quality shot. And if you don't watch it, you're missing out anyone listening to this go and watch the office if you haven't already quality. Show the US version not the UK. Sorry we could do it is super. Oh, you can't beat Steve Carell it Corral is a dream. Yeah. I've actually had to listen to his music before we start this podcast. Just get an idea of what kind of Artists were dealing with here. If we can call on that you can call him an honest. I think you can call anyone at all. This doesn't mean they're like doesn't mean that Arts quality is my God. They may call it doesn't excuse it was all right, like it's just kind of like a standard Urban beats. Not the best voice not the best lyrics it's lyrics is what got him bad actually. Yeah, because what do we have a quote? We have what he said or is it just a general if he was like, I cannot look he said I got them. My feelings of these swaps. I made a Killin I made 10 and have to split it and then he's got a bunch your Instagram posts of all his money bunch of credit cards got like a fake gold credit card chain, and here it says Woods claim to be sophisticated at credit card fraud when in fact his not this is a federal prosecutors statement released only days ago. Yeah, so he was frequently posting stuff on Twitter and Instagram containing large amounts of money his credit cards and he was he's pretty much trying to promote credit card for which is I think it's like a death wish to be honest. Yeah, if you're gonna promote something illegal just in general don't do the thing. Oh, I mean, I mean, okay do the thing don't promote the thing first up don't it? Legal things are bad. They're illegal for a reason. Don't break the law. But if you're going to do something bad Don't promote it and if you promote something as a meme don't then do it is asking for trouble. I feel so he could have like this could have been is like stick his giving you could have had like YouTube videos with him like fake gold credit card just like flipping them in the air and whatnot. But to actually that going to try and do this and then call out about it. That's like the bubbled it's a bold move. This feels like a world star hiphop kind of move. Yeah. This is definitely a world star feeling like it's almost not real. Yo shout-out to was solve for having some of the Funniest artists in the rap game. That is well start man, you know like day long neck and wide neck. Yeah that that's like the power of memes. They assigned was I have of em, I've got at least two maybe three songs out that that pretty Kickin that's crazy though because widen it got arrested and his mug shot went viral because he had a really wide neck and then they were like, oh this kid has a really long neck or whatever and then somehow they hooked. Been like they met each other that's on to Worldstar. Yeah, he's not still prosecuted though, because I saw a video of the underworld egg. Yeah massive it was recognized. Did you participate? I don't think I did I did I like the egg on part of world history. I don't think I like the message of the egg will get to that in a sec. But they had through a massive party for the world egg like all the FaZe Clan was there for some reason and so it was daddy long and winding they were both at the like celebrating Egg party. It's me agree to just call them long like and widening. That Daddy pot makes me so uncomfortable that he should make you uncomfortable. He gets his neck licked all the time. That's like his thing. What hang on what have you not seen the no explain this to me. What did he want in like the video then like wrapping and stuff and he's there. He's like, I'm pretty sure he says like the like the lyrics like lick my long neck and like there's a video of like girl licking his long neck and wide neck just there in the background like chilling this so much worse. That wide next is watching him. You just show this kind of like that. He's just like his bodyguard lion. Names daddy wide neck like a and daddy long. No. No, I was Daddy's long neck and wide neck or I'm pretty sure it's just daddy long night. And then why neck and I want ice is what Nick? Yeah, as far as I'm concerned in terms of the boys the boys the next. Yeah, it's Daddy Long Neck and wide neck and their songs are next up next up. Oh my god. Let's go out with me. And then the other one is next big thing. Okay, so they're just they're still a meme. They're not there. I just playing into the meme no, eight point eight million views and 4.4 million views. No way. They have 8 million views almost 9:00 last night. The thumbnail is literally a girl looking this kids long neck that that's like crazy the amount of things people get famous famous off because this self-made cash the fraud credit card for guy had about like 2,000 likes Max on Instagram and now he's famous because he did the dumb and then you got is that the thing is he gone? Like if he doesn't get prosecutor if he does and he goes to jail with her if he gets released you see then gonna blow up. Is he going to become big or well some good primer for you? Because like is it? Is it all a strategy did he do it on purpose? So he was like, you know what I'm gonna do all this stuff and then it gets him that meteor exposure. No publicity is bad publicity. It's yeah, I feel so with rap music, especially it's all about the promotion the publicity. These wild wild things that you have to do to try and like getting the name out there because music is very very saturated industry and there's a lot of music out there anyone can be a musician anyone can be a musician proof proof of concept. We've got three interesting Rapids here. You got YouTubers doing a lot of music now that branching out some YouTubers have some solid music. What time do you leave joke songs and stuff, but there are some Youtubers with legit songs out there that are good and a good albums and stuff like Jody respect joji blew up mad the um, what was it? He was like the pink guy. Yeah, I think I Is it filthy Frank wrote the Frank? Yeah, Frank filthy Frank wanted like the greatest internet memes of like the early 2000s now blowing up in that chat stew filthy Frank just for giving us main formats just that are never going to get old now making like you my music but like mature you my music. Yeah, like he did his thing you do the YouTube thing. It was like, yeah like this. Alright and then he beat everyone to do something else and you want to did it and he was successful at it. I think I think that's a common Trend. I would like emo and punk musicians kind of like growing with the times. Yeah, you got it because I think everyone has to mature and if you can grow with stuff and keep going then that's like the dream, you know, yeah for sure you also you go like think about like beds like Fall Out Boy and pack of this car massive massive bands both in their own rights, they kind of started with that emo that punk music the good stuff and then as they kind of got on as Their audience grow old because back in the day Their audience was like man, like fourteen-year-old 6-14 tyke 16 year olds like that the peak age range. And now they're kind of like massive like pop rock frontrunners both in the iron, right? So, I think that's kind of that's quite a while like pumpkiny my music at the moment very I'm not going to say dead. There's I don't think any music genres. I'm going to die fully but it's very small. It's kind of like in it's like baby stages again. Yeah, everything works a little Wayne's so like that was like the early 2000 stuff like BMO, I think everyone was email is cool. Like everyone wants look into that Panic at the Disco came out and they were Mo gone back to like Blink-182 and stuff like massive scene and it's just progressed into other stuff and now like Mumble rap and that's really popular. I think it's like my Britney Mary rappers like the new the new big thing for like the younger generation like again that audience is kind of like the like the late teens juice world with his new album recently came out. A couple days ago again. He's like one of the frontrunners for that kind of music. Yeah. I think that like the way music's always changing and what's popular is popular for a bit and then it's not I'd like to see like where that goes. I'm excited to see what the next big thing is whether that's soon or in like years time. What's a prediction? What do you reckon? What are you thinking? I don't know. I'd like to see like something that never has been like super mainstream come back because like pop music's always going to be pop grunge. Ever going away but see grunge was like in the 90s and stuff like Nirvana grunge had it time 20 year cycle. What do you reckon? I reckon it could come back. No, I see I'd like to see light jazz like come into the maze just out of them know we're never going to come back as much as I love jazz music and much as I love like that kind of like 60s 50s like 40s, even Vibe. It's it's it's had its time but people come in would jumping back into the Roaring 20s next year man. No Roaring Twenties. Yes, but like let's bring it back. Let's bring back swing music dude, electro-swing very very Niche music scene. Still kicking would like to see a niche seen blow up. I think that it'd just be nice electricity. Let's let's get electro swing into the Forefront of the 21st century going to be honest. I don't know what electro-swing sounds like, so I'm not going to advocate for that. It's like it's like swing music and just shocked a bunch of techno over-the-top Jesse that's feels like it ruined both of them. I mean, it's a very niche market. Of course. It's yeah, never never gonna be something like as why does encompassing as pop music is that's fair. You know, what else I think pop music is the reason why it's so heavily driven is singles singles is the currency on our radio at the moment because you can't like you got to release a lot of singles to do stuff. If you just release an album you like boom here it is that's a lot of stuff and like people are going to be sending all of it and you spread Yourself out if you release a single people going to listen first, the only new song you've got at that's all people can listen to you. That's what get to play with music long form content is really kind of not so important. It's not as desirable. Yeah back at you can do it, but you need to lead up with the singles and then the the dedicated fans are the ones that are actually going to be listening to an album or something. We had like classical music back in the old days. So long really long songs. Yeah, but but that was the only time people could listen to music. People would pay to go and sit in a concert hall for two hours and listen to this like one song because I was all the music they ever got so it was like this big exciting thing. Like I actually get to listen to music. Wow, imagine that so now the radio a back. Hey guys for the next two hours. I'm just going to just playing Justin Bieber's new song symphony symphony. Orchestra number 11. Yeah Symphony Orchestra Symphony get that timpani Symphony, but see that's the thing like attention spans have gone way down. Like everyone was paying attention to stuff anymore. It's - fault Not Vines fall don't bring Vine into this. Okay, seven seconds. I format it's ruined ruined everything. It would bind change the comedy theme and it's like quick stuff and that wasn't a bad thing. But it Nest on wasn't necessarily a good thing. But like if music was that long still if you still made a two hours, so that's a lot like if you are listening to an album and you it's a two-hour album, which is like crazy, but if it was and you want to listen to it all you could but if you only want to listen to 20 minutes, Listen to a few songs and then stop like that. It's gives you Freedom, you know, hmm off the top of my head. I can think of only maybe one to album and that's like a deluxe compilation which has like a second CD. So again, it's like two separate albums combined into one. Yeah, so it's a lot that said though. When how do you listen job? Do you like do full start to finish? I have to listen to it an order. It was written or your Shuffle kind of guy. I think I think when a new album comes out if it You see like your first time he first few times. It's earning. You should our I think that you should listen to it in the order that they've given it out in because they have got reasons. They put it in that order whether it tells a story or like this two songs that are connected and they like flow into each other whatever it is. I think that they put thought into the order that they put it in and that at least the first time while you're discovering the songs you should do that because like there's reasons. It's an emotional ride. They take you through how they've Want you to listen to the album and that gives you like the authentic like real experience of that contained album. I think you should listen to it at least once in order don't have to be all together. You can do it over like a few days or whatever, but you should listen to it in order to really get that experience. Yeah. It's been a while since I've kind of just like sat down with an album start to finish just soaked it up in all its Glory. I just like 50 minutes just finding a time where I'm just doing nothing for 50 minutes or even seemed down doing one thing 50. Yeah, very rare that said when I used to listen to albums when they released I would always yeah, I would go to the start to finish like do like this this and this when I first got into music probably when I was like a fair bit young like 14, I didn't really care but I'm order. Hmm. I'd also skip introductions and interludes. I used to hate them just like the idea of like a minute of just like instrumentals was disgusting to me. Well if you were like a really light music Boomer like any met for sure how old were we met Like 11:11 and you didn't get like into music until we were like 14 or so. It was even later than that. It was probably. 15 only 16. So that's lucky attend you 11 when you really kicked in. So like it really lightly bloomed into it. So you kind of went through all the phases of what people do when they're younger like really quick where you didn't just want there was a very like very Progressive it was kind of started with like just pop music on the radio and like they're this cool. But like what else is out there got into rock as like cool. This is this is where like the real the real musics at any kind of evolved through that. It's like you very quickly evolved like you went and he was a slip. Bracelet venue head and you just went crazy and just went through like rock to punk to emo to scream own to metal to alt metal and then all the way back up and now I'm kind of like I try to keep current on everything. I'll just keep up with what's popular and still listen to my favorite bands, but I also like to keep an ear out was what's kicking on the radio. What kind of good albums are coming out Spotify helps alot of Facebook Spotify is like a recommended stuff like if you finish a playlist and they're just put someone at think she'll like yeah, that's some good stuff. Cool, and also they are like the discovery playlist in that for like new music. Yeah, and also the new music Friday. It's like my favorite thing getting up on like a Friday morning the new Spotify playlist for like the week is out as good that's just like new content right there just to like sit down and enjoy that said hasn't I don't think this year. There's been too many full albums that have been like excited for it's pretty early still like it's only March so like there's time to go. But yeah, I don't think there's been at least two stop that. We would listen to 2018 2018 was a big year for busy year for music in general. Let alone like our little bits that we listened to ya even like. We'll talk about later with like the biggest songs of 2018. But yeah, 2018. What a year for me is a severe the music. Yeah, it's if you kind of have that you kind of have like your pinky and your quiet years before that probably like the last PQ is like 2050. I'm going to say yeah, I don't know man because like stuff and it all Blends together. Well, you have like lots of like singles and songs that come at you like. Oh, yeah, this is cool. You got like a banger like song but like that like like she was just there was just hit after hit people were blowing up. We were getting new music old music a lot Yak. Like that was crazy big concert tours as well massive concert tours people would like coming together and not just turning on their own touring with other people that are like equally big also the final year of walk tool which doesn't really affect us here in Australia. Yeah, that said that is there was like the last ever like big full cross-country warped or that's that's like the end of an era and I'm gonna end up because that was like that was more of like the emo type like so the emo the rattle a little punk bands like less than like it wasn't the big pop stuff. It was more of those Niche like less people but still so like massive huge thing that big Festival so many big names going and like last year. That were gone. And now Bang there now what they've done. I think it's the 25th anniversary what they do. They no longer have the full cross country. They just have three shows and I don't know what states exactly. Yeah, they've got three little shows still good lineup still interesting lineups that at the moment you've got like in Australia, the only ones still kind of guys, I'd say download download music festival currently going on at the moment in Melbourne. It was on and Sydney couple days ago as well. Use those Whales big news actually even though it's covered. We see our New South Wales then knew what do you call it, like legislations about music festivals. Yeah, all the war on music festivals going to be ridiculous. Hmm. Well, it's because New South Wales refuses to implement pill testing. Yeah. It's the Crackdown on drugs and like we're not that's not going to political or anything but it is it's getting a bit ridiculous like like all because like this all these festivals and that people doing nothing wrong getting like pulled over and patted. Down or kicked out of somewhere like for no reason. It also makes it hard for the music festival like the people who run it because there's now like extra fees involved in getting a music festival especially in New South Wales. Yeah. It's like you can't afford I've got so much that they can like give to make their festival and if you're upping their fees and stuff, maybe they can't afford to do that now or they're gonna have to do a small Festival who knows like they're getting rid of stuff and impacting this that scene in such a major way. Probably probably the biggest music. Swirl around where we are North Queensland is groovin the moo coming very soon actually in a couple months two months time. I think yeah, well little under two months now the on two months this year's lineup looking very interesting after what was quite for like a music fan quite a bit of a disappointing lineup last year Heard lots of complaints about it. I mean not that you lucky, you know, being driven motor have you no no, I was always keep a lookout on those as lineup. So because when you could hear it from your house, yeah. Yeah close by. But not actually there but this year's lineup very interesting probably the one a lot of people most excited for a billy eilish. Yeah big pretty big name to be coming to like a relatively small place. Well, you got to think that's a like Twenty One Pilots as well when they won't Pilots right as they were blowing up came to groove in the groove in the moon then after that they just skyrocketed, which is a bummer because like this like really good they put on a good show. So like if A little small, like maybe they would come back but like there's no way they're do anything like this now. Yeah, that's why you're gonna have like appreciation like smaller bands and smaller artists because when they come and do these festivals, it's like their chance like make a name and get big and really you can appreciate that's like we're like the most passionate artists. Are you see like the smaller performances in like there's a really intimate one. So yeah really gets you it's the people that are going to give their all no matter what like if you if they're doing a performance in front of a small crowd. Like 200 or if they sell at a stadium with like a hundred thousand if they put on the same show with the same energy. Like that's a good artist. Like if you're going to commit if they commit that much and give it their all that's who deserves to be. Yeah. I think the big be interesting as well looking at like the liner you got a name like Coolio very big artist in the 90s with a very famous song Gangster's Paradise. I'd be interested to see how many people Like what else you can give to the crowds because it's going to obviously play gangsters pound not play like your biggest hit. Yeah, so it's going to play that and I'd be interested to see how well he can retain like, yeah attention. Is he gonna hold a crowd or he's gonna play that song and then people are going to leave. Mmm and then see like little bands like trophy eyes pretty small band blowing up there. They're one of my favorites from I think Perth are from Western Australia really cool like Little Rock Band go check them out that a new album last year 2018 the year of joy. The 18 millimeter thick they had a great album Marshall in it. Yeah, I think I think that makes talking of 2018. I think we should have that of look we've got a list here. I saw this on Instagram the other day. I was just scrolling and I saw that they finally released all the information about music sales. So we'll have a look. So this is from the ifpi or the International Federation of the phonographic industry. And what do they do Brendon? What does that mean? I'm not too sure. Well socially could they have the they have all the stats all the data we need they essentially what they did is. They took all the data from digital downloads sales streams and they compiled into one infographic. So essentially say, what were the best-selling songs of the Year. Number 10. We have good old post. See post Malone - Malone killing the game post Malone Maya. My recent look alike. According to many people. He he blew up from I'm like YouTube as well. Like he was I mean when he started that he's had some like weird stuff when he was younger, but he's a really talented guy like some people are discarded him in that like because of the type of music he makes and also like his appearances. Yeah for like like he wants yeah parents like like the sort of scraggly hair and the face tattoos, like he doesn't necessarily have very aggressive face tattoos as well and have the family friendly image, but he liked everything you see with him. He seems like a really nice to I super down-to-earth has a Good voice too like to hear him sing like he can sing. Wow, you got that right? You can play guitar as well his acoustic guitar skills. A man is a talented dude. So that's why he got the number 10 spot with his song psycho alongside. Also a dollar sign can't forget 9.2 million. That's pretty crazy. Pretty crazy. That's is that just like download streams. What's that? So that's aggregate sales. So across downloads across streams across like digital downloads as well. How many platforms are they do dinner? So it's like the major ones Apple music Spotify. Fi I think they did. I think they did all of it. Like just Everything Everything is Everything. Well, so like Spotify Google play Apple like physical sales explains why it took so long. Yeah. That's why we're only getting it now in March March 6. It came out in 2019. Come along to number nine. We have marshmallow nandamuri that song friends. It's pretty pretty decent song. I remember and a year wrap up like on like MTV and that like I remember being in there. Yeah throughout the year. I can't remember. Hearing it much on the radio or hearing much of it at all though. Honestly saying the name of that song like I'm not like a huge like pop music tight. Like I don't listen to this early songs on the radio all the time. So like the song start jumping out, but I'm sure if I heard it, I don't know what it is, probably. Yeah, it's one of those songs. You kind of just going to what it is me here like, oh, that's right. You really? Oh my that's cool, especially with marshmallow on a memory to very big names in pop in big names coming together marshmallow. Who is he is he one guy? Is he He is the one guy his the is he a lot of guys the one with the giant like white? Yeah, but my head but how do you know it's the same guy on there all the time. I bet you he has like a body double for like the hot festivals and concerts. You must do it be like it could be a whole team people is mobile and they just all share like the mantle like, you know, because yeah, it's hard to tell because now it's cool to be such a big name but also knows who you are. It's like Daft Punk. Daft Punk Daft Punk the he's the new DA Fung putting helmets on kind of yeah and like see a like no one really knows like identity so I can take a walk down the street you could walk past them. We could have a conversation with them and have no idea. That's why you shouldn't do all this thing's we should just leave it for mystery leave it for ya. Don't look it up. Like they don't want it. Don't reduce our eyes. Just let it go man. Number eight Chainsmokers and Coldplay Chainsmokers opinions on them. They became they were black a thing and then they were thing in the neck. I mean almost 2017 was quite sir. Probably. I don't know because that sounds right closer with like the song that blew them that was there a time. That was that big one Andrew Taggart the lead singer of chainsmokers. I think it is. He also he does right most of the vocals and I think he does a lot of that Tech stuff very hated amongst like the singing Community. He's a bad boy. It is not a bad voice. It's just he's not the most loved ya just believe he's a bit flat. I mean, I think the thing with Chainsmokers is like their songs. They've got a stick their songs and they all kind of sound the same. Yeah, like I know that's that's coming from someone that doesn't like listen to them. So if anyone's had big Chainsmokers fans, we're sorry. We don't need to offend you are not trying to like talk smack on them giving our opinions. Just kidding. I don't know. We're not supposed to give our opinions, but they have good music. I do like like the audio All of chainsmokers, it's very like they got some good stuff and I teamed up with Coldplay on something just like this like ten million fireflies a big band that definitely not as big as they used to be but that's a huge name. Yeah, and ten million dollars in sales is nothing to laugh at that's crazy. Right? That's wild. Now number seven number seven is one might surprise you because I was going through the list and I heard of all the songs except number seven be a part by tra who the hell is tra. That's what I thought so I did a bit of research. Research voiced out of this. She is a Chinese singer and it was a pretty sure it was a theme song for a TV show or a movie. Also. It's not even like just a song like it was for something it was she did it like there's like a music video for the song. Yeah. It's just like a regular music video, but I also saw like a couple results pulling up like a movie so I can come in like, you know how they write a song and then we even if they are yeah, they take it up. Yeah, which is really impressive to think that number seven ten point nine million sales to One very small. Well not very small. But like in terms of world music usually have like American artists. Yes dominated dominates the scene, especially with pop music just dominates the same sofa number 70 ready to come in to beat people like Chainsmokers post Malone. Marshmallow Coldplay quite impressed. That's a that's a big thing. Like if I hope she's seen this. Hmm, because that's crazy. I listen. It's pretty pretty chill song. It's more of like a ballad kind of song which is good to see interesting. Run, this just says like pop bangers, but the fact that like she should Chinese he said hmm so that I'm assuming a Chinese audience then the song was in Chinese. Yeah, so that exclusively I'd like a song in Chinese which is like I know trying to like a huge play it is but compared to the entire rest of the world that they themselves would have the majority of the sales have managed to get ten point nine million and put this on a list like that's at number seven to that's She's killing it speaking of big hits big hits boy despedido. That's besito what Luis fonsi and Daddy Yankee that's macedo was destroyed by the internet like yeah, that's me. See those a good song man. But yeah it definitely thought. Oh, I remember hearing I was this the Justin Bieber version or the AG says Louis Fonzie and Daddy Yankee, so I think this was the original because I think the original did have more hits the original is better because it's all in Spanish. Hmm. Yeah, because I remember hearing the first song is like the Spanish songs took me back to the Gabriel Iglesias tears and classic. Yeah, it's it's good to see that kind of music making a bit of return. Maybe that's the breakout genre that 2020 will come along Spanish Latino music coming back get the Latino and it's in it. That'd be amazing. Good song though. I was it is a it's a good song. It's bit of a banging me. Killed it like you can't listen to the song and just be like, okay, this is like this is a good song. I enjoy this song now you'd listen to it and you're like, ah, I've heard in that one video or like it's online. So this is so sad. Yeah like so this is we should get an Alexa for the book. We should just so we can played Esposito. I'm repeating. Yeah coffee strike so hard copy. We don't want copyright. No one reward us for copyright. Yes speaking of memes and getting destroyed by the f-stop segueing into ship Pro game destroyed by the internet Maroon 5. I've written five killed their own career at the Super Bowl. Did you end up watching that performance? I didn't get I can get through it. I think I was over it was like twelve twelve maybe is 18 minutes. It is anywhere in the span of like 10 to 20 minutes and look ice Love Maroon 5. I still love like the musical Community, but that yeah, I kind of think that past that you have good days and bad days and they just very unfortunately for them. Had a pretty bad. A hmm on one of the biggest events of the year the most televised American supervise a hard to get right though. Like you look back on the history of Super Bowls. Yeah, but like some people kill the Super Bowl. I do Lady Gaga coming down on like ropes flying in like that killing the Super Bowl and Super Bowl is is very hit-or-miss it is I guess they sometimes Miss huh? Yeah they do and it's a shame because it's like for some it's mainly the big bands they get to play it so So yeah, you you have to would be cool. It's never going to happen. But I got small or I can get like a breakthrough out us getting like playing the Super Bowl. That's life's changing. Yeah, I would be cool to see so yeah, the song goes like you eleven point nine million sales. That's the version with cardi B with Kobe and well the sound effect Master herself. Cardi B, which my sound board with just an eb-5. Yeah. Yeah. And what do you what are your thoughts on cardi B? Why don't you there at should give us a bit annoying. It sounds like she's a bit much. She's a lot, but I think she she really Shines on those features like with Bruno Mars. Yeah in like Maroon 5 and my God, DJs and that good good like thing. She's got her own stall like in the rapping and stuff questionable choices. She makes some time. So I'm punches and Nicki Minaj that one of the biggest that's how you get publicity is all what we talk about more rap music. It's all about About the global bad publicity. That's where you gotta go. But yeah, I think she's alright like she got some good stuff and she's actually gonna be funny like she goes. Oh, yeah. She's pretty entertaining. She's an entertainment ethical. Yeah, and whether it's an act to like maybe she's not always like that but she knows is cameras on a she's like I'm gonna throw my shoe you have someone sometimes with music industry is very hard to tell. Yeah. It's like what's legit was like, yeah and the privacy of your own home when she's with her kid it she just like a normal Mom. Oh, she's like walking on a kid like it's dinner time. Oh, could you imagine she did a great add the Pepsi at the Steve Carell Pepsi? Did you see that? Yeah, that was a great one of the beautiful things of the super. He's been pulling out some bangers with the pestle General with the Pepsi. I'm going to solve the riots with a Pepsi. Yeah. Look the Super Bowl as you can't go past them for like the people are already content that great the amount of money that people put into this of all my clothes my mind. It's be more than the sales of these songs to think about it. Yeah. All right. Now we can talk about number four without talking about number three. So the three and four spot held by one man, the ginger leader himself Ed Sheeran. Yeah, the man the myth the legend what a talented dude to have two songs on the top selling list. That's crazy beating out all the big names. Is that a restoration look like I've done this before that insane and top songs forms. I know that Khalid. He held the number-one and number-two spot for songs at the same time, which is only been done by a copy of I think action did that with these two, so yes with perfect and shape of you and Drake also did it. I'll maybe Castle on the hill but like yeah like yeah something many people have done. It's like Max like five people that's crazy Ed Sheeran's like one of those dudes that you look at him until he's just like he's a normal-looking guy. He's just all right is like the average guy and then he's like crazy talented. Yeah, and that's for sure. Sure. Yeah, like you listen to his songs like he hasn't had an easy life or anything, but he's made himself what he is and he's still very down-to-earth and like it's crazy what he can do. Like I went to his concert last year would have been almost a year ago by now, I think and he liked it. He goes up on stage and you got a concert and it's these bands and like all these people with the production and stuff. Yeah Ed Sheeran goes I was saved and it is just him and a guitar and a loop pedal. So you need But this sounds he makes with that is insane because it he fills the whole stadium with just his voice and his guitar and like it's insane. How much happens like you like? Wow, this is just you forget. It's just one guy you think there's like 10 of them up there? Yes, that's why well-deserving perfect number for 13.5 million in sales. And the number three Shep view fourteen point nine million. No, do you still accept who you are? Is it over player down. Did you ever like Shepherd? I would say I prefer. Now that faith is a good time. Just the original one. You still need you like a bunch of versions of that. He did it with Beyonce as well. I'd say and he did that like classical Andre. Yeah, so he did a couple versions. I'd like the original version of perfect. Just the guitar to like nice song lesser shape of you good song. It kinda is just like a Bop though. It's about they did it a lot. Yeah. It's kind of like you've listened to a couple times like cool. I've heard whatever you need to hear from this song. Yeah, and now good day is because we love that Sharon. Hmm. Number two Drake. What a legend in the rap modern rap scene coming in. Number two spot God's plan fifteen point three million dollars in sales. Yeah, but Jake like Jake was he was a just a guy it was a guy named Gracie changed so much you look at pictures of him and he was like this skinny little dude and he got dick he um, he's buff dude. He um, did I Watch the video the other day of like him. He was like 10 years old with his like Dad or on course like a relative or like a friend to someone and he was just doing like some freestyle rap and it was pretty cool. Like he's come a long way and he's really funny as well. Like he's done a bunch of stuff on SNL. I just love that content. But yeah, what do you guys plan? It was really big song while she probably one of the biggest songs in like the iron ball wrapped in a frenzy. I'm a kind of said that I listened to it a heat. But yeah, like it wasn't about song it did got memed as well. It's hard to be so big and not get me into this point. I think it's all the song in my feelings. The Kiki song as is so affectionately say the Kiki song. That's yeah people jumping out of cars that was put themselves in danger. It's gone a bit far the Astros. That's what comes along. It's all part of God's plan. It's all God, please and then that brings us to the number one spot. Can I get a drum roll, please so you can Alright, so number one spot Havana Munna Bhai Camila Cabello featuring Young Thug. Yo, this song is very polarizing you ask people about this song and they love it or they hate it with a passion when I when I saw the shot number one, I saw Havana. I was like did that come out in 2018 thought it was like a 20-17 song. I mean if it's under this is the number one song of 2018. It's probably 18 song probably okay teams just feels like so long ago. That's a good song. It's also what kicked her solo career off. It did branching off from her Fifth Harmony group past and it was good song like I'm not gonna lie. I liked it. I just it's one of those songs like any it had massive song radio mainstream radio very easily can kill a courier what other career but like a song like shape of you was on the radio all the time got killed if I don't honor it was just over played. There's only so many times you can In a her singing that song. Yeah for you get a bit annoyed like the music video as well for our I didn't seem that. What's the use of yeah, it's like it's kind of like a it's very much throwback to like her Cuban Roots. Yeah, but that's carrots and it's kind of like heavy dancing. It's kind of like a bit of like a love a love story in a music video in which is cool. Yeah. The whole thing is a Love Song now I do you have the stats about that being the number one song. So that is the most stream Song Ever by a solo female. All artists which is quite impressive Aid 888 million streams across all providers has now been streamed over 2.6 billion times worldwide yo that insane 3.6. Do you know how many people are alive?

You going to drop it in a day how has anyone can get access that like file that video but it's crazy how like people they act like they gave you a day's notice, but everyone knew the Jonas brothers were coming back like That news just spread like wildfire.

I'm like, this is a good song and everyone like shoots on Frozen because it was so saturated in the media. So little kitchen is a good movie. I think that's a lot of thing with animated like films and TV shows and movies films and movies. The same thing directed at kids is the kids ruin it. Yeah, if you're a parent and you watch Frozen, you're like, oh this is like pretty good me like I enjoy it too and then your kid wants to watch Frozen three times a day every day. And then also like the marketing and straight just like pumping out toys like have an Elsa doll have a whatever the other chicks now on adult. Yeah, figure and Olaf and yeah Olaf was the kid thing is always like a one thing kids like can let merch minions like same concept. I love the minions were like for the kids, you know, they were like you we can sell that to keep people was it too Despicable Me movies and dominions movie and then was there a Despicable Me 3 I feel something makes me think. Yes. Mmm, that's pretty decent. And they held us well for an original series. Oh good it is then they drew like I hate minions now. I'm still waiting for the day. Well, I go 24 hours and I don't see him in Yin. I mean I went yesterday. It doesn't mean you know way. I did don't I was home all day. I'm don't believe wasn't on the internet.

And today we'll be doing a review and preview of QPR and a preview of the Darby gaming midweek. Let's start off with the with the magical game under the lights of the costume Friday night. What were your thoughts Jake? It wasn't good enough from QPR defensively and attacking wise I think we should have put about seven.In jobs is away in the first 20 minutes. Obviously, that's a bit of an exaggeration. But I think that we could have been three and a lot in the first 20 minutes, but we just didn't take our chances and that was what that was what when it for you not yeah, most clinical and yeah, I still think if if you did obviously got a goal in the third minute to get you guys a head if you did and you should of got a second goal even maybe three and if you did go Second goal. I thought there'd be no coming back for Fulham because we're not one of those teams that like we come back from being Studio to Goes Down And even 20 minutes in I was fully confident that keep y'all get the three points. Hmm. Yeah, I think I was confident myself and I'm not like I'm never usually confident and keep you I'm using quite pessimistic, but I genuinely think I genuinely think that we play at the we look like Barcelona for that for that first 20 minutes. I'm not exaggerating. Well, it was inside though playing really well. It was also a bit you have to admit to our defensive issues. I thought Ro dark green like moss it like we do. I know ream hit the post he tries to block it but still I defense was shocking like we looked all over. Yeah. Yeah, he if it wasn't for him towards the end. Definitely and I think there was another he did like a great safe at near the End of the first off I think it was yeah one-on-one. Yeah, there's one on one as well and Nucky well should have should have scored. Yeah should have buried it. Usually he puts him away. No drops of the keeper and rodik. He should I'm very impressed by Road Act and the fuck. He's the only we need to sign up a goalkeeper like Rhoda I've we've been interested in peacock Farrell that you know, yeah, so if we can pick him up, You are even and get maybe one or two new send a half because I think on fullbacks took cocaine and Ryan and I think Ryan Manning's one of the best left packs in the league. Yeah, but I think when it comes to Center back, we've got the worst offense. I think I don't have I don't know if they didn't actually know their fax my heard. Someone say earlier in the comment section that we're the only team in the football league. That hasn't kept up in. Yeah. I saw that you're obviously at the game. I was watching the sky sports that you were like, I think you're the only one that had It had had not kept tickling. Gee, you know that. Yeah in the championship I'm talking about like Premier League champion won a league and I think we might be the only teeth. Well that's keep your for I'm guessing in January. You're gonna get your defensive signings in the window. Hopefully moving on towards the late later in the game. I thought come on at like everyone before the game was like oh God he's coming in for make sure that she's gonna he's probably gonna mess it up for us like the attachment going to score any goals, but he proved all of us wrong and he held up. He like he he's putting the pressure on Mitch which now for midweek because he like, it's really it's really hard when you got two good Strikers. And like they obviously knew play a formation that doesn't include yeah and like nature which is the obvious first choice, but now come on is coming in Via Ela and here but the thing is he hasn't scored since January. So yeah this could you never know this could be is a is like the start of his comeback since that penalty situation with Mitchell Mitchell. It's all gone downhill. Yeah, that's true but camera but like that's not who button the negatives and being right now. He sees me but he was fuck. Yeah, he's really good for the night. I thought obviously he got and he stopped options we gave you that second. Yeah, but he's stuck at away quite like it was kind of he kind of Hit the goal in it went into the bottom corner, but for the second goal, but second full of gold, but it was a bit like I know your goal. He's a bit like he's a bit for me. He's not the best last season you get 13 clean sheets. He was really good lost it for me. You need to get someone bit more quality. In January, we are genuinely yeah and a peacock feather orgasms. Yeah, as you said and like tomorrow's good knockout was good. As you said or even said in Popeyes. He said personally to me. Did you think he was good? Yeah, I think no cotton. Come on over the main people that just terrible odds on defense. I didn't really think I'm I seen the film fans say to me. I didn't actually numbers on a comment section of Instagram post. He said the essay was quiet, but then I responded with I think Kelly Valero and who did you have a midterm Stefan Johansson or Harrison? Read? Ya know Harrison we'd heard from read. I think Kenny read and causal Arrow really quiet like many wasn't as you just true. You had one song. He had one shot and it just went into Roseate like what cavallaro he tried to end the first half it was one one cavalera should have stuck a chance way hit the post you see waxing at the folks is just do you think cavalera is good enough what? As as your you had a question. I'll mention it now about do you think komara should start the next game and I I genuinely think he should start instead of cavalera and left-wing. I know it's not he's he he is in Number 9 like his it's not as ideal position, but you can't put him in front of me. He's got he's got he's got pace and kemara knock on and make sure it does sound quite quite nice and also caviola is really good when it To time wasting because when we got a call and I'm 90s minute he limped off and he went and gave all the players a hug me every every thought was quite every team does that well? I bet it took about two minutes ago. Yeah, but if you winning one now, I you prop I say we're probably the if I was the referee I would you guys I just I just saw like keep your so annoyed at the end. They're like, oh my gosh you we deserve to win that you probably he's probably do. Yeah. Yeah, I think I think we should play house. His voice now and see what he has to think. Yeah. So how is voicing is coming in now? Okay. Great keep your after 15 minutes from got more into the game, but it was shocking at the start. I don't think full of excelled at off to their full abilities and over the whole game really having 50 of this obsession is boring front of us. We are procession side. That is what we aim for. I thought the QPR shit to us side of it. However, QPR do you have the likes of that world as a cue Gil? I think we did restrict the matter. I'm get the Sao because he worked his magic as he always starts. I think that the shots will give us a call from Fulham and I think that Kimura could be one of our knees strike and so we could put it up probably bitch bitch, but he's poor for full of a storm. You always score a pogo stick. It should have been three little up. Yeah, so I think that's the whole overview on the game, but I think that if Kamara you should give Kimora more game time and that would be great for fun. So come on you want Yeah, I agree with how the about giving come on we'll get in time as we said and we imagine you could be our next number 9 you never know. Yeah, but thankfully but as you said he's got the wing but he's bought pay so he could play on the window, but I don't see him even with Mitch of it's just being I know he scored two goals, but just because Mandzukic scores two goals when Ronaldo's are for your vehicle. It's going to be very unlikely if he's instead of makes you wish but moving on to mid week against Fulham of got Darby QPR have got just again lost in the forest oh yes over two Rivals and we both got this arrivals yeah yeah and I think we're going to lose three one and your home Patrick yeah we are and I think our defense is going to make Louis grabbing look like fry Maradona but I think it could be a really insane game that one because both laugh I'm not sure about National Forest is offense but your defense is shocking no offense and I'm not sure nothing for a second quad best offense not really sure but I think I'll be a lot of goals could um I'm pretty to to actually for keep your Forest really good goalkeeper oh yeah that's true I think for that project critics and she gave me a bit of optimistic so I don't think we can win that I just I love it when there's like We can gain in the midweek games and reaching I just get so excited. Yeah, nice brilliant cause them but it's funny because we've got not on and for some with Bobby who you've gotten so we've got the two rival. Yeah exactly what we planned our be away. So yeah, you'll probably lose that. Yeah, well no. Oh, yeah. Yeah, we can talk about Darby now that they they haven't been okay, they haven't had the ideal source for season, but they they started to improve they beat press someone nil in their latest game and okay, they've started really badly kyo's gone and like a Mason mounts gone to Chelsea and lampard's gone, of course, so they haven't been the most positive at the beginning but Started to get some momentum. Do you agree? Hmm. Yeah, I do. They had really bad start to the season. I remember there were 19 foot one point and they for it back. They have look erased wrong side of his you getting that one nil win over Preston on Preston Preston and the weekend which was a big result for them obviously pressed and being a really like since our candidate for promotion this year. Yeah. So what are your predictions for our film game at the cottage? Oh, so I think for Lamar got what was Daddy I think they're going to draw 2-2 all similar to you and ask I think Martin why corn is going to score twice the Darby and I think Mitch row and Kenny will score for you not AK-47 no more all depends on my free starts. Oh, yes true. But I feel of it. I feel a bit defensive a shake. We're going to I think we can fit this in the bag. Like I think it could be a tuner or to 1/2 the whites because I think we all know they've had a good start being a bit better recently Darby, but I think we still got the quality to go out there and get the three. Yes, but but are you a bit? supported that the force that far having the world's biggest net value of a team that you've got 116 million the most expensive League. Well, like I always say like I think you've heard me say this before we always start playing better towards the end of the season and yeah, but that like for our promotion playoff campaign, like we've got to the Premier League this time last year. We were literally mid-table. Like I mean, there's no point during the playoffs were like mid-table like that playoff season. So yeah, I think we will start to kick in do you do you think we'll get for motive? It's quite a big question. I mean your fourth which isn't bad. Yeah, but there's loads of teams that are like joint with us has been really close to Championship. So three points off like seven, I think so. Yeah when against forest and then be Dhabi we could even fall into yeah, like chicks like you can get like there's a few wins you can go so far like you got the table if results go your way after a couple of games you can be tough, but I think full um, I don't I don't I don't think you're going to get automatic. I think that will be leads and West Brom. I think you'll definitely get to the finals with the playoffs alongside. Let's say Preston. Okay, but what do you win that water? Wait and see but yeah, I think I think you have the ability and the quality to get promoted. This is whether you use that quality. Yeah my QPR like final prediction I'd go for I think you'll get about maybe like tenth or just just above the playoffs if we have a good window we can maybe get sick if we play well. If not, we can maybe get 8 4/10 but yeah, so so that was what's not. Yeah, this is house. This is house view on the Darby preview. I think the doggy game is going to be a wonderful game. I hope I get to go. So Darby 11 from 24 points and full of for 429 post. There is a big difference there. However, Preston who are exceeding amazingly well lost 1 L 2 Darby recently, but Darby did have quite a bad start to the season so they've got lots of threats. Stay this Jade of Bogle. He's got the own goal in the East mist and star be Tom Lawrence who should be in jail. There's the Forest Friends charm. So overall I think that the type of game will be a great game really tough because obviously you played in the playoffs. I think the Fulham can easily win it but it will be time to difficult because the difference in points is only five and the places is 7 so As I obviously want for them to win but it's under lights again and we're doing quite well on for the lights so home. So we've got all the fans behind us. But let me go to restrict those threats and we've got to improve our ability. I hope Kumar starts as well and my match prediction. It's going to be 3 1 to the to the whites. And yeah as I say again, I think we can do really well and if it gets three points that great come on your thoughts. Yeah, that was quite a good point by house saying I'm only five five-point difference but seven places showing how closely Championship can be that shows because if we lose the Derby today and who you got in the weekend, I mean tomorrow Tuesday. Sorry. What do we go? We've got a Swansea on a another Friday night. So there's a whole game. So if you lose both of those and Darby get two wins on the truck against Fulham, and yes, Dobby will be above yeah exactly subjects that shows how good a championship. It is yeah, that's why I love the championship even more than the Premier League. Yeah, no definitely so you love to go up there just for the money. Yeah, of course one last question and I'm just going to see who this is from. This is from the Instagram. So we do questions. Yeah, I made a point is I think the whites the whites Fulham can win easily. I don't think it's going to be easy. I think you'll be a tough game. Yeah. I think though equalize them will get a win but the question is from Harry underscore n c l-- underscore o6. He said if you were films arch-rivals, this is quite a simple question. I I think it's probably the obvious one you'd go forward probably QPR and Chelsea. And yes, it seemed with QP. I'm guessing like yeah, I'm Brent for Frost and millwall. Ooh, and then everyone but yeah, we got Brent for Darius a bit of a cur irrelevant. Yeah full member if it isn't really that that day. Yeah, it's big but it's not massive. Yeah. Yeah. It's not a massive star be okay. So I think that's the end of the podcast. I think that was really interesting forecast will probably be next. Probably me and he'll and will be after Dhabi game before. For the Swansea away, so I'll probably be maybe Thursday or Wednesday and come on you whites and I'll see you guys next time keep your plate full of free now. Oh really you are.","– The NFL's season kicked off last night, with the Minnesota Vikings taking on the San Francisco 49ers in the Super Bowl. It's a big game for both teams, as the 49ers are trying to stay in the NFL's playoffs and the Vikings are trying to avoid being knocked out in the first round for the second year in a row. Here's what you need to know: The New York Times has a profile of the 49ers' Jerry Rice, who is the league's all-time leading scorer with 2,936 goals.

Today's tip comes from Jake Jordan the host of the unlearned show and he's talking about how habits can be anchored with previous habits. If you ever wanted to try something new but just have a hard time staying on track. Well, I learned a tip the years back from a guest who showed me how I could add a new habit to my list every week if I wanted to when they'll be amazing if you could eat.Click add something to your life. It would help improve you well, I'm not going to hold out any longer. The tip is called anchoring and you may have seen it and the show Sherlock Sherlock Holmes has what he calls a mind Palace and he can go through and find pieces of information really just by closing his eyes and remembering things but it's actually far less complex than that. All you have to do is Anchor the new habit to an old habit that you've already got down. Let me give you a quick example. I brush my teeth every day. Day, hopefully you do too, but I wanted to start flossing more often. So I made sure that I had something to Foss with by my toothbrush and I made a commitment to myself that every time I picked up my toothbrush. I would also floss. So guess what? I started flossing more. So why don't you go out and try anchoring a new habit to an old one and make a new one today. Thanks. Jake great tip and thank you for listening to self-improvement daily.","– If you've ever tried to start a new habit and just couldn't keep it up, there's a tip for you. It's called ""anchoring,"" and it works like this: Instead of trying to start a new habit, just stick with the one that's already in place. For example, if you want to start flossing, you should make a commitment to yourself that you'll Floss every time you pick up your toothbrush. And if you want to start brushing your teeth, you should make a commitment to Floss every time you pick up your toothbrush. So, as self-improvement expert Brian Ford explains on his website, ""I made sure that I had something to Foss with by my toothbrush and I made a commitment to myself that every time I picked up my toothbrush. So guess what? I started flossing more.""",0.12422360248447205,0.11180124223602485

I did for a logistics and Freight kind of conference, which is super unique but there was a lot of great kind of trials and tribulation of Entrepreneurship. So this is a unique podcast. We're both Executives on entrepreneurs. I think they're gonna get a ton of value out of this. So hope you enjoy I hope everybody's been well miss you guys and hope you're having a great start to the summer. This is the garyvee audio experience. How you doing? Yeah.You came from the other way, so don't like I said, we don't know what to expect right off the bat. Well, I'm so excited to have you here. We have a mutual friend. We haven't shot a couple mutual friends. So Ted ailing. Yes, it's so I think instead here. I don't know if he's in the audience but interesting enough, that's how I actually first heard about you was through Ted and Ted's like the underground mayor of Chattanooga shootings, but one of the things interesting, is this New York media company that you've built Actually ended up opening at Chattanooga, Tennessee office. Yes, I'd love to hear why why Chattanooga, you know, I think everybody in this room whether professionally personally realizes Serendipity and you know, a lot of different nuances that you never expect come into play. I had a new book come out several years ago that I wanted to promote and my favorite thing about being a marketer and the salesperson is I prefer to be a marketer because then it comes to me. But when I have something I have to accomplish I have to go into sales mode. And so when that book was out I wanted to for it to do well and I created packages where I would trade, you know, an enormous amount of book sales for me showing up somewhere and I get this email from Ted in Chattanooga and he came in heavy and hot and I was thrilled. I mean I'm agnostic about where I go when you have the kpi of the results you go anywhere. I didn't realize there wasn't a direct flight to Chattanooga that was a little bit complicated. But other than that I got there and then what took over is the same reason most of the good things in my life have happened which is within the first eight minutes of being on the ground. I just you know intuitively was like this is an interesting place and it wasn't, you know, a lot of times later on people manipulated to it was the fiber or this and that it was strictly the human beings and just the gut feeling I had navigating through the different businesses and people that I met at the macro level. I'm trying to build a very serious Communications company and my biggest concern in building. It is getting too much in The Silo of New York or LA or London. And so I give a lot of thought about where to open up offices to make sure that you're getting a flavor of all the Brent mindsets and angles and nuances around the world let you know as somebody who you know as career took a big turn when he started investing in Silicon Valley startups what you were just saying on stage that I caught, you know, not only are the costs and competitive landscape of talent different in Silicon Valley and Chattanooga, but the entire ecosystem of how one sees the world and I think one thing everybody in this room can appreciate his perspective is incredibly important and you need different perspectives to achieve big things. And so there was a very macro ambition for me to open offices and places. That weren't like La San Francisco New York and nuga ended up being the first one. We as a Chattanooga native. I certainly appreciate that. It's interesting. I talked to a lot of you know, we sit at the intersection of Silicon Valley with Freight and we're venture-backed as well. So we're in constant dialogue and I can empathize and relate with the founders in the valley. but in many ways I find that even the most successful companies that have raised Venture funds that are in San Francisco often times don't have his deep context about the industry that they're just a ton of success and you can't you have to give them credit for the success, but it's interesting because someone who has deep Market context often times those companies don't and wondering when you look at your outside of New York outside of San Francisco and a lot of freight companies are graphic dispersed of Midwest and Southeast. What do you see that's different about those particular entities than out in the valley. Well in the valley, you know, as many people here know enormous percentage of those companies are started by extremely young people and so they have no context of any of this tree the other thing that many may know in this room, but may not is one of the biggest reasons I've walked away and didn't start a venture capital firm. The back of being an early investor in Facebook and Twitter and Uber. I had all this momentum and some were about seven or eight years ago. I realized how much I didn't enjoy, you know, investing and more importantly investing in companies that weren't actually building companies. They were building Financial Arbitrage machines, you know, most of the companies in Silicon Valley today are built to raise another round of fundraising and then sell to a bigger company or right now because the IPO Market is hot go public. It's all math. It's all Excel sheet. It's all CAC and LTV. It's legitimately not but like I'm not kidding here. And this is it's not a Raz. It's just not what I'm interested in. I'm far more like, you know, I come from a growing up in a liquor store. That was a family business baseball cards. Like I'm a merchant I'ma build a business kind of guy. Yeah. I just it's very awkward to watch. And sit in meetings where everything is about pandering to more Capital not to executing for your customer. So I mean, is it a bubble or is this just a phenomenon? You think it's a bubble? I do and where is the end? Is it who buries IPO if I knew that I'd be quicker to my path of buying the New York Jets. I don't know and and by the way, I could also be disproportionately wrong. Like I I think I'm already wrong. I would have never thought. Thought that we could be here 11 years, you know the way we solved two thousand seven eight nine s economic issue felt like such a bandaid that I thought was going to lead to such horrible Behavior, which it has but I would have never thought that the global economy and the US economy would have been able to sustain 11 years of hyper growth during that kind of bad behavior. Just funding unlimited, you know, look, I think one thing I hope you'll appreciate here for the next 55 minutes. I'm going to stay in my Lean, I'll talk about things. I know and I won't talk about things. I don't know the macro rationale to the global economy is something above my paygrade. It's just not where I spend my time, you know, obviously there's an enormous amount of capital coming in from SoftBank from Saudi Arabia from other places that I think continues to maintain it, but this is the greatest era of fake entrepreneurship ever. Because they're just so much money in it. Right? I mean for everybody in this crowd that's over 40 years old. Like I am myself we didn't grow up in a world thinking that our idea was worth four million dollars. And that is absolutely what the average you know, Highly Educated 21 year old sitting in college thinks she or he thinks that whatever idea they come up with they should go and easily be able to get a million dollars on a four million dollar valuation for the Uber of sneakers, but it's interesting because there have been some successes. And so how do you define you talk about faking entrepreneurship versus real entrepreneurship? How do you how do you know when you look at a deal? How do you know which is which is which you don't? So what so you've made some significant Investments early stage Investments. Yeah, but I've stopped Uber was one of those. Yeah, I mean but I've stopped but I've stopped because in two thousand six seven eight nine ten when I would sit down with an entrepreneur she or he was an entrepreneur because entrepreneurship was coming out of an era where it wasn't on a pedestal right now. Everybody wants to be an entrepreneur because it's legitimately cool, which is just wild for me to think about, you know, like just the way Being a businessman or woman wasn't cool in 1992 and was Bill Gates, you know, like fucking nerd, you know, like so so now that everybody wants to put entrepreneurship in their Instagram profile and that's cool in the club. That is just Bizarro world, but that's also done what sports and wrapping has which is everybody wishes they are and what's different about entrepreneurship Than Rap and sports is When you say you're a rapper someone's like all right wrap and then if you guys suck everyone's like oh you suck. And when you say you're a basketball player people are like at the YMCA or or going to the league, but when somebody now says they're an entrepreneur. It's just accepted and we haven't matured into are you a successful entrepreneur or a wannabe entrepreneur and I, you know to be very Frank I'm concerned about it because I think the one thing I love about Stupid or ship is it's binary either you're going to win or you're going to lose and I think that there's a lot of people right now that are not built with dealing with the emotional baggage that comes along with a public loss. And so I spent a lot of time with young entrepreneurs around the mentality of like when you lose, you know, are you ready to take that ridicule? And what are you going to do? But you don't I think the one you know, one of the ways you can is look in the rare occasion that aisle. Make a investment these days. I like people who've already built a real business. You know that one of the ways you can do it, you know as I've evolved I get way more into the jockey than the horse so much of the money I've lost and investing was the idea was great and I would have run it successfully but I bet on somebody who never run a business before and again so many people here know running a successful business has way more to do with emotional intelligence. Then the ability to know how to make a good decision about a product or service. You can build a great SAS product. You can have all your CAC and LTD properly figured out you can have a lot of things right but as a CEO, if you do not know how to build a comfortable culture that creates retention and you know and many other variables you're going to be vulnerable through actual business long-term. And so I'm very much on the kick now of the Jockey over the horse. Essentially say that because I think about my own life and I think the most significant times in my life and then when I fell and felt in a really sort of public way and just for my own Clarity a macro failure like out of business or a micro failure of them in a business failure, like I'm a crow look out of business. Yeah. Yeah. Well, I for me it was at a business. Yeah, because I think and I apologize for jumping in and please continue, but I think I'm obsessed with micro failures. I'd prefer not the macro failure. Right? Like I always think the business survived I just didn't okay. That's a personal like when you run out of cash. Yeah, they make decisions. But I wonder it's interesting because you think about that and that, you know sort of informs you much better because you sort of have this I think the thing pattern recognition right? It's that you've seen this movie will you sign it? And and for me it was this first time I always sort of been in a having a family that has successful entrepreneurship. You sort of see the What a successful entrepreneur does as you're a kid growing up and you see your dad build business. He went through tough time. And I remember having conversations were times that they were tight on cash and things were not always in the early days. We're not always great but I didn't see that as a kid because I idolized my father and I Look to Him as this sort of God of business and I never understood that he had gone through these that had he had had tougher skin because he had to do it and he had seen his father doing substance. So when I truly sort of fucked it all up when I truly like it was in for me. So first time I ever felt what it was like to completely just be done. Yeah and had felled in a way that people knew and that was humiliating. But what what it taught me was that I could I could I could do it again. I could I could I did that it was painful and it sucked and you never want to go back there. But you also are now, you know, you can survive it you can rebuild and I think that was a much more powerful less than if you just had unlimited success and in some ways in my early 20s, please. Had a platform inside of my dad's business that enabled me to build a very successful business and so I was sort of insulated and I thought well that's what success is because you have this platform. It's easy to build a really successful business when you already have an infrastructure having to do under owns quite different and and that was so the first time I realized it and so it's interesting you say that you look for successful businesses. But I also Imagine the character of the story is also important to you it is but to your point like the path to Success is Not Rate, right and so you're right. You look under the hood, but you said something super important and now I'm just going to be raw for a second because this is going to bleed into parenting as much as it is entrepreneurship, you know, the greatest thing that happened to you was getting punched in the mouth the greatest reason, I believe that we're living through such fake entrepreneurship right now is not only is there an enormous amount of capital in play for these 20 to 25 year olds, but they're the generation, you know that was parented in a way that tried to Eliminate losses from the ecosystem. I mean this is the generation of eighth place trophies, right? This is you know, my favorite thing that's going on in society right now is 45 to 60 year olds, you know clowning on Millennials and making fun of them and I keep looking at them and I keep reminding them that you parented these kids. Everybody gets a trophy, right? Yeah, I mean and so, you know, we've demonized to these kids losing I love losing. Like micro losing especially more than macro losing is incredibly motivating. You know, I mean, there's nothing more fun than losing regular-season games, you know, you learn from them, you know, come the playoffs you'd like to build on that. But yeah, I mean II think adversity is the foundation of success being born in the Soviet Union living in a studio apartment with a family members when I was a kid going on one and a half baked ations my entire childhood my parents buying me nothing because they didn't have like the money nor the mines. To do that for me is fundamentally. The reason I'm successful at entrepreneurship. I'm not scared of anything nor do I care about anybody else's judgment, which allows me to navigate very quickly and my losses are my losses and my wins are my wins and they both feel the same when I hear the accolades or when I get razzed. I basically can't hear them. I'm just so in love with the process and that's and that's what getting up off the floor is Is you had no choice you just it's in your DNA to want to play. Yeah, you know like, you know, and I think that self-awareness for the executives and the founders and the different people in this room is an incredibly important foundation to the conversation right now both for the entrepreneurs but also for the key Executives and employees of an organization and the responsibility of the number one to put players in the best position to succeed is a Formula that really matters. It's funny you say that I So I didn't I think entrepreneurs have this thing after a sort of a big loss where you have this people writers talk about writer's block. The can't I couldn't think of anything that was interesting. I remember I took a job selling Employee Engagement Services, which was not fun at all. Like the fact that the business exists is fat and I don't always in that business here, but I remember I went back to Chattanooga and I went and speaking of Ted again. I was in his office and that was what the hell are you doing? Like why aren't you an entrepreneur? Why don't you get back in the game? And he was the guy sort of pushed me to say get back into it like go back and do it. And the thing was this time. It was sort of Phyllis. I didn't care. I knew what it was like and I burned a bunch of cash day trading because I thought that was I was going to make my fortune don't do that either and I opened up at a Bank of America zero in Taiga credit was anything that really had and open up a zero credit zero balance or zero APR credit card and I ran up $50,000 Bank of America is my first investor, and it was fun to kind of get back in. Game, they don't know that I did pay it off which was actually fun. But it was fun to get back in the game after having done it and sort of saying that hey there is a sort of a natural desire but I think what drives has driven me and I would imagine it drives other entrepreneurs that is that they've had sort of this fake success. They thought there was a classical and then it all went away and then they had to go back and build it again. Well good because that's what we're going to see in the next chapter this year the amount of people that celebrate when they Andres is laughable. I mean 98 percent of Silicon Valley startups lose money each month. Like I don't know if you heard but it doesn't take a hero to lose money each other up. So yeah, I mean a lot of them think that they're successful yet. They haven't made a single Cent In profit, which is the lifeline of a business that isn't in a position to raise more capital and I do think that what's amazing about the game is here we are and we're talking about when will it happen. What's the bubble and literally tomorrow you could wake up and bear Stern can happen and it starts to Domino the other direction and it's that quickly. Right, you know you got an entrepreneur sitting now in year three and she's about to turn the corner right? She's been losing 80,000 a month and now two more months and she's gonna have this or that or the other thing and we're going to be making money and all of a sudden, you know, they you know, they're on, you know, third and 1/2 base on raising their next round which will give them that are cover and boom the news comes out in the morning that XYZ Bank. Does this or the college debt crisis has done wire. Or China did Z and the investor pulls out. Nobody else is interested and six months later. They're not a business. Yeah. So what is your message to those startups? And there's some of the room make profit. It's that simple, right? Yeah, I can't argue with that. So, you know like And and to the startups in the room, like if this kind of hit you like, huh, that makes some sense or you got your spidey say senses going like you go and audit your expenses. Like what are you paying for fruit bars or you know, like, you know, who's the three employees that bring no value to the company anymore, but you have a sense of loyalty like run an actual business and I think that overfunded added lots of money in the system is no different than being a super spoiled kid, you know, like if your parents buy you a BMW on your 16th birthday. You're soft. Yeah. It's nothing wrong with being soft. There's nothing wrong with being soft. But you're fucking soft. So let's talk about you mentioned cold chills talking about culture and I've you've talked about this is that people who are who are dragging down the culture of a business should be they shouldn't be there. You should get rid of immediately. I am a big fan of this. Let's talk about this is I mean, this is it's interesting because there's there's a view of higher slope. Are fast and there's also a view of if you have someone who's cancer was to your business. I think a lot of businesses get caught up in trying to document and coach and it just it just goes nowhere right if their cancer I wish most businesses weren't to documenting and Coach what most businesses are doing is Heralds of dick, but his numbers are remarkable. Yeah, that's what's really happening. That's what I'm referring to that if you've got somebody who's driving top line revenue, or is she or he is crushing the numbers what most companies are doing is they're looking at surface level. They're like ooh, if we fire Carol, we're going to lose those three accounts because she's so wired in there what they don't realize is the hidden lost Revenue that's happening with Carol or Harold destroying the culture and completely Messing up the continuity and speed of the macro. So what do you do from your point of view? What do you do? If you have if you have someone who's really kicking ass bringing the numbers in and they're just a they're a jerk. What do you do with them? What I do one one man's point of view is I sit them down. I looked him dead in the face and I say you think I'm joking because you're delivering, but I'm not joking and if you can't be a good human being I'm going to fire your face. That's that's pretty right there. Right? That's what I do and I do it and I do it. You know, I'm a big shot on stage now and I'm acting tough. I do it. I do it in a conversation. I'm like, look, I'm not Kiddin like I know you don't believe me because you've worked in other places that value dollars and I value dollars. I just value slow dimes, right? And so you're gonna screw me up you're not liked. There's a problem here a it's my fault because this is my company. So tell me what I've done wrong to You in this position. Do you hate Stevie or something going on at home? Like what am I missing nine out of ten times, you're missing nothing. It's just unfortunately, you know, because before we even get to that conversation you you're trying to figure out what's wrong and then 3 out of 10 times remarkably people do take a left turn because they get scared straight or they had it in them or normally they're insecure and so I spent 40 of the 50 minutes. I'm trying to make them feel safe. Yeah and and 7 out of 10. Time 10 times you fire their face. How long do you give them? You know, it's funny. It's run the gamut and you know, when I think about these 25 conversations as we're talking right now one makes me laugh because it I gave him 24 hours because literally the next day they like we're ridiculous other times. It's been a couple weeks a couple months not usually more than two months after that conversation for me, but everybody has their own tolerance. It's remarkable what happens when you make that decision the buy-in from the To the crew that you knew because most employees think that the big boss that she or he have no idea what's actually going on that they live in an ivory tower that they don't know what's going on in the details that that employees tricking them that they're looking the other way because of money. So when you deliver on culture the buy-in in the macro is remarkable and what it does for the business is extraordinary. I'm a I'm a pot committed buyer of this thesis that you have to fire. The best performers that are destroying your culture. How big is your team? What's the size better? Media is a thousand people. Wow. Okay and how long you guys been around? We've been around for nine and a half years nine and a half years. And so you've hired a lot of people. Yes, you've also interviewed a lot more people. Yes, when you bring someone in to the organization, do you interview every single candidate? I do not I did the first 300 I would say, okay, and I do obviously at a certain seniority level. And I try to meet with every employee within the first year, but I don't hire everybody. That's probably a good thing because I'm probably an all-time ridiculous higher. I usually hire people within the first three minutes in my head and I actually have our I have no I literally walked round of questions for you. You're gonna lie. Anyway, like who cares? Let's just get to it. I am the same way. I think his problem. Well, sometimes I work too hard. Like interviewing is what is the worst? What is the worst response you've ever gotten on it? But that I hate that question. Like what's your heart? What's your shortcoming? Like what's a cliche reason you struggle sometimes, you know Gary sometimes I get so passionate about my work that I work extra hard and burn myself out get the fuck out of here. So what is the best answer to that question or the best type of the truth? Right like sometimes I undermine my fellow employees because I want a bonus, you know. You know, honestly I go on intuition. I hire remarkably fast. I fire slower than I'd like but I've gotten faster over the last 25 years. Yeah as you get more confidence and I hate negativity and in that I think I've created too much entitlement and have kind of like tried to fix the bad boy too much and over time. I've just gotten better experience matters, so I'm sure is you were one of the First Investors in Uber at the time. It was a it was an unknown start up. What about that business and talk about culture a lot has been said about overs culture and I'm wondering when you first heard that pitch a what did you like about the pitch and then be what is your perspective on the culture issues that have been written about over so I got a long-winded story here. I'll try to go fast number one and if you literally Google my name and Uber and Paris like right now in your phone Gary vaynerchuk Uber Paris, you'll read a Business Insider article. This is just fun for me one day for my grandkids. I was not only am I an early investor in Uber and we'll get to that in a minute because I'm not as early as I should because I passed on the angel round twice like literally Travis came back to me and had coffee with me in San Francisco and kind of like begged me to invest because we were such homies my first book crush it. The only people I acknowledge in the book is my family and one random person. Travis he was investing at that time before Uber and like read the book and gave me some good feedback. Like literally that's how close I was with Travis and I passed twice on the angel Round And if I wrote my normal 25 to 50 thousand dollar check, I would be looking at somewhere in the ballpark of 500 to 800 million dollars in the next couple of months. So that would be considered a loss and entrepreneur land. But I was literally in the room when it was invented Garrett Camp who was the founder and inventor of a company that some of you might remember called stumble upon which was a cool website back in the day. Literally literally I can it's crazy. I'm sitting in the couch post this keynote. I gave at late web 2008, I think nine. He's sitting on the ground right over there having like some whiskey and he looks up at like eight people he goes. You know, what do you think about a limb? What do you think? Would it be cool if? On your phone there was an app and you could order a limousine that could pick you up right away. And I remember the first hot second. I'm like that's a rich person's problem. Right? Like I'm like, yeah, okay fine, but like and and then a couple months later I saw him and he's like, hey that thing we're doing it's real. It's called Uber cab now, that's the original name of uber Uber cab. And at first they it was a side project because Travis was investing Garrett, I think. Bought back StumbleUpon from the company AOL. I can't remember who bought it and they literally hired another person to be the CEO and Outsource the building of it. So it was a side project. So the biggest reason I didn't invest was because it was a side project that a couple months later Travis jumped in ran it and it became what it became as far as the culture, you know, listen at the end of the day. This is why I speak so much about culture. I'm Early on I have no concept during that era Travis went super like head down and I spoke to him like three times this book to Garrett zero times. I I had you know, I'm not on the board. I'm not an Advisory board. So I have as much insight to the culture as you do which is you're reading it through the press and through employees posting on blogs. And so you take it for what it is, but ultimately it was enough pressure for Travis to not be running the company he built which is something every entrepreneur would fear and not want to Happen it's why it's super important is there's been the IPO coming up. He's not going to be the ringing of the bill. Do you think that's the right decision for Uber? I didn't know that until they cannot let him on the stage. It's too bad. You know, it's look what I don't know is how look everything stems from the top. So the culture is is on him. I'm fascinated by the board's power. Like I'm very caught here three variables running through my head in real time one. I'm skewed because Travis is my friend. So already I'm not a clean piece of data to even if he wasn't and I didn't know him. I'm always Pro operator anti board, right because the operators in the trenches the board is on the sidelines. Pontificating I don't know why they decided to do that. I understand it, you know, the the probably massively distracting. I'm sure everybody wants the stock to do. Well Travis is on to his next thing. Anyway, I wonder how much he cares or doesn't care. But you know, somebody's already built one business that he doesn't operate anymore, which was the building of my dad's liquor store business into an e-commerce Giant in the wine space watching my best friend and my dad operate that. Company is heartbreaking. I know the feeling I could because they're not running at the way. I would want to run it. So when you build something and it goes into a different place, it's tough. You know, I have a lot of I mean ultimately like in a lot of ways. That's the right decision a lot of ways. It's the wrong decision. I think ultimately like who gets to judge. I don't know when you're a Thanksgiving dinner or your family. Do you did you have a tendency to tell them what to do what you would do? What was we had such a weird ebony flow right? Because I got into my dad's business. My dad comes to America with a hundred dollars in his pocket and in seven years owns his own liquor store. It's such a remarkable accomplishment. I come into my dad's business. It's a 3.8 Million Dollar business doing ten percent gross profit and I build it from that to a 60 million dollar business in six years with no Capital no credit line. And so there's these two massive Dynamics in play, right which is you know, immigrant makes good. Whiz kid Like it's a it's a real interesting tension and you couldn't find two operators who agree only on 10% and then disagree on 90% more than me and my dad and so there was constant friction, which was very aggressive in a good way and a not so good way family business Dynamics now that I've been out of it for let's say really out of it for the last four or five years. I don't because I'm Pro. Operator anti board. Have you learned the hard way? Like no, I have it. I it was he I don't want to be a hypocrite about that the second I stopped running it day to day. They got to run it. Yeah at my two cents or bullshit. I keep him to myself. They asked me a lot and I'm thrilled but I'm just unbelievably not interested in throwing my two cents at something. I'm not willing to operate because I don't like when people do that to me. I love when people like I love when employees Carrie you know what you don't know. I'm like tell me Sarah tell me what I don't know, you know, like people, you know, think about for everybody here when you started your career and you manage nobody how much you shit on your manager and then the second you started managing people. You got a totally different perspective right? Remember all those things you thought about your parents until you became a parent, you know, I just I just think people are funny when they don't sit with all the context right one of my favorite reasons to sit with employees. I do it a lot is for those conversations when somebody gets a little bravado and starts throwing stuff at me. I always treat that with respect and then I throw 87,000 things that them that they have no idea about and then they leave with their tail between their legs and I feel pumped. I I can empathize with that Daniel Pickett. So I wanted to dive it. You have a board by the way. No, you don't have or this is you completely bootstrap this business. Yes. And it was your what your dad's wide business that you built online you built this massive business and you probably picked up for but I didn't parlay it. What I did was this interesting part of my story I built my family business, but I'm an immigrant not an american-based family business what that means is it's the dad's business until he dies. So I built this business from three to 60 million and at 34 years old because we poured all the money back into the business and I never paid myself more than $100,000 a year. I go and start Vayner. Area with my brother and I have to start it in the conference room of Buddy media a great SAS business that did extremely well and so the Salesforce because I had no money, right? So you have this great accomplishment on your resume of building this monster business and you have no Financial benefit from it I should credit I had nothing so at 34, I bootstrap Vayner the one great thing. I had to hovering we mentioned it earlier even though I didn't pay myself more than seventy eighty a hundred. A thousand back to like making money versus spending money running a p&l. I lived in a shitty apartment. I bought nothing and I worked every day. So I had over this eight year period you know a hundred two hundred thousand dollars saved and then I invested all of it. I took my bank account to 0 because I decided Silicon Valley was going to happen and the first three companies I invested in word Facebook Twitter and Tumblr right? And so I'm rich but more importantly than that. When I started Vayner when I started Vayner in 2009, it was already obvious that Facebook was going to win it was obvious that Twitter was doing super well, so I had no money but I had these assets that were looming that I had some confidence on and then I bootstrapped vaynermedia and it's just completely through social media. That was how you built it and YouTube or vaynermedia the company itself at that point. I'd written. Oh right when I started vaynermedia crush it came out for months. Later, and it was the book about social media that became kind of this book on the back of what I did in the wine business more but it built awareness around me which led to a couple of first clients for vaynermedia Pepsi Gillette and that started the process and why did they want you is it just because you could reach it you reach a different audience. I at that point had eight hundred thousand Twitter followers and Pepsi the business had 400. Wow, and they were like, why do you have that and people are Going to understand that there was something in the air about social media. And at first our company was $5,000 a month to do community management for Brands. So camels paid us $5,000 a month to reply to people on Twitter. And remember the old Facebook where every comment showed up on the wall. And so we you know, people be like Campbell's your soup sucks and we're like, sorry, you know, so at first it was Community Management and Then it evolved from there. So, you know Freight transportation is a very older it's you know, it's a very old industry and up until recently there hasn't been a lot of venture investment. And so where we talked about the bubble the bubble didn't you know, I think there's arguments whether is a bubble and I think the great ones of view, it's still there hasn't been a substantial if you take like fintech and and and broader consumer plays and brought her internet plays. It's a very small amount of money to us. Going really fast and it's growing exceptionally fast, but one of the things I find interesting is the traditional freight companies don't understand marketing companies that the only ones that are doing a good job of it are the big parcel companies, which is really, you know, FedEx and UPS, which is because they're more consumer-centric. That's right. So the B2B says a lot of folks in this room that are predominately B2B and what you guys have massively felt the benefits of is something that I've been yelling about for a half a decade which is if you're in B2B, you have to act like a media company not an Advertiser. ER FedEx and UPS or advertisers, you know, you're acting like a median properly we do but I think the broader audience in this room when you look at Mark, what is it? I'd love for you to tell them to spend money with me, but I'm not going to do that. What is it that you would recommend to folks in the room that as you think about marketing branding you talk a lot about taking advantage of social media take advantage of Facebook and Linkedin as one that you do. I'd love for you to dive into the future of media and marketing the advice that I think will play for. But in the room regardless of what you do including if like you're the PTA president or thinking about running for local office, like I have no idea what you want to do professionally or personally, but the one thing that has been tried and true and I keep things extremely simple is you have to reverse engineer the audience you're trying to reach and you have to tell them something that brings them value. Not you value. Very simple it is this simplest model of it. I think most most marketing and PR agencies that we talked to it's you get the copy if they write it. It looks like marketing company. Nobody's going to read it when we were in our journals, right? It is an editorial piece where it's written in a way that's written more like a journalist read it he gets read it because it's not overflow it and that's not just about us but he's a PR Company and the salesperson are in the business of selling and a journalist is in the business of informing. It's fundamentally different like the biggest reason I've popped is every piece of content. I put out a LinkedIn Facebook YouTube by podcast. I'm desperately trying to figure out how does this bring value for the other person not how am I going to sell vaynermedia or sneakers or wine the end? It's it's unbelievably basic. This is like Bible shit. Yeah, and you pop out a lot of content and you do that. I mean a substantial amount of content. One of my favorite things is your micro videos is Taking you have a videographer that follows your or they're here. By the way. He was just chasing somewhere. I'm sure but we have it filming right there. So but you film yourself. And you take parts of that and turn it into product. I'd love for you to hear three years ago. I took a very interesting move that I probably debated for six-month talk about someone who genuinely doesn't is very capable of taking negative and positive feedback lives a life where he's comfortable navigating through judgment. And even for me it took me a good six months to say, okay. Am I okay with a human being follow me around and filming me at all time. Is heavy charlatan heavy like it's uncomfortable territory, especially three years ago, but I saw blogging voting on YouTube and the vloggers were first person and I'm not I'm running a huge company. I'm an executive. I'm not going to be walking around with a camera like this. I'm also not a filmmaker or have that talent, but I knew that if I would fill my day to day that I could put out a vlog and show real entrepreneurship, you know instead of Like the watches and the baby giraffes and traveling and you know, I wanted to show people like meetings and work and like the stresses of actually running a business and to I knew that I would be able to make this micro content, you know, the amount of pieces of content that I put on LinkedIn that get two three four million people to see it and all it was was 47 seconds. I mean it's going to happen here one or two of these questions is going to be cut down and put on LinkedIn and it's going to bring awareness to who I am which then Bring awareness to the things I do or the things I believe and so yeah, I believe not only do I believe every business is a media company. I believe every humans a media company and I also am very comfortable with somebody not liking that people don't like personal brands or when I make that statement that like and that's fine. You don't have to be a media company, but you can be I'm not telling you that you have to do it. I'm telling you that there's a lot of opportunity around it and it's not that hard right with social media. Leah I mean there are in trucking there are truck drivers which have 1020 30,000 40,000 followers. They use a GoPro or they use their iPhone and they're in the cab talking about story. They're breaking stories faster than sometimes we break them and we have professional journalists and it's interesting because they bring perspective. They have these sort of cult like thought their Heroes of the driving Community, but there's no investment and I'm wondering if companies that do billions of dollars that do a Or a job of communicating their brand and their values their whether it's recording drivers or extinct the brand then these truck drivers and and not dismissive. They're smart as hell that do it in the cab of the truck and and you talked a lot about that watch this real quick. If you can appease me, it's early. It's good to get blood flowing real quick. If you are now a human being that mainly watches HBO GO Netflix Hulu or DVR that if you mainly Zoom your TV now in a OTT Netflix kind of environment, please stand up real quick just stand up if the far majority of TV you watch outside of live sports is done in this environment. I'm going to wait. I want to make sure everybody does this let's look around. I want everybody look around. Let's all agree that this is not a fifteen-year-old teenage crowd right and cheese 8090 percent. You can sit. Thank you 80 to 90% of this audience now mainly Just television without even the ability to see a commercial. Yeah, right and for the 10% that we're still sitting that when they watch Network TV shows right or cable news that when it goes to a commercial they grab their phone and live their life. They're not sitting quietly and patiently to consume a TV commercial 70 billion dollars is spent in America a year to produce and distribute TV commercials. Not a soul is consuming them. Hmm Super Bowl. Yes, I would buy Super Bowl all day long, but that's exactly what you just said. It's happening in every facet of every part of the land people are spending enormous amounts of money on what worked yesterday and they're demonizing what's happening today. Yeah. I mean I look at my look at my kids. My son's I have two kids don't like it. I apologize the rear end and then I'll let you go. The reason I said, this is not a fifteen-year-old crowd the argument about Facebook and YouTube and social media. Everybody goes into I look at my kids and they do X. I'm trying to remind you that these old fuckers do that too. It's rare, but it lightly but that but that matters right because what businesses do is there like Gary I see you're right. I see it with my kids. I'm like no. No the 57 year old guy that you're trying to reach. He's not seeing that television commercial either. So let's have a conversation. No, I think that's its spot on getting to two kids. They're my kids YouTube. They don't watch they don't watch anything. But your tube. We have every channel that you can possible to get. They watch any of it. One of them watch Amazon Prime video and streaming shows. They're not tuning into cable. I don't even think they turn on the box and we have a nobody's running here from this conference to run home and carefully go through the direct mail. Right, right. And nobody here is clicking a banner ad. Yeah, nobody wants to open an email spam and people here LinkedIn spam everybody but never opened one of their Lincoln spams. And so there's all this stuff that's going on tons of money and energy spent and the reality is it's not reaching the consumer. So how you if you have a marketing executive in this room. What is the message for them? They've taken over this this new this old-school. This billion-dollar business the responsible for marketing it and the rules have changed on them. What would you say they could do to really Drive brand equity and education become educated and how what is the what's the goal there to me going on the internet and typing in things like how to like literally typing into Google how to start a podcast for a B2B company literally going into Google and saying how to run LinkedIn ads tool and set In figure contract deals like the amount of things that I've seen happen in the B2B space on SAS companies. I've invested in or GE or sap or clients. I've worked with all of them over index when they act like media and all of them under index when they try to do 1999 B2B marketing like there's like it's unbelievably to to watch people still buy full-page ads in a B2B magazine in a print magazine. That's right, and and it's interesting. So real quick, I've empathy for these Executives because you know, a lot of them actually know what to do. But the company they work for rewards through their internal scoring the old game but they haven't created metrics how to measure the new game and I keep telling them. Why don't you just measure business results not Impressions. Like literally I had a client. That's a Gary look we just keep doing PR because we have a meeting every quarter and it says we got 47 billion PR And I laughed because they know I know everybody knows that they got 47 Impressions not 47 billion, but they count all these crazy reporting. So the first thing a very senior marketing executive needs to do is go have a real debate with the board or the CEO about how marketing is measured if it's not being measured by actual business results, you know, we in my business we look at a lot of the media in this space and and have looked at some Acquisitions and the challenge is That a lot of the these Publications are print-based and the decisions and Freight are happening faster and faster same day next day service, most of the transactions. Most of the tender transactions are within 48 hours. So when these when you go out on print and you print something the market has already moved on You by the time it gets there but there is still a substantial amount of investment in print Publications and those businesses are dying they still the mentality of those organizations is still very pretty. Centric we hire a writer from a print publication the Legacy front they first it's a culture shock of like wait, I've got to report this is up in 30 minutes and it's just a different world. It's because the movie the news is moving so fast and I just think it's a different paradigm shift. I mean paper newspapers all I think I'd read 60% of newspapers between the next five years are expected to fill because they just can't respond to the digital environment. But you have New Media properties chatter you guys are are actually doing quite well. Yeah, I mean look, I mean this is just such a fun conversation have them fascinated by people's inability to understand the technology changes our culture like we used to ride horses to get around. We don't anymore. Yeah, you know like the radio was the number one item in our society boxing and baseball became and horse racing where the major sports in this country because it was a great sport for radio. But then when television came that's where the football Rose because football is a great television sport like things evolve and you know again this notion of holding the past on a pedestal because you understand it or because it's safe is why companies go out of business. So what do you what do you do? Our business is not freightways but the logistics sector yes is is in many ways under attack by Silicon Valley. It's attacked by Amazon its attack by retailers. It's just constantly The Regulators everybody wants a piece of this massive industry and it's becoming really hot sector. I'm wondering what's the message to a company that that doesn't have Innovation as a core part of their business there. How did they Respond by letting themselves die, but what do they do? If I don't want to die innovate and how do they do that? What's the secret by looking at the leader of the company in the mirror and see if she or he is capable of innovating everything stems from the top. If you run if you have a company run by somebody who right now is sitting and saying well, I'm retiring in 18 months and I don't give a shit about Innovation. You're in trouble. For not talented enough to know how to innovate. Like you don't need a is number one's higher a CMO and say you figure it out, but they don't even know how to judge it. How are you a CEO in 2019 and don't spend a hundred hours to educate yourself on how modern communication works so that you can judge it within your own organization. Gary I didn't grow up with this stuff. You didn't grow up driving you figured it out. Like I know you didn't grow up with it, but it is your job to it's required of you to know how to run your business and to me how your business markets and communicates is as important as you knowing how to run the finances of your company. It's just that some people don't want to put in the work to get updated on the new platforms and the new world and that's to their Peril. What am I? Investors on my board when he first invested in the company and our marketing wasn't great. We we sort of evolved and he told me because the most successful companies that are able to raise capital and are able to sort of disrupt it have really strong understanding instincts about marketing and branding is very very important to them and I look at the transportation space and a lot of times the CMO is also the head of cells and their put it in the same person and they seem to me to be very disparate. All sets a cell shape is quite different and wondering if you could talk about your observations in that. Yeah. I mean, I'm a marketer and a salesperson are fundamentally different with the same objective with different time frames for that objective. Most companies are Market our sales people like they want short-term results and building brand takes a long time and bringing value to a customer with the ability to then monetize three years from then is a totally different. We'll set them cold calling somebody and getting a sales and and there are people that do both. Listen. I'm very proud that I do both. I've done both my whole life. I like both which is probably why I can see how different they are. I think somebody sitting in the audience who feels like they're both could understand this man, they're different and if you're wondering the other the other ones very foreign, you know salespeople shit on marketers, right because they're like so poofy poofy smoothie stuff. We get stuff done. I mean some money today right those what are they doing? Does that sign what is that logo like and then marketers make fun of sales people because Nike doesn't sell they built a brand right? And so Intel makes fun of you know, so the two very different things. I don't mind the CMO sitting at the top but she better know both and she better know how to have a leader in each function that triangles up to her and she needs to keep both sectors super accountable for different kpis and they have that empathy and understanding for each other up. They work together and kpi tied directly into cells. What's the revenue your actions are ready? Yeah, but how one judges that I caught the last part I was getting monk Mike Dunn. You said something that's near and dear to my heart, which is we don't give a crap about our short-term profits were playing long game. So for me, you know, every business I built is in perpetuity. And so as you can imagine the marketer is being judged in a much longer time frame. However, I don't need them like slacking off and like golfing all day like like you have to keep people accountable profit. Yeah, but but like they're just two very different things and you know, I do think and how fast the world works now a marketer can show a business result within a year, but I won't judge them in the first three and a half quarters, right? I think the difference between sales and marketing is sales if we're using football as an analogy has to put up points in every quarter really to be successful because they can't close the gap in the fourth. Order marketing can be down 31 nothing and when 34-31 if they did all the right things in the first three quarters at put no poured into the board in queue for the cat. I like that that's gonna be a clip on LinkedIn. I like it. Well, we just have a few more minutes. Is there anything as this business is this industry goes through massive disruption. You've seen it work out in media and and are seen hit change in media. What is it? You wouldn't know you're not a transportation professionals by trade but you've seen a lot of Industries go through this Evolution. We're at the few sort of compare those two meteorite. I'm not hanging, you know because of Ted and because other things I'm I'm I'm dangerous in my knowledge of what's going Now because of investors and people reach out to me the coyote deal like I'm flirting with the space Here's what's about to happen? You mean you put it right which is technology and like the world is technology and Innovation are going to eat up every sector it started with the bookstore business Bezos just decided that's what he wanted to do. And if you owned a family bookstore or Regional bookstore or even a global bookstore like borders, it was your turn that happened to be 1997. I I spoke at the black car and limo conference one year after Uber launched ironically just randomly and my speaking career and I stood on stage and said you guys are looking the whole vibe there was we're going to use City Hall and the government to stop Uber and I said you're naive Innovation always wins. I don't give a shit how much money you're giving to a politician. And so what I would say is what's clearly happened in this business is we are in the kind of Second quarter of the macro Innovation and money World realizing there's opportunity to innovate because it's there's a lot of mom-and-pop stuff going on a lot of like, you know, tried-and-true stuff that doesn't map the reality of a 20-19 world and I do believe that there's going to be a lot of disruption in this sector more consolidation more money brought in new brands built out of nowhere overnight and I think people need to heed that call like what value are you bringing? Yeah are You a commodity or you a brand and most people are a commodity and they should be invested in there how they Define their brand and how they differentiate it the number one thing in wrapping up like back the tangible advice. I couldn't couldn't say this more passionately every single person here that is empowered to do so needs to go spend the next hundred days having phone calls having dinner having breakfast having drinks with every one of their customers and they need to listen. To what they care about and they need to go back to the pad and cook that meal. That's all I do. I read my comments, you know left and right like, you know, I was just talking with your CMO prepping. You know, you were you guys are wrapping up and she's like, are you always like this on your phone? And I was laughing what I was doing. I was reading comments. Yeah, because the qualitative feedback is the Insight. I need for the next innovation in the amount of people who hope their customers like what they are doing or they're trying to force their customers to like what they want to sell is fascinating for me to watch. You know II just don't understand how people aren't spending all their time interacting with their customer and figuring out what they need based on that in parallel with where they see the world's going. It's a very fine line right? One of my favorite CEOs is Darin with gr. The CEO of T-Mobile. I've never met him. I think the service sucks no offense to mobile. It's bad Network having it had it but I love the brand. I love John legere because he personally answers text messages. He personally tweets it and he also You can communicate you. He's a personality and I think he has a very powerful Green. He's built this very powerful brand not only around him, but around this idea that they're they're punching the AT&T and Verizon face. That's right. And there is a huge variable of success for T-Mobile in that Delta against the quality of their product that Stories the best because one thing that I owe the reason I want everybody to go and talk to their clients is because inevitably they're going to fix their product or service. Service and one thing I always tell people when they hire being a media if I'm in the room or if I'm meeting with an executive. I'm like look what we do. Well is we speed up the process of everybody knowing about you and if your product sucks that only means the World's Gonna know your product sucks faster. So, you know, I love marketing Communications. I think it is the foundation of our society. If you really play out the chest moves of innovation what ends up happening is most things become a Aditi and Communications and marketing become the Delta and so I there has never been a more important era to understand your marketing and Communications and as we're wrapping up and I see the clock, please stop being a headline reader and start being a practitioner the amount of people here who have power to make calls that make decisions about Facebook or LinkedIn or YouTube or podcasting because they read an article versus the fact that they've actually run an ad or run out.

The amount of people that have thoughts about Facebook and Cambridge analytic or things of that nature, but I've no idea what it means. You know, I couldn't be more passionate in reminding everybody. This will be the Great era of practitioners not headline readers and everybody's got to Sense on why something doesn't work for them. This yet, they've never actually done it and that to me is hypocrisy at the highest order.

We figured it out not had zero experience of doing this 0 and we reverse we figured out the model using data and informed information. That's why and to wrap up before I think words matter. I think people because of the way social media grew in our society started as a kid thing. Sing the word social media throws people off guys.

Immelt, who was born and raised in New York, moved to Chattanooga five years ago and co-founded LinkedIn in 2014.

It's not just a great daytime television program. It is also the theme of this GCSE business part of the episode episode definitely episode. So I enjoy from Seneca and today I am going to be talking through business locations for your GCSE business exam. Let's go a business or firm has to choose a location that provides it with the best environment for it to produce and sell products. Most effectively. There are five one, two, three four. Or five main factors that influence where business will choose to locate number one is the availability of raw materials how much this matters to a fam depends on what type of Industry it is for manufacturing firms like London Brick Company being close to raw materials, like clay deposits can cut the cost of transporting raw materials. Some firms are less affected by their proximity and availability of raw materials access of clay deposits doesn't really matter to Facebook. Labor nationally location effects wage rates and the level of labor. Skip certain areas are more heavily focused on manufacturing. And so the local Workforce is skilled in manufacturing historically Manchester was very strong and Manufacturing and London has a large pool of software development labor in big cities. The rage wage rate is usually higher than in rural towns labor International labor costs vary are different from country to Country. She's such as Sweden and Norway their minimum wage is very high compared to countries like China and India. This is one reason, why lots of companies like Primark and night set up production plant in developing countries, like Bangladesh competition being near to competitors means that it is easier to find skilled workers because they are already local suppliers. And there is already demand for this type of Labor this partly explains why we see lots of similar businesses very close together in cities or on the edge of a busy town in Canary Wharf there are lots of backs. But please Goldman Sachs JP Morgan and on the edge of towns are often lots of garages or car spare parts firms or rent rent also varies a lot between different pieces renting floor space on a main High Street in London will be very expensive relative to renting for space in a smaller town like Keswick, which is in the Lake District if you're wondering location of the markets how important is it to be located close to the market depends on the type of business that is running a high Street. Chao store like Topshop will be more willing to spend extra money to be located in a shopping mall and buy into relatively inexpensive in the center of a city. Like no nauseam. Sorry, it was relatively expensive not inexpensive and tops up want to do this because accessing a lot of customers is important. So what are those five factors that can influence a business has chosen location? They are availability of raw materials cost of Labor composition rent and location of the market five really important factors. Now, we need to also talk about the nature of business activity. So Amazon is an e-commerce form if deliveries can be made nationally or even internationally the company's location may be less important. This means that Amazon is more likely to rent out cheap. out-of-town space unlike Zara which may choose Prime retail space in the city centre price competition Aldi competes with other supermarkets based on price because of this it tends to choose out of town spaces for its stores because the rent is cheaper low labor costs and Manufacturing firm is more likely to want to be located in areas with lower labor costs to allow it to complete to compete with the competition on price Sports Direct has lots of operations in Derbyshire partly because local labor is cheaper than places like London So I'm going to shout out for companies for you. And I want you to tell me which is most likely to rent a space on a business park on the outskirts of town. Hm misguided Zara Topshop. Now, it's going to be a misguided because an online realtor of clothes so they are going to likely rent space out on the outskirts of town. They don't have a storefront so they don't need a High Street expensive location. So what are some factors that influence a business has chosen location? Shouldn't you remember that Famous Five its availability of raw materials cost of rent location of Market competition and the cost of Labor. There's go over another case study will talk about Aldi Aldi compete with other supermarkets based on price. So, where is it more likely to choose to have it shops out of town out of town because it is cheaper. Now. Do you remember Topshop? Why a might they pay more to be located in a shopping mall rather than on the outskirts of town in a business park. It's because it is more accessible for customers more accessible for customers. So that brings us to the end of this episode. I hope it was a useful one. Thank you for joining me and I look forward to joining you on the next episode.

That's the age at which students are required to be in school, and a new law in the UK is making it even harder for young people to get their diploma, the New York Times reports. That's because students who don't pass their exam by the age of 16 can't get their diploma if they're still in high school. That means that if you want to get a job in the UK, you'll have to take the exam before you turn 16, even if you're already in high school. The law is called the Lifelong Learning Act, and it's designed to make it easier for young people to find jobs in the UK, the Times notes. The law was introduced in the House of Commons last week, and it's expected to become law in the Senate as soon as next month, according to the Times. It's not clear how many students will be affected by the law, but the Times notes that it's ""likely to be a major factor in how many jobs are created in the",0.1232876712328767,0.08219178082191782

This is Aztec basketball. What's good as tech fans? It's been a while. There was a holiday break and admittedly I have been away from the microphone and the studio for longer than I had originally planned. All that being said, it's great to be back. I hope everybody had a fun and safe holiday break. I managed to get back to the San Diego area where I grew up. I actually grew up in the Inland Empire. So probably just lost like 20 listeners there, but it's okay. I grew up in the Inland Empire and I went, you know to see my family my brother still lives with my parents and got to see both my mom and my dad so that was great. I thought about going to the Utah game up at Staples Center. I was pretty close to going but my mom's birthday is actually right around Christmas as a couple days couple days away from Christmas. And so we ended up taking my mom out to a birthday lunch instead of going to the Utah game because family is important and it all worked out because sometimes it's nice to be in the stadium or not the stadium in the arena and other times it's nice to have your own couch to relax on where you're watching basketball. So it's all good there. Before we get started. I want to remind everybody to follow like subscribe all the all the you know stuff anchor dot f m / has take break down. You can find it on iTunes. You can find it on Google podcast. You can find me on YouTube. Find me on Twitter all the stuff you guys know the drill. There's a couple things I want to talk about today before going into the game previews. I don't want to make this too long. But if you've been listening for a while, you know that I can have a tendency to ramble on a little bit the stuff that I want to talk about is mostly stuff that some of it I've pointed out on Twitter but Twitter is so hard to introduce context into what you're trying to say because of the character limit and I don't want to drive it. Say over Twitter. So a lot of stuff I say for the podcast. First off. I want to talk about trade Pulliam tray Pulliam has been slowly but surely improving and it's been nice to see I've been kind of thinking that there would be one game where would just kind of start to click? You know, we'd have like this major Breakout game and then after that he would be good and that hasn't happened which for a while was a little bit disappointing because I've been feeling like it should happen, but when you look at the numbers, Especially the advanced numbers Pi PPM being my favorite is numbers have improved both defensively and offensively he was a major negative on offense to start the season and he has improved in that regard and he's above average on offense and he's even better on defense and the last game against Utah State especially in the first half. I thought he played really well. He looked really good on tape. His numbers were solid. I think was seven points and five assists. So that was awesome. And I think he's showing the type of progress that debtor gets out of his players. I think Trey Pulliam is the best example of that this year. He's shown that progress and especially come March time. I think he will still be improved from where he's at right now. And that's really encouraging we can talk about the team defense here for a minute. The team defense has been amazing and I think they're pretty much across the Spectrum like a top 10 or top 15 defense in the nation, which is really exciting for a couple reasons one before the season. I thought defense was going to be the weakness, you know, this team didn't seem to have any good individual Defenders and it's I mean, you can run a good team defense without good individual Defenders because so much This about communication and positioning and all this other stuff helping each other out so you can have a good defense but it's hard to have a truly great defense unless you have these really good individual Defenders and we had Nathan Mensa down low. So that was always going to be the starting point. But Yanni Wetzel has been really good download there are some metrics that say, he's been even better than Nathan men sub. I wouldn't quite go that far but regardless he's been really good cage. AJ Fagan has been probably one of the better defenders in the conference, which seems like it's saying a lot especially considering how low I was on his defense to start the season just from what I had seen but he's finding ways to impact games when his scoring isn't there and a lot of that has been on the defensive end of the ball and watching him hassle Sam marrow. It wasn't just him. It was combination of him and Malachi Flynn and Adam Seiko, but the most impressive plays I saw in San Merrill Came from KJ Fagan. And so watching his defense has been truly amazing based off of what I was expecting at the very least. He's KJ Fagan is greatly exceeded expectations. But I mean even aside from that the individual defense has shown up from Fagan from Seco from Matt. Mitchell has been improved on defense you honey. What's only the Mensa but even then I think the team defense is it's one of the whole is greater than the sum of its parts deals where even with the guys performing well on an individual level the team defense is still Level higher than that and why that's encouraging to me is I mean, it's one of the coaching clichés but defense travels, you know, and what you see a lot of times with these teams that rely on three-point shots like the Aztecs kind to do to a certain extent they can score inside with the best of them also, but I think when the Aztecs are at their full gear they're hitting those three point shots. But when that shot leaves, what do you have to fall back on and you'll see teams at the college and at the professional level that when that shot leaves them they have nothing else to go to they don't have an inside game. They don't have a defense that can keep men until their shot comes back. And so the Aztecs playing such exceptional defense will keep them in the game against pretty much any opponent. I haven't I don't watch a lot of the national games. I don't have a lot of time on my Hands to watch basketball. It's sometimes even hard to watch the San Diego State Games. But I haven't seen a team either in highlights or in a full game that I've thought this team is way ahead of where San Diego State is especially with San Diego State's defense. So that is absolutely encouraging and raises the floor for this Aztec team a whole lot. Another thing. This is more quick. Just thought that I had was there was a play it was just one play in the Utah State game where Matt Mitchell drove into the lane and he drew help and he kicked the ball out. I think he kicked it out to Jordan shackle and then shackle hit the three and It showed to me what it showed was a little bit of development from him as well similar to the train of thinking with Trey Pulliam because Matt Mitchell generally speaking even this year if he gets the ball and he starts dribbling the ball, you know, he's gonna attack pretty much he's he makes his decision on whether he's going to pass pretty early, you know, and that doesn't mean he's a ball hog. That doesn't mean doesn't pass the ball. He's good at moving the ball and switching the sides of the Court. With the ball being that guy up top, he's good at those things, but when he catches the ball if he starts to dribble a couple times you kind of know he's trying to size his guy up to attack the basket. And so watching him drive in draw the help and then kick the ball out that to me is probably the next step in his development and that's assuming he can stay as effective and as consistent as he has I think the weight loss has really helped with that. That was the hope with the weight loss was that it would help with his consistency because he's always been really talented but his consistency especially last year in his sophomore year wasn't very great and this year he has been very consistent. And so if he can add that Dimension not Even to the point of like a Malachi Flynn, but just adding that one extra thing where if the help comes he can kick it out to somebody else because we have Jordan shackle on the wing. We have Malachi Flint on the wing Yanni can hit the occasional three. They haven't been following yet, but it isn't his history. Same thing with KJ Fagan Adam Seco can hit the three. We have all these perimeter players. And Matt Mitchell is a bowling ball in the paint and you Can't stop him with one guy and so they're going to need to send two or three guys and that will open up some wide open shots on the perimeter. The point being I've been really impressed with Matt Mitchell's growth as well. Okay, I'm jumping around with any without any Rhyme or Reason here. It's just kind of the way my brain works. I apologize for that. Got a couple more things first off. I'd like I'd like to hear from you guys a little bit just to see if this thought is is valid or if I'm overstepping anything anything of that nature, but I at the moment think that Malachi Flynn has earned if the season was to end today. He's earned a place on the All-American team. Maybe not the first team maybe the first team. I mean you can make an argument for it, but for sure the second team and at the very least the third team, I think Malachi Flynn should be on one of those lists the main argument for that. From from my point of view would be that Malachi Flynn as I'm recording. This is ninth in the nation in player impact plus minus and I'm not going to go deep into what player impact plus minus is. I've explained it a couple times. You can find it elsewhere as well. I'll probably explain it later, but he's ninth in the nation right now in this in this metric that is probably the best one we have available to us. So he's been more impactful than all but eight other players in the nation and before the Utah State game. He was actually ate so he's been in the top ten for a while. And many of the players above him are also big men Vernon carry from duke is one of the players above him Xavier Tillman from Michigan state is one of the players above him some of the players that are Player of the Year favorites are actually below him like Luka Garza is I think 11th in pi p.m. I can look it up real quick. Luca Garza is yes 11th Peyton Pritchard is 12 and those are a couple Couple players that are some of the favorites for player of the year Cassius Winston is actually seventh it looks like so he was the preseason Player of the Year favorite and what this shows is Malachi Flynn is is right on that level and on top of that Malachi Flynn is actually point zero six points per 100 possessions behind Cassius Winston right now to be fair. I think Cassius Winston's impact is going to Continue to raise he you know, he had a rough start to the year with his brother dying at the beginning of the season. This isn't a Michigan State podcast. But the point is right now Malachi Flynn has been playing like a top 10 player in the nation and I think that should be reflected in the All-American teams. And I don't I mean, I don't know. I want to hear what you guys think and if you agree, let's put this this ability that San Diego State fans have to just Spam like the national media heads just at them and say Malachi Flynn should be an All-American because he's a top 10 player in the country and the numbers support that So there's my piece on Malachi Flynn. Let me know what you think if that's maybe a little bit too much or if that's not enough or if it's just right. The last thing I want to talk about is I want to get into can Palm a little bit. I mean if you don't want to hear any more about Ken Palm, you can just skip ahead. That's totally fine. The main thing I want to say about Ken Palm is I've noticed there's a lot of just misunderstanding about what it does. And so when people when I see people that are angry at Ken Palm on Twitter, I get it but you're just I don't think most of them at least are angry for the right reasons. And here's what I mean can Palm when it gives a rank to a team. It's not saying this is the rank the team has earned right now what it's saying is this is Team, this is the earth. Sorry. This is the rank the system thinks the team will have at the end of the year, which is tricky because so much can happen and so much can change in as we see it does change but that's what it's supposed to be. It's supposed to be a predictive model as opposed to a reflective model. And so when the Aztecs are ranked, I believe right now. Let me look it up real quick as I'm recording this they are ranked 16th in the nation. What can Palm is saying is San Diego State will finish 16th in the nation as or at the end of the year, which isn't bad. It's less than we think it should be right now. And if you take the the results that they've had so far San Diego State should absolutely be higher than 16th. And that's why in a lot of metrics and ego state is higher than 16th. A lot of these metrics aren't trying to predict the future. Sure, they're trying to reflect the present. One of my favorite ones that does that is Haslam metrics has a metrics has its own flaws to all systems do but if you want a good reflection of where the team should be right now Haslem metrics is one of my favorites the net the any tea is supposed to be predictive. Or at least more predictive than the RPI was at the very least. That being said its flaws are it just gives arbitrary values to winning and losing games and so it reflects your record as well as everything else. Whereas in can Palm the record is totally irrelevant. All that matters is the point spread and how efficient you are in each side of the ball. All that being said despite San Diego State being 16 and Ken palm, and I don't Tesla metrics pulled up right now. I'm not going to pull it up at last I saw they were sixth the difference between 16 Rank and one rank and can Palm was the same as the difference between six ranking 1 ranked in Haslam metrics. They were both about 10 points per 100 possessions. So they're not that far off. It's just that Ken Palm is predicting right now. Can Palm is predicting San Diego State will finish 16 and 2 in conference and finish with an overall record of 27 and to and so what compromise saying is after it loses those two games San Diego State will be ranked. 16th that's what it's trying to do at least two can Palms credit when you when you do the studies and you look at it about 60% of teams at this point in the season are within 20 spots of where they will finish the season at which is pretty good and there's only about 50 teams out of 353 that will move more than 40 spots. So at this point the can Palm is pretty accurate to what the end of the season will be. The only the the major thing can pom gets complained about is that it takes data from last year to help make its projections because intuitively that doesn't make sense and I agree with that a hundred percent that intuitively it doesn't make sense. But once again when you do the math, it actually helps stabilize those rankings better, which is why in rankings that don't do that. You see a lot more variation after each game. So for example, I'll use the any tea again Utah state was ranked in like the 30s. A week ago and then they lost to I think they lost to UNLV and they drop like 40 spots after one game because it doesn't have that stabilizing factor of the previous season. Can Palm disease that stabilizing factor and it just helps keep things a little bit more stable teams as we have seen can absolutely make big changes over the course of time San Diego State has improved like 80 spot since the beginning of the year. But it's just it's meant to be a stabilizing factor and in about a week or two the previous year's data won't be used at all at this point. The previous year's data is probably adding a game or two to the data. So it's taking 15 and oh from this year and then adding another game or two based off of an algorithm from last year and all this complicated stuff. It's just meant to increase the sample size slightly to make it. Stable with all that I know talking about Kim poong probably isn't the most entertaining thing but I try to run this channel in a way where I talk about things that I would want to hear if I was a listener and to me knowing how the data works and what it's trying to do is is very important. So the short version is if you want an explanation for why San Diego State is lower in can Palm than it is in other metrics. It's because can Palm is saying this is where San Diego State will be at the end of the year. There's other metrics are saying this is where San Diego State is right now. With all that being said, I'm going to stop take a quick break water break and then when I come back, we'll look at the upcoming games for the Aztecs. Let's take a second and talk about anger. A lot of my followers have known for a while that I've been wanting to do some type of podcast, but for one reason or another it just never worked out. Anchor is helping me change that for one. It's a free place to host your podcast and all that stuff. They have all the tools. You need to edit your podcast. They take care of the distribution for you and you can start to get paid for it right away. Which is really cool. If any of my followers want to start their own podcast, you can download the free anchor app on your phone or go to Anchor dot. F m-- to get started. That's ANC hor dot f m Okay, we're back time to get into some game previews. We got two games this week. We got on the road at Wyoming and then we got home at Boise State which apparently the tickets already sold out for so that's awesome. We'll start with Wyoming Wyoming is not a very good team this year. They're currently ranked 297 in can Palm which last I checked? It was last in the Mountain West Conference is look it up real quick. Yep last in the Mountain West Conference three spots below San Jose State. So that's a thing. They're not very good. That being said they're playing at home. Layer me is like 7,000 feet in the air something like that. So altitude will absolutely be a factor. Nathan Mensa is definitely out of this game as is a guaca rope. So some of the bigger Aztec players are out of the game one of them being a starter who before his injury using the method I had used on my last Mountain West wire piece. I think Nathan Mensa was the fifth best player in the conference. So losing him. Is definitely a big blow if you haven't read that piece yet. Go check it out Mountain West wire been writing for them for couple months now. I think it's nothing super formal. I just kind of right when I feel like it and they post it and it's cool. Anyway, so missing a couple players couple tall players. Wyoming's average height is bigger than the Aztecs that being said. They only have two players that are six eight or taller. So their average height is due to having more players in the six five six six six seven range the player the Aztecs will need to look out for the most is Hunter. Muldano. He's I guess Wyoming star player for for lack of a better word. His game is based off of getting to the rim and finishing their and if not finishing then drawing a foul. He's also pretty good at kicking it out to other people to shooters or to ruhlman or Cutters things of that nature. You ranks a hundred and tenth in the nation in assist rate right now and six then the Mountain West so he's a good passers game is based off of getting to the rim. And so what we will likely see the Aztecs do is just try to wall them off before he even starts his Drive whether that's with one person or if he's starting to get around then having that second person come up and close that Gap a little bit before he can get into the paint because if you make them a jump shooter, He's not very good. He's he's OK. He's shooting three-point shots. He's at a about 34% But as a as a two-point jump shooter, he's well below average. He's not very efficient. So that will be the key there Wyoming's offense with muldano as their lead guy is not very good. It's ranked 337th right now in can Palm out of 353 teens their defense has About average drink 266. It's in Ken Palm in can Palm suggested defense? It's actually slightly above average and so scoring would be in theory the issue but it shouldn't be Wyoming will definitely give San Diego State their best shot. The altitude is in Factor as is the travel because Laramie is hard to get to and Ziegler writes a piece seemingly every year about how the Aztecs tried something new whether they take a private plane to a smaller Airfield in Laramie or whether they land in a bigger city and then try to bust to Laramie. It seems like every year they go. Laramie something wrong happened. So that will be a thing. The arena will probably be buzzing that being said. Having the best player on the floor is generally a good predictor of who's going to win a basketball team and San Diego State should probably have the best six or seven players on the floor. So San Diego State should win this. I'm not saying it will be easy because conference games never are but San Diego State should be able to pull this one out for sure. Moving on to Boise State Boise State might be able to give some serious matchup problems. Now Boise State referencing That Mountain West wire article. I did. Again Boise State had I think two of the top 10 players in the conference and a third one in the top 20, so they have some Talent. I'm kind of surprised that they're in the spot where they're at the rink 210 and Ken Palm. They're you know, they're a good team but they're not a great team. They're two and two in the conference with losses to Nevada and New Mexico. So those are the teams that you would generally put in there seemed grouping if you were going to tear the Mountain West The thing that concerns me about Boise state is related to their size at least so they are they have a greater average height than Wyoming does for starters. They similarly to Wyoming. They only have two players that are six eight or taller. One of those players is Derek Alston, though who measures in at six nine and despite being six nine is still a perimeter player. So he's kind of like one of these Kevin Durant guys who's super tall but plays a lot on the wing Derek Alston can definitely be a matchup problem and he's basically the guy that makes the Boise State offense go and run. He's not the most efficient offensive player on the team. That would be RJ Williams is the most efficient player on the team who checks in at six seven. So some good size there as well and then the other Her name I think that is important to know is Justinian Jessup who also checks in at six seven. Those are the three names to look out for Boise State is Above average on both sides of the ball. They're pretty balanced. No side sticks out more than the other but this matchup with Derek Alston, especially with Nathan Mensa being out that moves Yanni to the 5 and Yony has surprised me with his foot speed on defense this year and I think he's been able to keep up with perimeter players pretty well. That would have been nice to have Nathan Down Low and then Ian he's still on the perimeter to check a guy like Derek Alston. Even if he couldn't a hundred percent keep up with them just make him work a little bit and then run them into Nathan type of thing. But with you oniy playing Center, it will probably be somebody like Matt Mitchell on Derek Alston and Mitchell has the the the strength to come back with Derek Alston, I would think but Derek Austin is three inches on him and probably even more so with his wingspan. He looks to me like a pretty long guy. So Derek Austin might be able to just Rise over the top and shoot basically. His his to point jump shots aren't very good. So kind of a similar profile to Hunter. Muldano, Derek. Austin wants to get to the rim and finish. The difference is Derek Alston also has a better three-point shot. And so that's what you got to worry about. You do have to close out on him. And then if you'd if you do if when you do closeout hard he can attack that. That get to the rim, that's what he really wants to do and just that sizes 6-9 as a little bit worrisome. I do think the Aztecs should still be favored, especially at home. We have seen how the Essex kind of play to their level of competition, which can be a little bit discouraging Boise state is going to bring it because they would love to be the first team to give San Diego State a loss, especially in Viejas. I do remember however many years ago. It was now for years As five years. I don't remember for sure three years. Some it wasn't five but three or four years ago when the Aztecs were playing Boise and Boise broke the streak of winning games when you were ahead of five minutes to go. So Boise state has done this type of thing before they're coached by Leon rice who's a good coach. They have some Talent they have some size. I think they can pose a matchup problem. If I was a betting man, I'd still bet for San Diego State to win, especially with that sold-out crowd at Viejas. But of the two games, this is the one that worries me most which is saying something considering this is the one that's at home without elevation and travel and stuff. That's what I got and I'll give other other breakdowns and stuff on the day of the game today for me is Tuesday. So tomorrow is the Wyoming Game and Saturday is the Boise State game. So look out on Twitter for me to post the pi PM's of the players and the keys to the game and all that stuff. This has been the Aztec breakdown podcast. Thank you very much for listening. Remember to find me on YouTube Twitter. Patreon all the stuff and I will catch you next time Aztec fans.","– The San Diego State Aztecs are off to the best start in program history, having won their first 13 games of the season, the AP reports. And they're off to a pretty good start in the Mountain West, too, with a 9-1 record so far in conference play. But things don't get much better for the Aztecs on the court, where they've lost their last two games by a total of six points. That includes a buzzer-beater by the New Mexico State Aggies last week in which San Diego State's Trey Wetzel stole the ball from a Aggies player near the end of the game and raced the length of the court for a dunk that put the Aztecs up by four with two seconds left, the AP reports. ""It was a great feeling,"" Wetzel said after the game, per the San Diego Union-Tribune. ""It was just a matter of getting the win.""",0.14937759336099585,0.09128630705394192

And since this is the final episode of the Season. I'll also be sharing my reaction to season 1 as well as yours, too. I'm your host.Ingrid Nelson and last week on one step. I talked to Erica Anderson who is executive producer for Kara Swisher about her journey to recovery and sobriety. If you didn't get a chance to listen to that interview, make sure to go and check it out on this week's episode. I'm going to be reflecting on my conversation with Erica as well as the entire season as a whole let's get into last week's episode talking to Erica. And yes, Erica is my girlfriend in case you didn't know and it was really special having her here doing an episode of the podcast. I definitely had butterflies in my stomach and I feel like any time we're in a new situation together particularly if we're in a like professional environment and our paths cross. We just get especially starry-eyed with each other. So it was just sweet having her here too. We actually had a really Incredible conversation and I am so grateful that Erica chose this space to talk about her sobriety and Recovery because you know, I've known Erica now for over two years. So I've known that this is a part of her life, but it just felt really special that she came here into this space to talk about her experience and there were several things that really stuck out to me. I think the first thing that comes to mind for me is her view on her sobriety and recovery, and when I asked her, you know is recovery a forever thing for you. She really pulled it back to the present moment and was like, I'm focused on today and doing what I can today and not drinking today and I thought that was such a simple. And concise answer but it was also really profound to because you know, I've had multiple moments and just things happening in my life where I often will spin out into the future and I think you know having goals is a really great thing. But this goes beyond a goal. It's really Imagining the future in almost and obsessive way where it's pulling me out of the present. Aunt and I thought it was really wonderful that she reigned it in and was like, I'm only in control of what I do today. And today I am not going to drink so that I thought just made you know, I think longer term goals, whatever they are that made it more digestible for me thinking about it in the sense of what can I do today? That is in Fine with that goal and every day that's going to look slightly different and that's one of the reasons why I wanted to make this podcast because you know these big changes and shifts and Transformations that we go through in our lives often. We see the end result of that or something near the end result, but we don't really get to see those smaller steps and I think pulling it back to today makes us realize that every day we are. Are in a small step to our larger goals. Another thing that I thought about and Christina and I were actually just talking about this is how we often just have this like singular image of what an alcoholic looks like or an addict looks like and so much of that is informed through the media that we consume the movies that we watch the TV shows we watch as well. and typically what we're seeing is this rock bottom where a person is on the streets and they're totally alone and it looks like they have lost everything and that is a very singular image that we have been fed and not to say that that imagery isn't true and that isn't the reality for some people because it very much is is but I think when we only see a singular image of what something is it makes us think that oh, well, I'm not that so I can't possibly be going through the same thing and I tie this back to my queerness and how I always stuffed away my attraction towards women inside of me because Is I would see this very narrow image of what lesbians looked like and I thought well, I don't look like that or I don't act like that or I'm not living my life in that way like none of this is really relatable to me in any way whatsoever. So I can't possibly be a lesbian and I think that there's definitely a correlation here and I think that that can be really harmful when we don't see the different paths. In which these parts of ourselves can play out in various ways. And so I loved hearing Erica's story about, you know, putting down that beer at the concert and that was really liked her moment of okay. I think there's something going on here and then waking up that next morning in her Corner apartment in San Francisco and having another moment of enough this Where it ends for me that isn't the image that were used to seeing we're not used to seeing the like Sunny apartment. We're not thinking about the person having a really exciting and new and shiny and glamorous job to the outside world. And so in a lot of ways Erica's story is just so polar opposite to what we're used to and I think for me A just meeting Erica and knowing her it opened up a whole new world for me. When I say that everything that I had thought before was challenged and shattered. It is so true and it was shattered in the best way possible because it made my view of the world and the people in it so much more expansive and I think that is ultimately a beautiful thing. Like it gives me goosebumps to think about that and it came from meeting. One person. I also really really loved when Erica talked about her. Sobriety being the number one priority in her life because I think as women especially we are brought up to be caretakers for other people and we're often told and even encouraged to put our personal needs aside in order to please other people and the fact that Erica came in here and was like, you're not my Over one priority Ingrid. My sobriety is that is the number one spot for her. I have so much respect for that because she is putting her well-being first. And in this culture of self love and self care where we're seeing these words thrown around all the time and sometimes the things that are associated with those two phrases can be Superficial this felt like something so deeply personal and really on a higher plane of existence something that you know is beyond the realm of facemasks. It's something that is very much present in all of her daily experiences, and I thought that that was just so beautiful and it made me think about okay. Well I I may not be sober but what if I viewed my self care and self-love practice in a similar way. What would be the number one thing for me? And I actually don't know what that thing is. So this is actually a really great question for me to be asking myself and I'm going to be exploring this now probably for at least the next few days possibly weeks maybe even months. Who knows, but I'm really glad That this question came out of her response because now it's making me want to dig deeper and figure out what is that thing for me? What is the thing? That is the number one priority when it comes to myself care that isn't just about me but touches every single thing in my daily life. So that's my challenge. I've been challenged once again by Erica Anderson and I think the last thing that really stuck out to me is how remarkable it is that at 13 years old. She knew that she was going to have an unhealthy relationship with alcohol. Even if she didn't have the exact language for it. She didn't know exactly how it would play out. There was something inside of her that told her. Oh, yeah. This is a thing and again like I tie this back to You my queerness not saying that like my queerness is like a disease, but I think that there are so many things that our child selves are aware of like we know ourselves just instinctually an inherently on this deeper level because we haven't been fully inundated with the broader culture and all of the people in our lives yet. And we do have this acute awareness about ourselves. When were younger. ER and I often find that the older I get the more I keep revisiting that little girl inside of me and realizing. Oh my God, she was so right about so many things and I knew from a young age that I had an attraction towards girls. I didn't have language around it, but it was something that was just always kind of there and I think that you know, sometimes we can write off our younger. Elves and not take them seriously and think that they didn't know anything and I think that in some cases our younger selves actually know a lot and we can learn a lot from them. And I think that this example from Erica that really resonated for me, especially in this moment where I feel like I'm revisiting that little girl inside of me and I think it's also a place of healing to to go back and remember those moments. When I asked Erika, she immediately knew what age like the moment. I think we all have moments like that inside of us that we remember and when we get in touch with those moments, it might be initially painful, but when we learn to have compassion for what was happening when we are healing ourselves in on this journey of healing, I think that one of the biggest things that we can do is go back to our younger. Olives and thank them for the awareness that they had and the gifts that they have given us and to tap into that. Well of just awesomeness that we often forget about when we get older. So now let's move into reflecting on season 1 of the podcast in general. I just have to say right up front that this has been such a cool experience. It's definitely been a creative. Out of process there have been learning curves and it's just been really fulfilling and enriching overall. I've really enjoyed putting this podcast together thinking about what the episodes are going to be and reflecting on all of the episodes from this last season. I just feel like wow we did that. That's so cool. So let's go back to the very first two episodes. So I'm going to kind of do these And pears because we have like the interview episode and then the reflection episode. So the first episode was mommy issues followed by to be a mom or not to be and this was around my conversation with Angela garbs who wrote like a mother. I think that some people were initially surprised that I chose motherhood and Parenthood as the topic that I was entering into this podcast with but I think once people listen to the episode, Add the response to this episode was so incredible because it didn't matter where people stood in terms of their personal stance on whether or not they want to be a parent. There was something that they were pulling away from the conversation with Angela. You know, I think one of the coolest things that came out of the first two episodes is our first ever podcast club meeting of that we had at the wing in SoHo and it was a group of 10 people in one of the conference rooms. I was at the wing and it was just so incredible to be with people who had all listened to the podcast who were all there to talk about the first two episodes and I felt like our conversation just flowed and as someone who is an introvert one of the best parts for me was knowing that there were other introverts in the room, but everyone participated more than once and that felt like a real I'll Victory when you get the introverts in the room to participate not once but more than once I just thought that was so cool. And everybody had a completely different life experience to and it was so cool to hear how the different life experiences informed their perspective on parenting and whether or not they want to be a parent Angela's publisher Harper wave has also been really incredible to us. A gay bus books to give to everyone who came to the podcast club meeting which was such a wonderful gift. So everyone that came got a copy of Angela's book as well as a sugar in the city lip treatment, which is my collaboration with fresh. So it just felt like a really fun Gathering and as a part of this Gathering I also asked for feedback from the group of people there and Christina and I worked on this together. Sir, and some of the things that were requested during the podcast club meeting, you know wanting to hear stories that we don't typically here so topics that we may be familiar with but the individual story isn't something that were used to hearing and I think that that is 100% something I am interested in. I think the episode with Erica is a great example. All of that and I'm excited to see like what we can do more around this General themed episodes around friendship. We're also highly requested and spoiler alert. We are actually already working on this for season 2 and we have a guest confirmed and I'm really excited about who this guest is if you follow things that I'm reading Ben you might know who this person is, but if the topic is Friendship and there's a book on friendship that I've recently read and you know what it is. Then you'll know who the guest is, but I'm very very excited to talk to this person. And in terms of the podcast Club in general, we will be having two more meetings in New York City before the end of the year. So before everyone kind of breaks for the holidays, we will be planning to more podcast club meetings. So if you're interested in attending I We encourage you to sign up. We will be posting announcements on our Instagram, which is one step podcast. So that's definitely where you want to be checking to see when our next podcast club meeting will be happening. They're really fun. And it was just cool to see people show up. I mean, the number one fear is nobody's going to show up in the fact that everyone showed up. I was like, well, this is already a success everybody's here and now I'm just excited to continue. In you this because it really does feel like such a special space where we have the freedom to have these conversations that we may not have in our everyday lives moving into the episode with nittaku Chopra. One of my favorite people just ever she's such a light in this world and her episode was when your body betrays you and the reflection episode was sharing the thing you want to hide the most When I was talking to knit akka I remember her talking about sharing photos that she had had for 17 years and how she came to that decision and it wasn't this impulse decision because one she had been hiding the photos for 17 years. And so it was something that in a lot of ways she had been doing her own work around and I love how she brought up in the episode the things that we are Are trying to hide the most in us are usually the things that we've done the most work on like we formed an awareness around the shame that we might have and I just remember sitting there with her and having this brief moment of oh my gosh. I know what the thing I want to hide the most is what she's saying is so true. This is a thing that I have done so much work around if not the most. Amount of work around and oh my gosh is this going to happen and I just remember looking at netiquette because we were sitting across from each other this thing that I was hiding inside of me this story just felt so big and heavy and scary and hearing nittaku story and looking into her eyes. I had this moment of oh, I think it's going to be okay. I think it's going to be okay because Nitta has done this and I think it just has to do with netiq has presence to she made me feel like that was a possibility for me and I felt safe in that moment. Just even contemplating it for a second and all of this happened in a split second and then it went away and going into the reflection episode. I had been planning to talk about something else because obviously my brain came into play and was like, Let's not go there. You don't have to do this. Like it's not totally necessary the people who matter in your life, they all know this story about you like every excuse that I could think of was there. So I had actually planned to talk about something else and then as we started recording I was like, oh my gosh, I feel this story coming up inside of me and I can either deny it and push it down or I can let it come out as it. wants to come out clearly and my body was actually sending me that signal like this was a physical experience for me and I let it come out and that was another split-second decision where you know, I think about sometimes my life in terms of piggy banks and what I'm investing in and the piggy bank of integrity and honesty or the piggy bank of denial and lying and being Kind to myself ultimately and betraying myself. So when I thought about it in terms of those two piggy banks, I was like, where do I want to be investing this coin? And I chose the piggy bank of integrity and truth and courage and it was unexpected. So I didn't like have a script or anything laid out, but I told the story of how I lied about graduating from college and And it was scary. I couldn't believe that it was coming out when it was coming out. It was almost like I was having this out-of-body experience briefly where I was like my mouth is moving and I can't believe these things are coming out. But when I reflect on it now, you know, I realized that that really was the only choice and only path within my Integrity there were other options, of course, but they were either slightly out of my Integrity or way. Of my integrity and this was something that was looking to come out so much so that I felt it in my body and I'm really grateful that I paid attention to what my body was saying to me because since releasing it I have not felt that same feeling in my body because it's out of me and the conversations that I've had from people after posting that episode I was telling Christina. Ah this that I had gone into that week that the podcast was going to go up and I was a wreck blessed Christina because I was up and down like very up and down just like emotionally I would have days where I was like great. This is awesome. Like I'm living my truth and then other days where I'm like what the hell am I doing? And I think that's when you know that you're like in a vulnerable space when you're really just like toggling. Can forth before he like release it from yourself, but I told her that going into that week. I had just been having a conversation about miracles. So someone had presented this idea around Miracles and how Miracles are actually a small thing that can happen in our lives every day. And so I loved that idea and I remember asking for a miracle. That week and it wasn't a miracle of I'm hoping that people respond to it in this way because I knew that wasn't within my control and one thing that I try to practice is to not try to control outcomes, but to be present and what my actions are. So when I was asking for this miracle, I asked no matter what happens. Please help me to be drenched in love. What my miracle was I had to think about it for a second because I was like I need to get past like the response from other people. I need to get past these first few layers. What would truly be a miracle for me? And because I carried so much shame around this for so many years the miracle and the antidote to shame is love and the day that podcast went up and the days following I received text messages from people. people that I know and some that I don't know very well who just poured love into the messages and when I saw people they were so incredibly loving and kind and I was in awe that the miracle happened and the response from you as listeners has also reflected love and you know the letters that we I have received the messages people sharing their personal stories. Some people even experiencing almost the exact same thing with grief and lying and lying about a degree like to know that there was someone else out there who experienced basically the exact same thing. I thought to myself. Oh my God for all of these years. I thought that I was just completely alone in my Act Story and there's another person out there at least one other person who has felt this and has experienced this and I freed myself and I think that's my ultimate reflection. I feel like a different person after letting that go I feel like I have really stepped into who I meant to be right now. And who I meant to be right now is someone who is not ashamed of her past and her story. I For so long it was just ashamed of taking a different path in life and having a life that people around me didn't have whether it was having a sick parent growing up and no one around me having a sick parent or having a parent died when I was younger and I didn't know anyone else who was my age who had lost a parent and then you know, I was in abusive relationships. I was raped and I was going through A lot of shit. And so the fact that lying and creating a story in my head that seemed safe and predictable and comfortable like that makes sense to me that that would be my coping mechanism because I didn't reach for other things but we all have to reach for something. We all have coping mechanisms and moments of darkness and it's all going to look different for every single one of us and Is happened to be my coping mechanism. What I've realized now is that I haven't gotten a job because I've said that I have a degree, but actually my career path is a path that I kind of accidentally found that happened to not require a degree and I followed that path and I have let go of that coping mechanism. And I'm not afraid of my story anymore and that feels like a really really big deal to look at my past self with compassion and to know that there's so much healing that has happened and that I'm proud of myself. Like I couldn't imagine 10 years ago being in this place where I'm like telling the story I've gone to events think it was last week Christina and I were at an event and she was like in And sentence you mentioned money and dropping out of college and that was amazing to see and I was like, oh my God, I did do that and to just know that that's the place where I'm in now where I'm telling the truth about who I am and I'm going to continue on that path and I'm going to learn more about myself and just have more compassion for my past self. That makes me feel really Good about all the work that has led me to this point and I'm so grateful to have this space for the podcast because this could have come out in different ways. But the podcast felt like the space where it wanted to come out and I'm glad that I listened to that instinct. Okay. I made it through without crying. Thank God the last two episodes that I'll be reflecting on our money equals lots of feelings with Chelsea Fagan and Money that changed everything since talking to Chelsea we covered so much but the thing that has really stuck with me the most that I keep thinking about now months after talking to Chelsea is that when you don't own your story people start making assumptions and filling in the blanks for you. I think this especially applies to your financial story because we all make assumptions about About people whether it's based off of how they present themselves what they're buying what their job is and stepping into transparency around finances in the moments that matter with the people who matter I think is life shifting and I've gotten text messages from people that are like the next time I see you. I really want to talk about this more in person. Like I would really love to hear more from you. I want to share like what my experiences the This part about that is that ultimately it's people claiming their stories for themselves and taking back that narrative instead of letting other people fill in the blanks. And for a long time. I let other people fill in the blanks of my life for me whether it was what I was expected to do go to college have this job or after starting my career on the internet what I should and shouldn't be be doing what I should and shouldn't talk about and I'm just kind of done with that from childhood all the way up through my professional years. I have been told not to talk about money. I've been discouraged to talk about money publicly. And now I'm just like I will talk about money when I feel like I want to talk about it and it's the space that I want to do it in because I'm not ashamed of my story and I think At this episode with Chelsea and then the reflection episode really helped me to dig in deeper to what my financial story is and it's something that I'm still in process with and I'm still learning. I feel like every single day. I'm learning something new but it does feel really powerful to be in this place where I'm owning my financial story and I'm talking about it and I'm talking about it. It in professional spaces. I'm talking about it with my friends. My friends are sharing their stories with me. You guys are sharing your stories with us that just feels like a big freaking deal. Now. We're going to be moving into your Reflections. Here's what you had to say Ingrid. My name is Rachel and I'm from Michigan and I just finished your episode with Erica about her sobriety adventure and journey and how You doing in recovery and all of that and I wanted to say that the episode really resonated with me because last night I went to my very first Al-Anon meeting to kind of deal with my own mental health journey in regards to an alcoholic that I love dearly and that's in my life. And I'm on this kind of weird spiritual journey that also just culminated me realizing that I needed some help and attending Al-Anon and so I feel like it was some sort of almost like a divine intervention that But this is what your episode was about today. And I really appreciate breaking down the stigma around alcoholism and sobriety. I think it's really great. And I really enjoyed your podcast so far. I really can't wait to see what you have in season 2. Hey Ingrid. I honestly it connected with all of your podcast episodes so far, but this one has hit really close to home. It wasn't alcohol, but I had another addiction to drugs specifically marijuana. Sickly I have been using it since I was in my teens and when I finally came out as gay I kind of used it as a way to cope with how people were going to treat me and the anxiety and the fear that I had that everything would be different and worse. But luckily I met my beautiful girlfriend and you know, she finally said something to me and it wasn't that she was forcing me to quit whatsoever. And she also made that really Ali clear that if it was something that I wanted to do, you know that there needed to be a different way about going about it and actually doing it and I just kind of needed to hear that to see that I didn't need it and I don't want to do it so it's been a few months of me being sober and I haven't even wanted to try it again or felt the need to do it again. It was almost like a barrier between me and my girlfriend. And just any emotional connection we could ever feel it was like I had so many things happen, you know, just like personal issues that have happened throughout my life that I was just trying to hide and keep to myself. It just all started to boil over and I just wanted to use any kind of barrier I could so that I wouldn't have those emotions come out and now I'm definitely more emotional, but that also means that I can be closer to my Friend in our relationship and it also shows me that it's okay to be vulnerable and people still support you no matter what but yeah, I'm just excited for what the future holds for you. Bye. Hi Ingrid sober life is the very first podcast I've ever heard. I know I'm a bit late to the podcast party, but I am so glad I did and now that I'm here I'm here to stay. I had been debating sobriety. For a while after losing my dad. I felt that alcohol was the only way I could connect with him. It doesn't help the fact that he himself was an alcoholic. It was just a very complex way that I was trying to find some form of grieving or support to alcohol, even though I've had realizations about it. I just never had the courage to act. Actually act upon it and I can completely relate to Erica being scared of not being able to have a drink again. It's scary but it's been a week that I've been sober. I've made the decision to not drink anymore. Take care of myself. I'm trying to be more present. I've taken of meditation. I've been trying to make the change in my life. I'm trying to do it one step at a time. Time thank you so much for being a catalyst for that change that I've made. Thank you so much Ingrid and Erica. Hi Ingrid. So I just listened to your podcast about sharing the thing you want to hide most as well as the podcast on so sugar about your friendship with Carrie in both of these episodes. You talked about your relationship with the coping mechanism of lying and I just really really appreciate that. You spoke about that it made Me realize that I had been doing the same thing and I don't love that. I've been doing that. But I'm so grateful that I know about it now and can start the process of coming out of that and being my most authentic self. I also just want you to know that I love it. You're a queer woman of color that's talking about hard stuff and taking up such a wonderful space and doing everything that you're doing. So I would get lanky talking about the hard stuff and know that it's helping at least one clear girl out. Here you appreciate you time. Thanks. Hello. My name is Marissa and I'm calling from Ann Arbor Michigan. I just wanted to say that I really enjoyed the first season of the one-step podcast. I just wanted to know if next season occurs. You were going to focus on more queer people whether they're in literature or pop culture just because I know that being part of the LGBT community or self that is an angle that you take with a lot of your content and As a member of the LGBT community myself, I would really appreciate it. Thanks so much. Bye well, thank you so much for ISSA for calling in. We are definitely planning to make episodes that are more specifically lgbtq focused. I hope that you were able to listen to Erica's episode around her sobriety because we do talk about queerness and sobriety. This is a topic that is really important to me and I would love to do episodes that are more specifically focused on this topic, but I think one thing that has been really cool about this first season is, you know, the things that we are talking about because I am a mixed race queer woman the things that we're talking about the perspectives I'm sharing are coming through the lens of a queer experience and I feel really proud of myself for stepping into that space and really grateful to have this space and that makes me really excited to talk to other people about their experiences like having Erica here and talking about queerness and Recovery really like lit up this part of me where I was like who I want to have like more queer conversations with people so If any of you have suggestions for guests that you would love to hear on the show, definitely let us know. It could be an author that you really love or maybe you just have like a general topic. You would like to have covered. We are open for feedback here. Hi, I'm good. My name is Sandra Kosta and my favorite episode has been the one about finances. I thought it was very honest and and there are a lot of topics that I haven't heard another podcast about personal finances and all of that that I've heard here and also being part of the LGBT community. It was nice to hear about that as well. Anyway, keep up the good work, and I'm excited to do this. Hey Sandra, thank you so much for calling in. This voice mail has actually inspired me along with the previous one now. My wheels are turning and I'm thinking it would be really cool at some. Point in the future to do an episode that is specifically around queerness and money because that was something that Chelsea brought up during our talks together and I think it would be really cool to focus in on that because it really isn't something that I have heard a lot about at least not in like one designated spot. I've heard like little tidbits here and there and like personal experiences from people that I know and of course, I have my personal experiences, but I think it would be really cool to just make a full episode around this so TBD or maybe it's TBC actually to be continued. All right. So now we're going to be moving into questions that we have received in a written form and I'm bringing in Christina. Who is the producer here on one step and she's going to read the questions. And we're going to answer them together. I thought it would be cool to have you here Christina since you're literally always here sitting next to me. Hi everyone. This is Christina. So our first question and it was actually really appropriate because we wanted to talk about this anyway, but what will season to include so we've been thinking a lot about season two. We definitely have the Friendship episode planned since that was requested and I immediately knew who I wanted to talk to you. But what are some of the other things we've been discussing a lot of the feedback has been around hearing different paths. For example with Angela's episode hearing different paths to Motherhood other versions of what life can look like and I think that's something that's really interesting to me. So I'd love to have that on that podcast too. Yeah, I agree especially just around like Parenthood alone. There's literally like at least seven different episode idea. That could just stem off of that topic. We also want to have the community featured heavily in the episodes to we have really enjoyed having that interaction with you. So I would like it if you send the people that you want to be featured because that's a huge part of our process and making this happen. Yeah, definitely and it's really cool to to like hear voice notes and voicemails from people and to hear actual. All voices because you know, we're putting voice out there but to receive it back feels so special and personal it feels like when we called the person called us. That's so cool. Yeah, to be honest in the beginning. I was like am I gonna have to have my friends call and we have not done that just having your boys on the podcast. All of your voice has been really great. Oh my God. I'm just thinking about our friends would totally call into if we needed them to okay. So the next question is I want to see the setup of your recording just curious. Okay, so we have actually been recording mostly at the YouTube space in New York. They have a podcast Studio there. But today we are actually recording at the wing in Brooklyn. So after we're finished recording today, we'll take a photo and we'll post it. It on our Instagram account when this episode goes up. So then you can see what it looks like, but we're actually in a pretty cool room today. It's really cute. Yeah. See the next question is how much money are you making off these podcasts? We are actually in the red on the vodcast because we haven't had any ads running this first season, and we also decided to go in a route where we're not tied to a network. So we fully owned everything and if you're not familiar with like how podcast Work networks are basically groups of podcasts and often one of the most valuable things about being in a network is that your cross promoted in other podcasts and that gives you more visibility. It usually provide connections with advertisers and facilitate those relationships, but we didn't take that route. You know, I remember talking about this with Christina and I was saying, you know, this is our chance to really figure out what this podcast is to play with it and then we can work with advertisers in future Seasons, but I think it's actually been really cool having the first season ad-free. We're hoping that in the future we will become profitable but this was something that I was definitely willing to invest in and so I have put my own money into this to support the podcast and also just for transparency when we Court at the YouTube space that space is free for creators that have 10,000 subscribers or more and I happen to live in New York. So it's within super close proximity. It's really convenient to use their space there. And then today at the wing we had to pay for the recording space and also the equipment and then we also have tongue here who is our amazing audio engineer and we pay her to so So that's kind of a look into what's happening in terms of the expenses for the podcast. The next question is what's the most difficult thing to do about the entire podcast? I'm gonna let you answer this one first Christina because I feel like you this is your first time doing anything podcast related, right? So I'd say there are a lot of steps that go into making a podcast that may not be immediately obvious like working with the sound and Here and finding a host for our RSS feed and making sure that every episode makes it all the different platforms so that you can hear it and securing all the amazing guests and I have a lot of experience creating content online, but I've never worked on a podcast before so everything that I'm doing. I'm doing it for the first time. So I would say that for me the most difficult thing is not beating myself up because Cuz I want it to be really really good and I think Ingrid deserves that I think this community deserves that and so I have really high expectations. But I'm also trying to show myself some Grace to but I really do hope that you love the podcast. Well, I think you're doing an incredible job. I have been saying to people that I know how really incredible it has been for me to see you step into this space and just Figure it out. And when I listen to the episodes when we're going through the editing process, I am just so impressed with how you have stepped into it. And I think you're doing an amazing job. So you deserve the grace, but you also deserve a lot of praise to because you I mean this first season is even better than I had imagined it. Thank you. Yeah you and the last question is do you regret sharing any of your vote? Honorable moments. How do you keep life and work separate? Well, I've been on the internet for ten years now. So if I said I didn't have any regrets that would be a lie, because I think any of us who have been on the internet just in general. We definitely I mean just scroll back to your old Instagram photos, and I'm sure you can find some things there. But yeah, I definitely have small. I can't think of like the smaller ones right off the top of my head right now, but just in general like a bigger regret that I have is sharing intimate and personal life moments that I wouldn't share now today. And so I think that's ultimately the thing about regrets. They are things that we recognize in this point in time. he would not do and that's why it's a regret if we regret something we've obviously done a lot of learning to get to that point and for me one of the most important things in my life are my relationships with my friends and also my romantic relationship with Erica my relationship with my mom my relationships in general are really big deal to me and what I've learned over the years is that it's often the smaller moments that That you typically won't see on camera or like in an Instagram photo or like hear me talking about those are the moments that I really cherish the most and I did go through a phase, especially in my early years of just being on the internet and on YouTube where I didn't have any boundaries and I had to figure out what my boundaries were by crossing over them. And then I started realizing. Oh that doesn't actually feel good. To share that that actually feels like something I want to keep as a part of my private experience and so over time I've learned what feels good for me and what feels like I'm betraying a personal aspect of my life. And I think we all especially now that pretty much everyone is on social media and is connected to the internet. We all owe it to ourselves to To have a personal life and when I go into sharing moments of my life and my experience or even having Erica on this podcast, there are conversations that happen if I'm sharing something about myself. I talked about it with myself. I write about it. I know why I'm there to share it and my deeper intentions behind it. If someone else is involved, we have like multiple conversations we talk about what Boundaries are what we will and won't talk about and I think ultimately that's just given me a lot more. Peace and it's interesting how setting boundaries where it's some people I think confused boundaries with like putting up a wall and shutting people out. I've actually noticed that setting boundaries in my life has allowed me to go deeper into my story and my experience is where I'm actually sharing more meaningful and information when I want to share it and that's what feels good for me. I'm living authentically through my work and I'm living authentically through my personal and private experience as well. Alright, everyone that is going to be it for season one. We're going to wrap it up right here. Thank you so much to everyone who is listening and who has listened to this first season. It has been an absolute.

So when Swisher asked her to talk about her experience on the show, she jumped at the chance. ""I've known Erica now for over two years. So I've known that this is a part of her life, but it just felt really special that she came here into this space to talk about her experience and there were several things that really stuck out to me,""grid Nelson, the show's host, tells Cosmopolitan. ""She really pulled it back to the present moment and was like, 'I'm focused on today and doing what I can today and not drinking today, and I thought that was such a simple.' And concise answer but it was also really profound to because you know, I've had multiple moments and just things happening in my life where I often will spin out into the future and I think you know having goals is a really great thing. But this goes beyond a goal. It's really Imagining the future in almost and obsessive way where it's pulling me out of the present,"" Anderson says. "" Aunt and I thought",0.1875,0.08125

Lgbtq, related hints and tips that we find good to discuss about. I'm Anna and I'm from the real massage, which is an lgbtq massage service in Brighton, and I'm George a lgbtq focused personal trainer also based in Britain. And this is our first ever episode of this well podcast. So because it's the first time please go easy yet. We're vegetarians. So go slow. So over the next few weeks and we're going to be discussing topics, which we feel the lgbtq community would like to be listening to and could benefit from hearing about such as self-care trauma addiction alcohol abuse depression mental health anxiety. Yeah, and crucially what we want to do is we want to talk about our own experiences with with those things and how we got through them to the other side to where we are now. Yeah, basically our paths crossed. Business and then we discovered that we both actually been through quite a lot of shit and come out the other side. So when we picked it apart, so actually there's quite a quite a lot that we could discuss and potentially help others with going forward. Yeah, and I think what's really important to say there is that when our paths crossed we were both in this really really great happy place and it feels like when you're in that space it's really important to give back to the community and to share thoughts and ideas. Diaz yeah, I mean particularly lgbtq community that there's a lot of talk about what we've been through and or suppression and the bad things and that's very necessary. But actually there's not a great deal of material about talking people talking about how they've got through it. And now that they're thriving yes, there is light at the end of the tunnel. Yeah, and sometimes all you see a reference to those people say it gets better. But what does it look like and how do you do it? Yeah, we're both. Well, we discovered that we're both lucky to be in positions of privilege because we feel happy right now and I just want to share that. I just want to help other people learn techniques and learn how to be happy and their best selves actually. No, I mean babes I do and part of that means sharing our stories The Good the Bad and the Ugly the very ugly the monkey the total month and absolutely so collectively George and I have both been through some really serious shit and fucking our history is like George. I think it's fair to say you had a bit of an issue with drugs a little bit and I don't think there's anything by a shepherd of double it up, you know, actually I have And other item there is a write up her nose at various points. Obviously alcohol issues for both of us. And what about you Anna? What else do we got? Well, we got bit of Developmental trauma PTSD, so and we both kind of struggle with our bodies. Absolutely and that's what led to our paths Crossing in the first place struggling with queer identity and Body Image. Yeah. Yeah. So George, let's talk a little bit more about your struggle. And what went down there for you. Okay, I mean I struggle with anxiety and depression. I wasn't an anxious kid. Not that I remember but I think I developed into anxiety as a teenager and what I think is even though even now it's more accepting to come out but I don't care how much it's accepted it still really hard for you to understand what's going on. In your head and I think that was part of something that made me anxious like what the hell is going on? Why do I have feelings for this person? Did I mean and even though that was like 15 years ago, so it was harder to come out at that point. I just think I really struggled with that so that probably contributed to my anxiety and depression then that kind of intertwines with drugs and alcohol doesn't it's like a form of escapism. I've had a bit of a dealing with suicide which I'd like to pick apart in another podcast. But yeah some stuff some stuff. What about you? So I grew up in a really rural Scottish community and I didn't know what gay was and I think when you're growing and you're slowly realizing there's something different like the Disney movies don't really apply to you. You can't ever really see yourself with a man. If you don't know what gay is it's like you grow with no sense of self and I can remember being at school and looking back. I think this is my first ever interaction with someone. He was gay though. I didn't know it at the time. I had a PE teacher who is like as far as like what your view is birch. Oh my God. I had a standard isn't it have absolute idiots like to have a bitch PE teacher and I remember a lot of the the mums and dads would talk about her and there was just this General vibe that whatever she was was not okay, you've got to picture this. This is like a rural Scottish farming community in the 1990s. Okay. It's Very Wicked man. Yeah, so we're making little straw dollies for the Harvest Festival. Okay, and we have this Harvest show at everyone from the community gets invited to come see us perform a higher show in the church Hall and incomes my PE teacher and she is legit wearing a suit with a tie in brokes good for her. I bet she rocked it. She did but you couldn't hear that. She was rocking it for all the deafening silence in the room because everyone just went quiet. I remember knowing like whatever she's just done is not. Okay, and then in the car ride home, I was just very aware that. Everyone else in the car, like other kids are their parents. It was not okay. Hmm, and I think maybe somewhere in me. Subliminally. I knew she was gay like maybe it was like little baby gaydar was just starting to take tentative flight. I knew that my teacher was was a lesbian, right and I learned that it's not okay that that wasn't. Okay. Yeah, so that was kind of like my first interaction with being gay. So I learnt the wherever I was that wasn't to be that yeah. Want to be gay and that led to like a lot of really really vulnerable stuff about doing anything to feel accepted and to make people believe I was straight and that lends a lot of Rudy trauma for me. Mmm. So then how did that come about like, what does that turn to in terms of alcohol? And/or? You know, I think as I got older obviously when you're younger how you suppress your identity is very different to how you do it is as a young adult and I think as I go into my adolescent and young adult years I started By doing a lot of shopping lot of spending money buying clothes. I supposed to make myself look like what I thought a straight person was. Hmm and I started drinking alcohol to make myself feel comfortable in straight situations that deep down. I didn't want to be in because I was gay. Yeah food babes Technics. Yeah. So one of the harder things is understanding what's happening, even though you're young and you feel like there's something different about you. You don't know what it is and the penny isn't dropping just yet. If that makes sense. Just this niggling feeling something's off that you're different. Yeah. Yeah, like for me. Do you remember when Tipping the Velvet came on TV? Oh my God. I love Tiffany of those unite are like your 31 and I'm 30, so I would have been like 14:15 right about that age when it came on the TV and I could just remember being like what the actual fuck is this? Oh my God, I gotta wow. I have a bit of an embarrassing story want it but you go first I watch Tiffany over I was at my grandma's house and she was like, oh there's this new period drama and I really want to watch it and I'll say okay. Yeah love a period drama sitting in the lounge watching Tipping the Velvet with my grandma. I was absolutely mortified. It's and then there was obviously lesbian sex scenes and I was like Pride and Prejudice. It was not right and I could sense how awkward she fell and at the same time I had such Roseate but my face was so red obvious because I was obviously excited and confused and sat with my Grandma at the same time. I'll holy ball bag. This is horrendous. So yeah, that was my first experience of Tipping the Velvet. Did you like it though? I loved And then I went home and obviously watched it on my own and just thought this is what is a family show. Like wow. I was like why am I so connected to this almost but because I was 14 15, I'd already started to think. Yeah, I like girls, but that really hit home for me being on TV and it being from years ago. Like I think I was at eighteen hundreds or something. Yeah. So this is a real thing. Yeah, and it was a real thing. Yeah, toe. And I think for me like I was in the same position that like I was starting to think maybe I liked girls because you know how it goes like you start getting like really weird crushes on just like women on the TV. Yeah, and you can't work out if like you want to be the best friend or do you want to let it show go get really confused and that you're going for let the Freeman's catalog and you're like do I like what you're wearing or do I just like yeah. Yeah. Do I want to wear that or do I want to look at you? I was going through that and you've got imagine this like there's a little suppressed pathway in my head. That's like Girls Girls Girls Girls Girls Girls Girls Girls good. Yeah, exactly. Yeah is it mostly greens are so I think yeah. It's like a Motley Crew playlist my head 24/7 at this point little 14 year old me and suddenly Tipping the Velvet comes on and it's like that little pathway just gets like blown to fucking Smithereens because suddenly I'm like, oh my God. Oh God. I'm only a Victorian lesbian what's going on in my annoys to go? Like if I'm just a nice to go? Yeah, and I got so into the actress to play Nan Rachel study that in English class and I don't know what the fuck to my English teacher thought was going on, but we had to write some creative writing. So I wrote a Rachel Sterling fan fiction when I got two kids Rachel stirred egg. And can you believe I handed that it took for marketing? Like here's this is my he's my biggest sexual fantasies for Utah. That's a mark. What grade did you get? Probably you probably liked going there for probably got like a fucking letter to the council my very first crush girl crush. I remember I was 14 15 and Tipping the Velvet came out. But the first one where I remember thinking. Oh God, what is this? I'm feeling was do. Of the my parents alien. Try to say what you were feeling. Mmm was gay. That was the feeling of okay, but do you remember the show? My parents aliens? Yeah. Oh my God, so I can't remember how old I must have been when I was watching. That was younger than that. I'm just maybe 10 or 11 and Mel the oldest sister. So there's three of them. I want to remember their names Mel Josh and it was the other one the little girl think the smart girl. Anyway, that's it. Smart-arse. Yeah. Is that Mel was like this teenage angsty. Like I just thought she was the coolest thing. I fancied her so much. She had all this makeup and piercings and just choose. Yeah, and I was like man, I dig that and I was like, but what do I dig what's going on is the hair clips. Nice it the girl. Yeah. That was my very first lesbian Crush that I remember. Yeah. Yeah, but actually just on a side note. He quickly I do remember watching Lucy Liu and Calista Flockhart kissing and Ally McBeal when I was about 7 and remember my sister saying oh that's really gross. And I remember thinking is it that's so like yeah dig that too and that I was really young when I watch that. So yeah, so I know what do you feel like those experiences taught us as we were growing up? I think it taught us that we couldn't be our authentic selves and the we learned that being gay was a source of Shame and as we've suppressed that that's led to some of the difficult stuff. We ended up going through later in life. Yeah. I think that's a very good way of putting it. If you can't live your authentic self, you're not going to truly happy in my opinion and that's what this is all about. So that brings us to the end of the first ever episode of this world the introductory episode. There's next time we're going to be talking about alcohol and drug addiction in the lgbtq community and how not to be a hot mess and how not to end up in hospital or how maybe you have been a hot mess or R1 currently, but, you know, you can get through that you can just be hot and days, so we're gonna sign off now, so bye guys later. How do you think that like do you think Rachel Sterling is going to sue us? Wow, I don't think I don't think we even need a hit baby. Okay, I was kind of like it if she did do so when you're into I'm just a nice to go for whitstable Dunstable whitstable. Don't support unstable. Where is Dunstable? I don't know.","– Anna Diaz says she and her partner were ""through quite a lot of shit"" before coming out to each other, and now they're speaking out about it publicly for the first time.

Herds is back going on everybody jump over here with Adam Kaplan and a lots to get into today. We've got another quarterback injury for the birds. We've got some players to evaluate from the preseason opener. And of course, it wouldn't be an eagles training camp without an in Camp Trade right Adam. Yes. Yes. The Eagles did make a trade for Eli Harold they cut or they traded Ryan Bates who probably would have been the first cut if they had to get down to 75 Jeff. So right I'm he was an undrafted free agent. Anyway out of Penn State who just did not Do anything and they were hoping if he would have performed you could been a practice squad player, but nevertheless Lots going on here. You know, I'm in Jacksonville Jeff as we speak here. That's right, Jack. The Jaguars have 15 players are unable to practice. So the Eagles were not the only team that's going through injury issues man. Well, let's talk about the big one because I think there's Widespread Panic All Over the Delaware Valley with Nate's unfilled having a left wrist fracture. And then what did the Eagles do from here? And you've heard all the you know, the the names out there and McCown Colin Pretty cool my God, they have to sign somebody now they came to into the season with Club with with Andrew coated cast. No Trudy Kessler Kessler. I'm getting confused with Andrew Kessler. I think is Agent, but correct and they're not related and they're not related. Right? Right. Let's all shout out to Andrew there. But uh, yeah. No Cody Kessler as the number two guy. I think the big thing we all have to do is kind of just collectively take a sigh or a breath of fresh air here. They've got still about two weeks of training camp to go and if this is only a six to eight-week injury is probably not going to be that big of an issue this maybe even being non issue at all Adam. Yeah, so he should be back with twins weeks three and five with with wrist fractures as long as our and there are no complications, especially because it's it's son Felts non-throwing wrist. It's his left wrist. I mean, it wouldn't ship would not surprise me if he comes back within that the fact if it really heals well, maybe throws lightly or will they let him throw because it's not Is Right risk may be the 11th start throwing a week 5 who knows but decision was made that they were in a not going to put on any reserve list is he was going to come back fairly early and that's really the reason why they're not going to sign a quarterback. Why would you why would you sign a veteran and by the way if the guys on if he's not plaid for termination pay he could you're going to guarantee his contract for beyond the the Roth week one roster. He so why start a veteran like Brock Osweiler or any of those journeyman? Why not just go someone has been with the team the whole offseason. Now you Cody Kessler you and I have talked about me doesn't throw the ball very, well. He's not real big physically 6 1 2 tenths of an inch moves. Okay, but thing is he knows their offense will execute it. Well Clayton Forrester does not ready. He didn't abominable game personal Source Who watch the tape said look like the moon was too big for him. Like he just was not ready mentally for it. The hope is Jeff and in the second game. He gets all the Jitters he was Clearly nervous there. He was tight. You could say whatever you want and saying it shouldn't happen. But he was he's a rookie right first NFL game. He struggled mightily. He was let's call it. He was terrible. Yeah. No, no doubt about it. We weren't expecting that. Yeah. Well, we'll talk about that a little bit. But obviously the accuracy you would think was the the in accuracy was because he was a little bit jittery out there. So we'll have to if you can I guess in some sensors at least there's a reason for it and it's not just that maybe he's a Louisville quarterback and it was terrible evaluation, right? So what we will get it to him a little bit. I guess the only argument to be made that I've heard that makes a little sense is that you want if you're gonna not if you don't want Kessler to be your top back up and maybe your quarterback who if Carson Wentz for to get hurt signing someone now lets you get into camp and gives you a two or three weeks to get a familiar with the offense or anything like that. But I look at it and say if they're going to sign a quarterback, it's going to be somebody who's probably familiar with their offense and it may be even some Is caught you know, maybe gets cut closer to cut down day or at cut down to anyway, so I understand what people are saying, but I still think it's a little bit like a too much of a five-alarm fire right now. Yeah and Josh Johnson wasn't that I had mentioned on Twitter that that's probably something that could have looked at be some of the Lions and he does have he does know the West Coast terminology because he played in with teams that guys played every offense. Yeah, exactly exactly. That's exactly it, but they decided not to be passed on. Him, I'm told so Doug at his word was was corrected want to go with these guys and week to the preseason. You could expect who's got to split the snaps. What kind of evaluation in you talking to your people did son fell get before he left with an injury. He obviously had the really nice bum to Mark em, Michelle. Yes, he played well, but he did miss a couple throws early fact the past behind goddard's back. I mean he did he throw to the wrong shoulder was behind ghadir. Yeah. There was wondering Over the middle, right? He just a little bit too strong, but after that he really he was very accurate overall. He was good. Now the the the 40 yard pass and then the the the 35 yard run by Michelle that pass was a touch pass. Now if you've seen a subfield fro, he's got a power arm very good on very big arm. Yeah, ten times bigger than Kessler's I mean, it's just he's got a good arm. He's got good size. Yeah, the promise of felt is an talk about this. He needs the raps. I mean, he's a guy that very inconsistent in Camp and we're putting it mildly right he needed these last three weeks of reps and unfortunately, he's not going to get them. I think that's that's a concern because if someone has to play this season, he'll have missed out on at least three weeks of work of putting work and training camp and preseason. Yeah. It's kind of fun. It's a little bit of how Nick Foles, you know, missed a lot of that time in 2017. Everybody was worried about how it was gonna play the elbow. The Super Bowl so it'll be interesting to kind of see with all this Miss time what that does for son felt. I agree. He is the type of guy who probably needs as many reps as you can get obviously not unlike Nick. He's not been a starter somewhere. So it's just not like riding a bike for him. So this will be a little bit of a setback for him and we'll just see how long it takes. But you bring up kind of when we talk about the quarterbacks and injuries. They're almost indirectly related in that lane. Johnson is now going to be out for a little bit and It raises the question. Will do you play Carson Wentz now with one of his best protectors who's going to be out for a little bit? Yes. Oh Jeff Lane soccer play the in the preseason. I'm told not going to be an issue for Week 1 I can he stay Eagles will actually put out an injury report. How about that? They about that I could say they had so many and good for the pr staff to do this. Really I'm glad that they did that for us her sacrum and staff deserves credit because I know that dogs been reluctant to do it, but you know what this does is this Not going to ask any questions if you just put it out there. This is what doug did your one no more questions. You could just get into football. So those actually smart move. Yeah. So let's the dress just quickly to me. You don't put Anna and and I know that Jordan Jordan my lot of played really well in the this preseason game. I'm very surprised because remember the tides came in with a lot of defensive starters in the lineup. I was actually with the Titans on Saturday. They review their tape they were really happy with their their first units that At the start is at play there very happy but enjoyed my lot of he definitely played. Well, there's no question based on my sources who watch the tape. However, are you going to really put him out there to be their starting right tackle in let's say the third week of the preseason want to really mean something really he's probably gonna he's gonna be out there for a quarter or a half. I that to me is very risky, but and they don't want to move on dreidel or to right tackle that it has. Well as he played in the opener. They are married to the idea that you have practicing and left tackle. So it does leave them kind of in a situation. To figure out. Well, how much are we going to play cards and whines if at all if he's not even going to have Lain Johnson out there and maybe not even Jason Peters out there because Peters doesn't really play that much in the preseason. So do you think that we won't see Carson Wentz I haven't asked yet, but I just know that dealing with teams over the years that are very reluctant to play with backup tackles and really backup players with the starting unit. They just team coaches don't like doing that because a risky be definitely worked a lot together because they're getting they're going to get Work in practice and training camp there the it to a certain extent. I mean, they're not going to get very many with the first team. But here's the other thing with Brandon Brooks not ready at though. I'm told he's getting very close. That's great. So, yeah, but again, we don't know it's not decided when he'll start practicing it. I have not been able to get that exactly exactly. I'm sure I know more than sweet but think about it now. So if I tie is the Right Guard now if Brandon had been coming back in the next two weeks, then you could consider just Putting big V left tackle because he's done it before she's been right up. Right - yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Well, we'll have to see I mean you want guys to get reps. They that I always I say the preseason is is important from knocking rust. I think it's hard to go play an NFL game at that speed when you've played 0 preseason snap. Some people say it doesn't matter at all and I would disagree with that. I think you know, it's anytime you do something at the pace of an NFL game in the speed that Anything that can prepare you for it, even if it's just a little bit is better than nothing now granted some quarterbacks. You just don't want to take that risk and I get it but in general, I think I think it's important to play some like you'll see like on Sports Talk Radio should players have preseason just pieces of matter word should every all the starters not play the first teams that you know starts and I say, I think you got it. It's important. It's not completely dismissible. Yeah. You look go. Back to Donovan McNabb and I I'll never forget this and I still to this day never got an explanation any re put it Donovan. I might have been the year after that. He keep he broke his ankle was a sewer towards a see. I don't remember what year it was. But what would have been probably the ACLU because I was a season Ender he I'm not joking. I think he played him for one snap and took him out something like yeah, it's ridiculous some like what know why even put them out there. What's the yeah one snap doesn't do anything. Please tell me won't one good series as soon as we get the good series of could be the first and they're all out. Yeah, that would be fine to me. But I would rather the starters be in there. You really have to be careful right of playing guys who have not gotten any work with the first team reps or very little that that's a problem. Sure. Let's move on to some player valuations because you obviously spent some time talking to some people and you have some really, you know, I think to the naked eye you and I anybody watching can say hey Audrey Diller play well or this person, you know Market until quite a nice pass, but give me something Insider e that stood out in your conversations, I will start with the offensive line of the big stories Andre Dillard you and I talked in the offseason. We are concerned that the lack of functional strength he was way behind in hand usage because this is all new to him client went three point stance and bright light is gone on the last two weeks, which we've outlined on our show and this game his athleticism and he's footwork and his movement were Auto flew away. Yeah, so really naturally fluid Apparently the scouts that I talked to her at the Senior Bowl were blown away by them, but they did all say to me. Look. He's not the strongest guy. He needs to be in the weight room for your hopefully you won't have to play and I will see the Eagles are hoping that Peters plays all 16 games and he's a year over well over a year from removed from the ACL. So he looks good, by the way, I mean not that he's playing right now, but he's had a very good camp, but getting back to dealer looks look the part didn't ask him to a lot in the Run game, but he's getting the footwork down. And the Hand usage in technique or where they where it needs to be and it was not the case in OT as where he struggled mightily and I've kind of learned my lesson the hard way not to to over evaluate OTAs, especially with players are being asked to do things. They've never done before because he's he's at this level you're going to run the ball a lot more. You know, right College show. Yeah. He looked he looked exceptional. I few hundred. Oh I and I hope as the preseason goes on a little a bit that we see some more intentional just power type run just just to get get a glimpse of how he does when he's got, you know, two hands on the ground and when going right now that you know, a maybe a like a seven techniques and were lined up right across from him, you know some power football or even even Zone run where he's uncovered a maybe launches into the second level to get on Allah line back. I want to see that kind of athleticism transform. I want to see a parlance of the running game of because I already we already knew about the past Pro that we figured that was going to Area even though he struggled early in Camp that he would naturally catch up to well speaking of catching up Jordan. My lot of the big issue with him is going from the left to the right side. He didn't take to it real well on the start training camp. He was probably if we graded them if we were able to get people to tell us who's probably of the eleven who are going to make the team 10 or 11. He was probably one of the lowest greater ones along with Matt prior, but he is really taken to the techniques better and it all showed up in this game. He had by the way in this game. He had not shown this before this kind of Competency. You know, I don't have an explanation for it just happened. This is what he did last year. He really came alive during the games. Yeah. This is I was talking to someone the Jaguars today who is a Personnel department. They were you know, they like many Tommy he's the one guy says look when you talk about a rugby player. It's you don't know what you're getting because it's yes it's a physical game, but you're not blocking the way that you block and Rugby's completely different here. Yes, you have to use your body in your arms, but the technique is completely different and then when you from a metal stick and point Jeff when you asked him go from the left to the right side, that's another position. You gotta learn like this kid. This kid is incorrect 23 years old. Are you see? I mean, I think he's got everybody can't It's about his capacity and potential and and what he can do if he has to play or when he'll play just amazing six-foot amazing. All right body fat unbelievable it so how about Lyme bags out of anything the linebackers. I thought to me to my naked eye Singleton seem to stand out as far as being around the ball be active, you know making plays from sideline to sideline. Yeah exact Brown was tremendous in the Run game to people who greeted tape so that he was exactly what they were hoping for a downhill. Run stopper Nick Gary really good in coverage executes well in coverage when he has to do it for some good some could be better look right now as I've said from day one after the after the combo grugier-hill injury, which is going to keep him out. Why as we know for a bit? Will you really look at this thing? They've got four linebackers that could really use right now if the season started today and and you know kimono you just hope that with You know a great a Grade Three MCL could be as many as 10 weeks. I mean, it's typically it's typically between six and eight. It's the injury that Evan Mathis had Evan Evan told me years ago. He was in tremendous pain when he came back, but he you know, he graded it and toughed it out. So they're going to miss Camus a minimum of the first couple weeks. I would say probably least the first three weeks and Gary's going to have a pretty big part because he can cover and he can execute that part but against the Run He almost has no chance because he's so small. Right, right. All right, anyone else stand out in your convert? Yeah. Yeah, the result Douglas was pretty much graded out perfectly whenever he was thrown to he had the receiver guarded like he with his luck with his lens. Mmm, as I said before. I know Darby's bat doing more than he was but couple weeks ago. It's going to take the only way that Dart the that that rissoles not starting is if they give somebody a starting job without our knowing it. I mean Douglas I've come around on them with first year was not very good last year when he was supposed to be the fifth corner. He had a start as we know he came on a little bit as we discussed last year on our show and now he's been their best cornerback in training camp. Maddox obviously is very very good. And yeah, it's his chance, but we're still Douglas you can make the argument if you talk to the right people. Been their best player in the offseason. We're going to have to take offence on defense deeper dive into the whole Corner situation. Maybe not next week, maybe two more weeks when this thing really starts to around into form because we have to still see how Sydney plays and Avante place because all season in leading up to Camp you and I discussed will what happens if Sydney Jones are Avante. Maddox is better. What do you do with Jaylin bills? And we didn't. Yeah, we did not talk about rasul Douglas. We also assumed and I don't think we're full. So that at some point in time this was gonna be back but now it's looking like it could be longer and even with Darby who's just now starting to practice a little bit, you know, yeah, maybe rasul Douglas starts because a he's earned it and because two guys who you have thought we're going to start aren't even going to be healthy enough to play. So there's a lot to the process there. We just have to let some weeks go by and see as others get healthy what happens exactly, right? And then Josh sweat very very good. I need to mention because he's been our guy for luxurious doing a half months. He put it together very good technique. He went against Taylor the one who had to play because he's suspended four games to they're trying to get him time. Right and I guess the functional strength part of it is about three times better than I was last time this year. He was a little bit I want to say thin but he was not filled out like he is now and just 15 pounds of muscle looks terrific. His technique is really good. He's knows what he's doing. They shot Hall was the surprise though. He had really been a disappointment for the Eagles. Yeah. He really lived up. I was always smoke. He was shot out of a cannon. I mean that's that's what this come from. Maybe you guys are feeling the urgency. Now Joe, you know, well, I think you know, whenever you start to practice or play against people who are not your own teammates after two weeks. You just get it rekindle something in you I guys talking about that all the time they just and we'll see you in a week or so when when they do the joint practices with the Ravens. They any time you watch a joint practice and you know Adam that there's just so much more intensity and urgency out there on the field when it's somebody other than your teammate that you've been hitting her not even allowed to hit really hard for Two weeks, you know, right which and then see if there's anyone else had defense. Not really. I do want to mention on offense a couple guys that I thought help them will not help this us before Dallas got it got hurt. You should have for captured by the way the same one. It's just you. He not the exact Earth can't do this stuff. But Goddard is so big physically. It's a very huge safety cannot cover me. You're not going to do that. You're going to have to get it. Corner or linebacker on immunity too damn big and it's got to be a corner as long like Russel Douglas. So he's going to be a major factor and we do want to mention the other guys Mark and Michelle who yeah, if you're a great if you're grading 90 players, he's in terms of training camp performance and plus this one game. He's in the top 20. Well, that's something and I mean, this is so nice older brother mean he's bounced around a little bit. This is this is there's room in a great story. This is a great there's room we've talked about how there's room to make this team as a fifth and maybe six receiver depending if they want to do that and go heavy there. But certainly he's a guy who with that speed and the ability to Parlay it into special teams as well as anything. He might do for the offense that that's that's a that's you know, you look at all the receivers the Eagles have kind of battling for these spots. Some are big strong guys like a Charles Johnson who's also fast, but some are like Braxton Miller were great warriors. Or they're kind of these versatile slot guys, but Michelle has this that probably the best speed out of all of them. So that might give him a leg up here everything they've asked him to do. He's done it. He's answered the bell every single time. You know, Matt Collins bat is backed by the way fully knock on wood bar. Yeah, I was gonna say not to do it back. Yes. Oh look. This I know score wasn't ideal. But look this Titans played a lot of starters Eagles basically didn't play any you know, it really just rested just about everybody so we'll see what they do in week two, but nevertheless there's there were some good stories here that don't let the score full either a lot of good stories in this game. Yes real quick before we wrap this up. I want them to talk about the trade. We mentioned it a little bit trading Eli Harold for Ryan Bates. Bates will have an opportunity to make the bills if you can they have all sorts of offenses. Mine injuries, but Eli Harold is do you see him as can't body or because he's been in the league and was what like a third-round pick several years ago has maybe a little bit of a I don't say a leg up but has maybe a better than average chance of Ghana pilfering that job away from so I would think that it's still just sweat type of job to lose and it is for Eli Harold to win. Yes. Oh, so I talked to coaching Source who work with them and one of us stops and said that when he came in, He was strictly going to be looked at as a 34 outside linebacker Chris. He's long. He's 6 foot 3 3333 in charms, really really struggled with technique. He was very raw. He he clearly was just an athlete coming out of college. I'm pretty by the way a very high character kit good kid, but we so raw and never performed for the Niners. He played DN and strong side linebacker for the Lions. This coaching Soros said that So if you're going to play mat end, he's probably going to need to get a Little Bit Stronger because he's somewhere up to 45 it 6-3, which is a little bit light. Maybe maybe it's is outside linebacker more like it. He's got an outside linebackers body, but he did play he played with his hand out in college at UVA. So he's he's gonna have a chance here. He was a guy that was I don't see was overdrafted because he was supposed to go in the second or third round and he went in the third so he'll have a chance. Look Sharif Miller, although he had a Really nice place in this game. He's a long ways away from ever. He won't play the season at all if he's on the roster, which you should be. He probably won't dress to see metabolic. He's there. He's been on like a teens. He's 30 years old and we mentioned Hall, you know of any Curry of course and Josh wet. So they're going to just throw competition should just some enough for with Eli Harold. I mean, I still figuring to keep 11 defensive line in which is a lot hmm. I don't see - day Shaun Hall making it although he played he's going to have to tear it up and weeks two and three probably for as well to make it but that's where if they keep 60 fensive ends. That's really what do you worry? Because we know that sweat and Courier locks, it's your assuming they're going to keep Sharif Miller because he's drafty and then if you're going to keep six because Joe Osmond is gone. It's either going to be hall or Harrell, right? So yeah, we'll see how that shapes up a over camp, but I think you hit on the head. There's the depth there is going to be so Right now that it's going to be difficult for him to make that team. So we'll have to you know, see how it plays out and see who stays healthy over the next few weeks. You're who are in Jacksonville right now, the birds are actually headed your way. Although I've trained ready for you're getting out of there what today? Yeah, actually no, I'm going to be here and what we're taping this on a Sunday. I'll be here Monday as well. Alright, okay, and they'll be a head down there for their previous crease in the game. Yes. Yes, and they play Thursday. It's a situation where the Jaguars they sit up to about four or five days. Ago were relatively healthy. Now. They've got 15 players who were injured. It's crazy. They against the Ravens in practice apparel. You were very good. But in the game they struggled because a lot of starters didn't play because they're hurt. They're they've got a minimum of two offensive line starters out. They've got to start a receiver who's out there. Very later running back. They're not going to backup quarterback defensively. They've got a bunch of guys hurt. It's just it's going to be tough. So the Eagles will play in Jacksonville this week, they'll depending on who they want to use their going to have they'll be they'll be able to get things done. But I think in the end when we just sum this up for The eagles they learn a lot in this game about their backups again. Don't let the score full you. Yes their backups who had to play against the Titans first offensive unit. Didn't fare all too. Well, although I think Joshua had held his own against chalawan, but you that's what you expect. Your hope is the backups will have to play as much against the ones that they'll they'll just when you in terms of when you need a breather. Yes, you could put them in doing a during the regular season and hopefully hold up, but your hope they don't have to play. Out of minutes because that's when that's when matchups are a little bit tougher for them. Right? Right and we'll talk about it again next week after the Jack's team you and I will do this and we'll give you player evaluations and we'll go through who stood out who didn't hopefully there won't be any major injuries and will say maybe there'll be another trade knowing how way between us. All right, that'll do it for inside the birds the leading podcast if Eagles tell intelligence check for Adam Kaplan, I'm Jeff moisture, as always. We appreciate our listeners and we thank you for flying with us inside. Hide the burns.","– The Philadelphia Eagles' quarterback situation just got a lot worse. ESPN's Adam Kaplan calls it ""Widespread Panic All Over the Delaware Valley"" in a podcast with Adam Kaplan of Inside the Birds, noting that backup Nate Sudfeld is out for the season with a left wrist fracture. It's a big setback for the Eagles, who were already thin at the position with two-year starter Carson Wentz out with a knee injury and signed free agent Cody Kessler in the offseason. But it's not all bad news for the team. ESPN's Ian Rapoport calls the Eagles ""one of the most intriguing teams in the NFL"" in a separate podcast with Rapoport. He notes that they're rumored to be interested in free-agent QB Colin Kaepernick, who has said he wants to sit during the national anthem this season to protest racial injustice.",0.23809523809523805,0.14285714285714285

I like your song. It kind of bugged me a little bit that they use it for the TV. Show Ballers. Okay, because I feel like it Waters it down a little bit. I feel like the reason you put this on for the podcast today was because we gave you a hard time about not knowing what the best rap songs were when we did that list on the air. Yeah. Well that list is garbage by the way, and I'm pretty sure you said this was your favorite song It's a my top 10. I don't really have a top like an actual order to my top 10 but I love this song. I like Lil Wayne a lot. Is this like your in your top ten rap songs are your top? Songs of all time top 10 rap songs, but I do like this song that with you my top 10 rap songs. I don't really have it though. That's what I'm saying. I'm just saying like this would probably be in the top 10 if I was thinking about it. Okay, you know, I like Lil Wayne's collaborations with Eminem as well as find that's a nice pairing between the two if I hear Lil Wayne A Millie, come on. I can't I can't turn the station no matter what station is on Millie. Let me see if I can find. Dead come on, of course, I do right here. I got it. It's on my top. Ten list. This is my kind of rap song what you like. Little little little like deep heavy baby and knowing or Jam. Yeah Medtronic my Millionaire on my Young Money Millionaires of my generation are my what was the song that they said was the greatest rap song of all time Avis ridiculous because they were all super old songs and they were all influential in their time. But when you add up all the songs, there are in the The world I bet you the like fight all the top five that we went through are barely getting play Grandmaster Flash was a lot of founding fathers of rap. But the the number one song. They said of all time was juicy by Big E. Hmm. That one's still getting played quite a bit. Yeah. Yeah, and I have apparently I'm the only person who had never really liked I wouldn't have been able to tell you the name of that song. Just and I think it's mostly because I only got into hip-hop and rap or whatever, you know in the last 10 years. I didn't grow up with it. You got a lot of music to go through the I know I like those documentaries that play on HBO every now and then they have like the series where they look at the origins of rap music totally. It's kind of cool just to get a brief history of all that just like it's cool to get a brief history of any music. Genre, like you know, when I first started working for an oldies radio station when I was in Regina, you were working for an oldies radios. Well, there were two stations in the building. There was CJ me Regina is best oldies and then I was on like z-99 today's best music. I was working back and forth and I didn't know any of the oldies songs, but then I was they gave me some stuff to watch the material to go through. Okay learning about you know, why all these Are so significant and cool, you know how like the evolution of rock and roll is essentially? Yeah through artists like Elvis Presley and the Beatles and you know, British Invasion stuff. So that was interesting when I started working and radio. I was working at a classic rock station as you know, because that's when we are careers cross paths many years ago. Yeah. I love this story. You know, which one you're going to tell I used to screw up. I was like 20 and I was working at a classic rock station is used to screw up the names all the time. Time if there's Bruce cockburn and if a tree falls in the forest or a soggy, I remember there's a song called In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida and it was like one word In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida and I remember seeing that going like what what is this in the god? The the man got out of Eden? Maybe I know that song. There's another oh, there's the Jimi Hendrix who do chilly actually pronounced Voodoo Child. Yeah, but I it's spelled Voodoo, Chile. Yeah. Okay. What's the girl T to do that's around the time that they switched me to the top 40 station gotta get this girl off the stage and blowing her credibility. Yeah Classic Rock Fans. I worked at a classic rock station as well. And I found that classic rock fans are the absolute like I don't want to say worse. But like if you if you mess something up. Oh, yeah, if you like a song like Strawberry Fields by The Beatles, I knew I don't know how many He hops in the in the building. That would not song was playing. There's a there's a part of the song where it fades down. Yeah Fades back up. Yeah. I don't know how many hops like cut the song This song there. Yeah, just get over phone calls and text messages. What's wrong with you Helter Skelter from the Beatles. Does that as well? It fades out about 45 seconds before the song actually ends, then it fades back in learned that one the hard way. I remember after the chili is it? I decided that I would answer every single phone call and I took that would have been great radio if I put all that on the air because I just it would have been great. You know that beat to shreds. Oh, I mean the phone's kept ringing for like 45 minutes after tell your DJ the cheese a dumbass. Yeah, that's me that's been talking to her. A lot of people think it's like I talk radio station where you're going to call in and you're gonna get some call screener. When you call us when we work on an FM radio station, we're all in the room. We can all hear the call. Even if it's not one of us answering. It's Bunda see, you know, and we can hear you we can hear so in here, there's no like, oh tell the person on the radio. He's an asshole. It's like what you've just told me. I'm the person on the radio. It's funny how much softens when they're like, oh you can hear me. Oh, you're the person on the radio. I mean, all I need to say is that you know, you really should do your homework. Yeah. Well, I told you that time when I am accidentally He did a sports trivia question and I was like, where's Wayne Gretzky from and instead of saying Branford. I said Brampton and it was just it kind of came out wrong. Oh my God. Same thing as Classic Rock Fans Sports Nuts. Oh, yeah. Well just need to drive it home. Same thing probably had a hundred calls after that you dummy well because I was doing a contest with someone and I told him they got it wrong. Yeah. Yeah. Well, no, I think I don't think they sell. Said Branford, they said something else and I said no Brampton. Idiot. Yeah, I get Brampton and Brantford and no brand fraud from Bradford Bradford. See forget it. I get those two mixed up all the time. It's confusing traffic and I got like a collision and Bradford. I'm screwed. It shouldn't be allowed to have two cities that are towns named so closely, you know Afters we using the similar letters or how about this. A speaking of the worst. Uh-huh. You know what you see here are show on Wednesday. Sometimes we do the worst Wednesdays. The worst is Whitby and Pickering both have a brock is Brock Road and Brock Street one of them now it's changed since they've reconfigured like added the new highway to the 407 but it used to be you'd have to be on Brock and I was getting mixed up road to get up to the 407 the one that's in Pickering. Yes anyway. I got off the one that was in Whitby or whatever before and was a whole nightmare. I just remember swag. Why would you have two of the same name? So close to each other? They're literally what 10 minutes down from each other on the fall one crazy. It is crazy. You know, it's like it off at Dundas F versus Dundas Street, like why you never do that? No, we're have Whitby next to wit blue or you know, like when Yahweh we play or Whitby stupid. Welcome to another podcast we do to usually to we can we always have the take two podcast which is where we just have like a compilation of all the stuff we did from the week on the radio that we put out there and then we do we try and do like just a new content version. Yeah, which is what we're doing right now and we try and get one out every week. But sometimes we miss one for whatever reason there's things that come up. Mmm. I'm not sure what exactly you want to do. This one. I could play you an audio clip here from Kelly Clarkson she's got a new talk show. What do you think the chances of this lasting are you know, I've interviewed Kelly and she is lovely and just lots to say always right. Yeah. She's never a boring interview. So I think she's going to be good at this job. You think yeah. I wonder if people thought the same thing about Ellen because I'm a little more skeptical of Kelly Clarkson's ability to like Captivate an audience for an hour every day. She's funny. Did she start off with a few big like Yes on her show though, too. Well, she was supposed to have Chris Chris Hart no heart Kevin Hart. Sorry and then he got in that car accident. So the rock ended up stepping in for her him. I just be nice. I just noticed that a lot of the audio that's being sent to our away and some of our prep Services. It's just her singing on the show really like their yeah, it's as though it's like well, I don't know maybe you can sing because that's her real skill set. So, this is Kelly Clarkson covering Miley Cyrus is Is Wrecking Ball on her show? Wow, I mean she can really sing but I find that weird. Like if singing came up in a natural way in a conversation and she just started belting out that would be cool. But the fact that she has a band and she's doing like a mini concert. What? It's nice. Okay, we're and she's doing it a lot. Here's Kelly Clarkson covering the weekend. I can't feel my face. It's almost like she's doing a variety show, but she's the only guest I feel like I'm at a wedding and it's like a wedding band up on stage and you'd rather hear the CD version of the song, you know, yeah. I mean, she's so talented. I just find it a little bit annoying when you have people that are really good at one thing and they just assume they'll be really good at another thing and I guess with daytime talk shows. They do that a lot with celebrities. I know Harry Connick jr. Had one for a bit. I can't imagine that show still on I never hear about it. Alan was definitely a rising star in that format. Who would have seen that coming maybe you know, although so good. Yeah, she She's the new Oprah, you know, everyone was wondering who is going to be the new queen of daytime talk or King for that matter and she's definitely rise and risen up to that level. You know, who I the jury is out on Lilly Singh. Oh, yeah. It's seen her show. She can do some funny bits on her show because that's sort of what she did on YouTube She's a Canadian YouTube star from you know, the greater Toronto area and she got this job. She comes on. I think it's called a little late. Her with Lily saying so there's The Tonight Show, then you got Seth Meyers and then it's her show and what I find a little bit annoying as it's just I'm getting tired of seeing people hired for jobs that they have no skills to do and it's all based on something else. They've done in their life. So you're saying based on her YouTube content. This is totally a stretch for her. Well look for the bits, and I haven't watched a lot. Her show but maybe there's tons of bits. She's really good at the bit part. But then the whole talking with people and having to do the other 85% of the show. I don't feel like it's really her wheelhouse per se because I watched parts of it a few times trying to see if you know if it's any good and it reminds me of an infomercial where you have somebody playing the role of a talk show host and you know, it just is that it's got that stick sticky insincerity or you know, they're working too hard to do it. Well, you give her a chance man. I will you know, how people are Rusty when they first get going took me many many many years before I felt like I figured out yeah morning radio, but you know, you had worked in radio a long time before you had a chance to do morning radio. And before you got a regular shift on the radio, you were doing overnights. You're working your way up. And so here's somebody who's a YouTube Star. Let's give her her own show on a major Network in the u.s. Right away. It's a Blog. It's a lot to take in and I'm starting to see that in radio a lot where people are hired for all the things that they're good at off the air. Yes. Yes, it's hot Trend. Yeah, you know, you see people it's like oh, well, they look like the demo, uh, you know, this is a radio station that's trying to cater to 30 year olds while they're just under 30 and they have great Instagram videos and they have a large Instagram audience. I'll block they must be good on the radio. Let's put them on and then it's a disaster. It's funny how important Instagram followers are these days even my acting agent said like you now when they have casting notifications that go out to agencies across the GTA. They will literally sometimes say we only want people who have over 10,000 followers to come out for this one. Yeah, because they want influencers who are promoting whatever the show is on social media as well. Okay, I get what you're saying, but if the product ends up being Bad then it's a lose lose lose lose. The person gets on camera and they suck well because like with Lilly Singh for example, right for some reason the Rotten Tomato score by the critics it giving it a hundred percent the show, but wow audience scores at 49 and on IMDb the scores at three point three out of ten. So there's a massive disconnect from from what obviously suits or critics or whatever looking for versus what the audience is actually looking for and don't get me wrong. I mean it television hosting is a hard thing to get good at until you're doing it. It right sure so radio might be a little different. I'm just I guess I get a little bitter because I had to work my way up and then I see other people just slide into these jobs because they you know shot a quirky Instagram video and I'm like what the hell is going on? And you know, what I loved is when is when they hired to replace David Letterman because they went with experience over like the somebody's image. Okay, and it This is all part of the evolution of reality TV. And you know, you don't need to be a skilled broadcaster in order to be a great broadcaster and that may be true some of the time but they hired Steven Colbert to replace Letterman a guy who's like already 50 ish, right 50-something. Yeah, they didn't you know, you would think looking at the trends in television and radio and stuff. They would hire somebody who's young they have a great Instagram following and they'll figure out the job after he was a guy who was on The Daily Show. He had his own talk. You know like character-driven TV show with The Colbert Report and he's Super Hyper intelligent and funny and smart and he went in that job and now he's number one. Right? And I love that because he's definitely not the person you know, when I was working at the other radio station, we were at yeah our boss when we first got there just after I was hired they hired our new boss. Yeah, she would have never hired me for that job. You told her that to her face, but because you know, I didn't fit check all those boxes. Is everything else outside of being on the air right? Look the hair box the hair box. I'm not single. I'm not on Tinder. I'm not doing all these things at a relatable to our audience, but it's like it doesn't mean I can't talk about them. This seems to be a trend in the entertainment business that it's not about how good you are at the job you're going to be doing it's everything else and I find that annoying. So I feel like that's a little bit the case with Kelly Clarkson. She's this great performer on stage, but now she's doing a talk show and it's feels a little weak does it? Feel like she's doing a talk show. It feels like she's doing a concert Terror feels a little bit like Canadian Idol or I American Idol I should say with her playing these cover songs. Yeah, and then she has to do all the interviewing and stuff. But you know, maybe she'll learn enough and Conan O'Brien was not amazing when he first started hosting late night television because he was a writer before he was ever a performer, right and he got good at it. So man, it's a tough gig I've done live TV before it is terrifying. Bye Mmm Yeah, but I count you down 3 2 1 then they throw it to you and you're like, you know, there's a certain adrenaline behind it and you get kind of addicted to that high. But if you screw up, it's gone like you can't get it back. You can't redo it. Yeah. Well, I want to see Lilly Singh do really well because she's Canadian and you know like you do so female hosts are yes, but then I you know, I also think of like, there's a lot other stronger females that I think could have got that job, you know. Sarah Silverman or like Whitney Cummings or a Tina Fey, but you know, they may not have even wanted the job. So he knows your true. It's like the late late late later show that comes on at I she must come on at 1:30 in the morning or something live. No, no, no. Okay. Yeah, it's all recorded. And to be honest all late-night television these days nobody is even watching it live you ask, you know, Fallon or Kim or any of those guys and they say it's all about the bits that end up on YouTube and getting the views there. Well, there you go. That's why they hired Leasing I guess it's alright the bits that end up on YouTube. Why do you think they hired her? Yeah, but yeah, that's a really good point. But then you actually go to watch the show and inside when you're not doing the bit. It's a struggle, but I guess if they don't care about that, maybe it doesn't matter. Maybe it buys her a bit of time to get stronger at that interviewing part. If it's really about the YouTube. It's right. Yeah, they must know what they're doing those suits. Yeah kiss. I'm starting to sound like a grumpy old guy you had to be good at At the job to get it you have to move to Regina. I had to live in hell Saskatchewan was a hell. Yeah, you wouldn't go back a nice people. Oh my God. It's the last place. I would go really in Canada that are met Manitoba would suck. But I think I'd rather be a Manitoba because they have close to Lake of the Woods and canora and Lake Winnipeg and I like to sail and stuff but Saskatchewan there is water there, but In a whole lot else that is a boring Province an amazing oldies station. Apparently not anymore turned into a news talk when I was there. I was the last morning guy on that oldies station. Oh really? They had to change the whole format after you left. Well, no, they fired the guy and then they like hey, why don't you sit there do it for two weeks before we flip to a new stock? Okay, so I did do it. You know who did it was the morning guy? There is the guy who does the weather for CTV News Tom Brown? Oh cool downtown Tom Brown. Wow, he's always out of breath. He is a breath I think about when I'm watching is whether I'm like it's okay. We got a little extra time. He's on he's under the gun again to squeeze it all in my TV. Yeah 45 seconds to get it all in I think he's great at it. I think it's good. Yeah, what did you want to talk about in this podcast Laura blew me away. I've been reading all morning about this huge sex trafficking ring. That was just taken down in Ontario and I know it's bit dark but like these are things I only hear about in the movies and to think that it's actually happening it like the Kingpin of the sex trafficking ring was in Toronto when they arrested him this happens all the time in in our country and you know, so in my experience in you know, reading about these stories like you're talking about is that people's perception of what sex kicking is versus what it actually is are two different things. Everyone just assumes that these are people who wanted to come to Canada. Maybe they came across in a container hidden or something right there rushing or Eastern European they end up here and then there you know used as you know prostitutes and stuff in order to pay their fair, right because all of a sudden the price went up when they got here and there and don't get me wrong that happens, but it also happens to people who Are from Canada who live here? It could be someone who runs away from home and all of a sudden they meet up with a guy who's like really helping her out and then all of a sudden they start doing drugs together and it's all like they basically luer you in and then before, you know, what you owe the guy a bit of money and now in order to pay him back, he's going to start bringing you to the strip joint to start working for your money that way on. Oh, by the way, also you're going to have to prostitute yourself. Self because now you owe us two thousand dollars for the drugs that you've been taking with me and then you're stuck in this world of like doing drugs and owing people money and they hold you hostage essentially because of that and debt to pay off and you have no one in your you've left home. You're not you know, you've left home for a reason because maybe you're being abused there or whatever and you're stuck in this world and no one's there to rescue you and it's scary to think that someone who's born in Hamilton or Toronto could end up in the wrapped up in I don't know what the circumstance was. But the victims were from Quebec. They were all women from Quebec about 33 of them and they had moved them to Ontario and west across Canada. So they would slowly move you to places across the country and you'd be stuck in this, you know, either apartment or terrible hotel room with like other women who are in the same boat. Yeah, they Shuffle you around because there are so many people who are part of the the Trafficking Organization that had little stations all across the country. But these were Canadian people Canadian, you know, kingpins and Canadian women police see that there were two extremely terrified women who called police they had tried to escape before and failed and were like violently beaten and assaulted they told police these guys were holding roughly 30 women hostage they were using To keep them there and based on that phone call. They were able to start this investigation a year ago and caught basically the Kingpin organizer of this sex trafficking ring. But the thing that freaks me out is like I saw a photo of him getting in the back of a cruiser. Yeah, and he did not look like a pimp wasn't wearing a fur coat like the pimp costume you get yeah Halloween that Rises you I mean not looking like a pimp at all when I went to University. I lived in a building that was owned by the Hells Angels and the these two have a went to a place called Bishops University and in Lenox Hill Quebec. They had a clubhouse there. Yeah, I think it's now gone or shut down or something, but it was a legit Hells Angels compounded had bulletproof glass in the building. It had electrified fences out front. Anyway, our landlord would tell us stories about the guys who you know, he would have to interact with because he was Working for them. They have a lot of legitimate businesses because they have to be able to launder their money that they get through drug sales and stuff and he would say, you know, a lot of these guys don't look anything like what you would imagine, you know, they're not always riding around on their motorcycles wearing their cots with their patch on the back. Sometimes they're wearing suits, you know, they have to play the role of business people and they are business people. They're just in a business that has a lot of corruption and crime. Yeah. So yeah, they never quite look it's never like you'd imagine. It is in the movies right very rarely. Anyway, I know so it's amazing that they they they got this drug ring. I'll tell you, you know, when I hear these stories it makes me think that we really should legalize prostitution because there are women and men who are totally okay with making money in that industry. Yep, you know if they get treated fairly and if it's safe and the fact that Tushin isn't legal is what allows all this other criminal activity to exist. And I don't know if he would ever eliminate it completely because he would be you know, we're seeing it now with legalized weed. You think one of the reasons why they did it was to put the drug dealers out of commission while they've done such a bad job with it. The drug dealers are still operating. I'm sure there's fewer of them, but it's still happening. Maybe they'll get better, right, you know because I'll get better and they not you know, like don't you think if you wanted to sell your body to make money you were comfortable with it. Didn't bother you. Yeah, don't you think you should have a right to do that? Sure. If you wanted to it's your body you can make that decision. The problem is is that in a lot of cases with the sex industry is there's a lot of people who are being forced into it and it's not their decision and they're not comfortable doing it and they end up it's essentially it's a form of rape. So are they afraid to come forward because what they're doing is illegal, is that it like well, what do you mean that people that are being sex trafficked? Yeah. No, I think they're just being held hostage and they really don't see a way out. The duty as you said that you know people were getting beaten if they try and Escape. Yes, and they're not given access to necessarily phones or whatever. You know, we say by the way, if you're ever in a situation where you're around somebody like this and they're not act they're acting like it's okay and that you know, they're happy to be there that it usually isn't the case and they're told to put a front up like that sure and you know, they have the fear of of the retribution. Yes, but also some of these People and it's not just women. It's sometimes man, but they, you know, they're addicted to drugs now because they're trying to cope with all the terrible things that are going on in their life. So it ends up being this like terrible hole there in that. They just can't imagine climbing out of yes, because you know, they get the drugs through the people that are holding them hostage. And and now you owe the money so Gary. Yeah, it's terrible. What a great topic for our podcast. Yes. You're welcome. I saw an article about a serial killer. I did see a segment on 60 Minutes about this serial killer that they've who's in jail in the United States and they figure he is the worst one in the history of the country. I read an article about this one it figure he's killed possibly run 90 people and he got away with it forever like a 70s or something. There's an old man and now he's starting to talk. There was this one guy this one police officer. I think like a Texas Ranger and he ended up having a conversation with a guy and found. A way to get him to talk and now he's been super Cooperative to the point where and this guy's memory of the crimes is insane. Really? Yeah. So these serial killers are killing people and they're taking you know snapshots with their mind because that's how they you know, they live off that it's almost and they have their trophies and stuff like that and some cases it's mental trophies. This guy was giving details about crimes that happened decades ago that were spot on which is how they were able to figure out that he was telling the truth about the people he had Old he was providing information on all these cold cases that were never solved and so in that they've linked him positively to so many more murders than he was in initially charged with when he was caught the first time. So what kind of mental trophies does this guy have? Well, he just he has a photographic memory of the crime scenes and the things that he did to these people and stuff that only the killer would know, you know what I mean? And so there he's providing this information to this. Texas Ranger who ended up having multiple interviews with him because he was just like this Floodgate of information it got to the point where this guy the serial killer was painting pictures of the victims and they were able to identify the victims from the paintings. He was doing and in some cases they're just be someone he followed from a bar and murdered. You know what I mean, like think about interactions you had a month ago with somebody that didn't lead to murder buddy on the street, but, you know trying to draw a picture of them and this guy had the image just crystal clear in his Ray so after watching that episode is do you think that there is a way that you could have deterred this guy from choosing you as a victim or if he was killing you. Is there a way that you could have like did he get pleasure in you being in pain? So all that all the terrible things you have nightmares about you is like you're not in pain. Is that going to make him stop? They didn't really get into that. I have no idea. There's some sort of fight back. Don't fight back, you know, try and make them feel. Well. There was a story we covered the other day. Where somebody was able to convince the killer that you know to feel bad for them and they were able to get away even in Silence of the Lambs like once the woman who was in the well started telling him about herself. Yeah. He's getting angry about it angle it. Yeah. I just wish there was a tactic you could use I don't think there's a tactic to deal with, you know one that works for sure right? Sometimes it probably works to fight back other times, maybe not I mean The one thing they always seem to do in these movies is when you see someone kidnapped or abducted is that they try and get the parents or the family members on television hoping that the kidnapper or abductor will see it and then feel like summer more some remorse and you see the humanity and the person they're not an object. They're not like a yes a tool for sexual gratification. It's a daughter. It's a brother, you know what I mean, right we talk about something else. This is so dark speaking of 60 Minutes. I can't believe you don't watch that show. You send an email to me last night about how much you love the show. Yeah, and I was like, okay, I'm going to watch it. You are a but I can't find it Sunday night 7 p.m. Okay, so I'll be ch-ch-ch RCBS having the Canadian. I tried to like find it on demand not available like really on Netflix movie know. Okay. I'll try to file. I'll set the DVR. It's such. Great show if you want to try and figure or learn a little bit about something sounds a bit like an old man show, but I'll get it totally comes across as an old man show, but you start watching an episode of 60 minutes and chant it. I very rarely would I ever want to fast forward? They're so good at what they do really? Well even understanding like what's going on in the US with the impeachment and what the different sides are saying, you know get caught up on that. Yeah. We're like there's all kinds of protesting going on in Hong Kong. Do you have any idea why like you see The clips on the news and so, you know trying to get a better understanding of that. They give you like a full idea of what's going on why they're acting out. I need to understand that because I hear the Raptors at the first like home opening game. Everyone's getting a t-shirt that says, you know, the Toronto Raptors stand with Hong Kong. Well, there was an NBA official somebody in the NBA who tweeted something that was pro-china. Okay. The Hong Kong is sort of its in The control of China but it's always had a level of Independence. Okay were able to act and they and so the people that live there wanted to be a full democracy. Okay, and China wants to be able to pull back on the freedoms that they've had for so long and so now the people are protesting and then it's getting one of those things where the cops are beating up the protesters. So the protesters are now using violence against the police and the armies and that's very interesting. I shot a couple of episodes of an HG TV show Years ago in Beijing and I remember being there and my boyfriend at the time came with me and the production staff was like, you know, you guys should wear wedding bands because you need to be married to be sharing a hotel room. Oh, really? Yeah in Beijing although but that seemed to care that's China right? They were like you really should wear wedding bands guys, so that that was interesting. Yeah. That's a learned about great white sharks. Okay. What about great whites There's a lot more of them on the east coast of the US and Canada. Oh, yeah, like around Halifax Nova Scotia. Is that why there's more shark attacks? So we're hearing there is a well there certainly was like the first death since the 30s in Cape Cod as a result of the great white sharks and you want to know why there's more of them pollution. No because there's more seals in the area because they are a protected animal on because seal populations have been increasing around Cape Cod in that part of Eastern United States. The the fish are coming in to eat, right? Well that's quite Couric's or sharks were like borderline is extinct for a while. Great whites who great whites were seen there were fewer and far between and that area now, they're repopulating. But what I also learned from that episode of the students here is that nobody's ever seen a great white shark mate, isn't that crazy? They have no no one's ever witnessed them mating or giving birth. I don't think what would be crazy is witnessing a great white shark. Having sex with another I'd be like, oh my God. Yeah. Are you seeing this that shirts penis is huge even know how they mate. I'm just I was just about to Google. Yeah. Well mate. I don't think it's like thrusting. I'm sure it's more of an injection some are. Yeah, but there must be some Rod that goes in to do the injection is there's so many animals. I have no idea how they made. Is it a laying of a An egg situation and then another shark comes along and fertilizes the Egg sharks. No because they give birth they have it in the belly. They got it inside so they got to get see millions in their belief based on observations of other shark species researchers believe male white sharks must first bite their mates near their heads and a little affection Larry the very end there. They don't hang around in pods. They're very autonomous. They sort of move around on their own. Okay. Then they insert their claspers claspers American class. / yeah. Sounds like you get a little jolt a it. Sounds like you get a little jolt. Let me look at a class. / yeah, here it is. Is it similar to the male penis it actually when it's totally up underneath the underside it almost looks like a vagina. Because it's got it this sort of two of them and there's they're held up underneath so they look it looks like the opening of a vagina, but I guess they kind of are able to extend them. So is a shark mating with another shark belly-to-belly or is it back to more of like a through the shark's mouth female shark has a marine biologist join us on our next podcast. Now, I would imagine that the the private parts go into the private parts. No, but I mean do you go belly to belly or just one have to go on the other back? Hmm. I'm looking at pictures. I can't say that I'm thinking about it. I do remember being at the Toronto aquarium and seeing shark eggs. Oh, yeah, so do after their inseminated do they release the eggs? And then they hatch or do they hatch inside the like uterus? So whatever it is would be in the shark and then swim out. It's crazy, man. Oh my God, there's so much. They didn't cover that in a 60-minute episode. You clearly learned nothing. Yeah, but all I'm telling you now. I mean, I feel like I learned a lot from 16 minutes of a piece. Uh-huh. I love watching it. Well enough that's kind of sounded like I knew what I was talking about for a while there and now it all just fell to Pieces about the pimp costume. No for cocaine. Yeah. Did you know that term? No was hit by a hurricane. My kids tried to tell me this story. I guess they were learning about it in school or something. I'm like, there's never been a hurricane in Toronto. Like maybe the after effects of a hurricane. Yeah, you got to be kind of near a coast. Yank. But it was 65 years ago. I think even this week it's the 65th anniversary of a hurricane that hit Toronto where a bunch of people died. In fact, it was originally a Corey for storm that affected South Carolina, but it was still registering as a category 1 hurricane when it slammed into Toronto back 65 years ago. It was called Hurricane Hazel and 80 people were killed really they thought they didn't really have the kind of forecast that we have today and they were expecting some rain, but what they ended up getting was 200 millimeters of rain really quickly and it flooded the Humber River. River as well as the dawn River and people used to live down by the Humber River really in a van down by the river know and you know, they had homes and stuff and so people and homes and vehicles were washed away and people drowned there was thousands of families 4,000 families were displaced as a result of this man, and it's so they eventually changed the whole rules about where you could live around. These rivers and because of this hurricane, so I guess they've learned a lot from it. I find like when I'm driving on Bayview and the Bayview extension by the DVP when you're down in the valley when you're near Evergreen brickworks, I'm like, why don't more people live down here. It's beautiful. Yeah, why because it's a protected area that you're not allowed to live in they you know, people whose homes were fine. They ended up like knocking them down and write displacing them as a result of that. I just hate when I'm When my kids are like there was a hurricane in Toronto like this never been in a hurricane. He talking about there's no way we're in land right like bitter was and then I looked it up and I was like, oh my God, you're right. I can't wait for your kids to prove you wrong over and over again, you know, well they will they will for sure. I'll tell you something when you were 13 year old that they are right about everything no matter what the truth is really that. Oh, yeah. So annoying. Yeah, why just even remember? Something as stupid as my daughter was trying to tell me that we'd became legal on October 21st. I'm like no it was October 17th. We covered it a lot at work. No, it was a 21st. We had to do the whole well, look it up. You know, she sounds exactly like you a little carbon copy of you Tucker's wow. Wait till your daughter's older. I can't wait. I love that. I know that direction you're headed in because I have two daughters. I love like seeing you go. The different steps that I've already been through reminiscent like do you have fond memories when I tell you about like yesterday we were in The Distillery District. I was picking her up from daycare and she pretty much jumped in every single muddy puddle that existed on my way home from the daycare was soaked from the waist down. Yeah. My difference is I wouldn't be as fun as you in that scenario here. I stopped her and less we were you're right next door. So I guess it's not a big deal. Yeah. I was just like do it and all the tips. They're having fun. Yeah, that wouldn't really bother me I guess but if we had to get in my car and go somewhere I would have never allowed that to happen because then there'd be you know mud everywhere. Yeah, my guess that's gonna do it for us Maura. Yeah fundus fun times as always if you're listening to the end of this. Thank you. I don't know. I don't know if it was a really good one today if you like. It was sort of dark and all over the place happens sometimes when there's dark stuff in the news, right? And I was also like feeling as though I was talking about stuff. I didn't really know about it's not really an expert on shark mating about a lot of stuff and that's all thanks to 60 minutes. Anyway, thank you and we'll see you again. You know me.","– It's not every day you get the chance to sit down with a radio host and discuss his or her favorite rap songs, but that's exactly what happened to Canada's Kane Brown. In an interview with Power 103.7 in Toronto, the host asked him what his favorite rap song is. ""I don't really have a top like an actual order to my top 10 but I love this song,"" he replied. ""I do like this song that with you my top 10 rap songs. I don't really have it though. That's what I'm saying. I'm just saying like this would probably be in the top 10 if I was thinking about it."" (Listen to the full interview here.) He went on to explain that he didn't grow up with rap because he only got into it in the last decade. ""I didn't grow up with it,"" he said. ""You got a lot of music to go through the documentary series where they look at the origins of rap music totally. It's kind of cool just to get a brief history of all that just like it's cool to get a brief history of any music.""",0.15151515151515152,0.060606060606060615

This is episode 7, which have been a here and I'm joined the University of Southern Belles Chief songwriter Phil Smith, Monica. Sorry mother. Yeah plus Mark Donnelly morning. James is back on next week as ever plenty to discuss since I last podcast something would be nothing standing 3-1 away drawn and help Northern United in a frustrating night for all concerned plus of course, the Takeover is imminent indeed. Perhaps by the time you listen. This it might have already been done. We live in Hope big Sam has been linked with a return one day over the weekend details of the new Netflix series have been revealed plus we'll have all the build-up to the weekend trip to bottom Wanderers as well so as ever plenty to to get through. So let's get cracking. We obviously talked in depth last week about the Takeover of things. I guess moved hugely since then in terms of announcements. Has it Phil but we expect news imminently. Hopefully it seems yeah. You know as we said on here a lot, it's not always particularly useful is sort of going timescales because these things change its as we've explained a lot. It's relying on a lot of different people. A lot of people who aren't necessarily directly connected to the to the people who were buying the club or selling parts of global whatever Network people who have to do their jobs and do their bit so you can never be entirely sure my understanding for what it's worth and if people are interested is that as As of as of yesterday, I was given an indication certainly my understanding was that there's some hope that it could be Monday There's was the day that this is gets signed sealed and delivered or what have you but like I say that it wouldn't take an awful lot to move that back. It wouldn't take an awful lot to move that forward. So I wouldn't get too hung up on that book what that what we can certainly say. Is this is this is now a very very close to being a done deal and Mark you got a Bittersweet including speaking to Journalists Over America from the Miami Marlins who the three prospective new owners have a swimming involvement in what what kind of things did you learn from him? And although it's not to say that necessarily Advocate that someone and I guess even indication of the kind of things they perhaps do I look to try and do yeah. It's interesting because I think a lot of parallels can probably be drawn between the situation Miami were in when that group took a you know, what is a small share about 7% in there in the baseball team to wear Sunland are now and the key thing they've done is try and make things a stain. Will they put a lot of money into their Academy? They've launched an academy in the Dominican Republic which is quite an interesting concept but something they want to try they've invested heavily in a fun experience, which I know something Tony Davison's previously can it is something that the ownership change could allow someone to maybe do a little bit more they've reduced ticket prices. They've improved their concessions. They've made standing only areas and you know that that you say there's no guarantee. They're going to do those things at Sunderland and they are a small part of what's happening at at Miami. Because it's you know, a big big ownership group that is in control. They're just as a comparison, you know, they invested about 85 million dollars and the whole take out whole takeover was over a billion dollars in total. So it's not all down to them. But it's a lot of positive signs a lot of things. I think some than fans. I'll be quite happy to hear if they are indeed replicated when they eventually get announced here on where side so yeah, I mean obviously when the tickles announce we'll do a takeover special. So we'll move on for now. There's not much to say really until it's done basically. Accrington Stanley summoned fell behind it for five minutes bounce back very quickly Linda Gooch going a brilliant volley two minutes later and then by halftime they were there are 3-1 up. Yet there's still quite a lot. Chris isn't wasn't a despite the fact that someone won 3-1 away from home. I think most ones would usually take that as a no a result. Perhaps some funds not happy that they didn't go and put four or five past acronym of the failed yet again to keep it clean sheet filcher. What was your take on that ground game and the resultant performance? I think it was. I mean, it's a difficult issue. It's a complex issue. I think that You know, we've probably probably reached a point I think a little bit where I don't want say the novelty of League one, but there's there's no doubt that I think everyone would say that it's feels a little bit less fun this season. That's not a not a criticism of anybody. I think it's perfectly understandable that last year there was that sense of adventure extensive freshness New Beginnings that probably allowed the probably put a different slant on on the me the matches the the quality of football in some games and what View and and that's probably not there this season because of the kind of the heard of Wembley the disappointment of having to sort of come back for another year and leave one and and I think that's still there a little bit I would never criticize anybody for that because we don't want be covering some of them. They won. We want to be covering some the championship some in the Premier League You Know Jack Ross wants to be managing summoned in the championship in the Premier League The Players won't be playing for Sunderland and in the championship. So it's there's that are of that are of pressure. Assure them that yeah, there was pressure last year, but it is just a different vibe and this year and that puts a different slant on analysis because if people see things in games that they think raises concerns about the possibility of going up the season then it's going to be it's going to be heightened. It's going to draw actually criticism this year because nobody wants it a third year in this division. So I think that's probably where that frustration comes from that someone didn't go out and turn it into a five. We know whatever and then it just comes down you're being on football because some people will believe a lot in momentum in making a statement send the message out that kind of thing personally personally. I don't Peterborough, you know in my eyes if that was true Peterborough when they went to New Look which I met Ivan 160 over the weekend with a chummy with the Falls of the didn't came back and won drunk came and Drew 2-2, so I don't worry too much about that. But I think the context for that kind of environment is people just this desperation. To not be in Li one next year is unfortunately going to draw and an intense scrutiny on on any part of someone's game and performances that suggest that they might they might not get in the top two. So I think that's probably where it comes from and it it is difficult when you know, three one win away from home and three fantastic goals, you know, it's tough if you're in a position as a club while that doesn't feel like a fantastic day out. Yeah, but that's just unfortunately that's just kind of probably the reality of weather. It's funny because I was here obviously in the office at they working and I drank it just everything was okay before we left and you were like was lots of criticism. There's a criticism on Twitter. I was like what really it just won 3-1 away from home. I couldn't quite father meant but he hosts which is life at the minute Ross then did his press conference on Monday at the Academy a light head of the rather than game on Tuesday night and say it was a bit feisty lot of passion which I guess was good to see a took umbrage, I think. At the the way the question was posed that weekend. It was a good result but a pool performance and he hit that quite strongly jet Ross probably one of the first times I've seen him seem do that gave a defensive aside and said that's too much negativity around each sort of results and then it kind of time sort of hold the club back. It was really interesting comments what we are take on it Mark Festival. I think as you say it was quite good to see because he is quite quite not laid back, but he's quite measured in what you said. You never gets too high never gets too low. I think Stephen Elliott the former sudden strike alluded to on Twitter. It was good to see that fire in him that that desire that he does want to do. Well, you know, he wants to push the club on and I do think he's got a valid point that as Phil says, you know, everything this season is going to be kind of intensely critiqued. Everything's going to be looked at in detail because they need to go out a ligue 1. There's no question about it. They need to get promoted the season. Well, you know a 3-1 win away from home against a current in the team that you know this time last week. We were sat here saying would would post some form of threat to As they always have because they do like to play football. You know, they've got a crack in Pitch now home since the work they've done over the summer and you know, they want to play football. They want to get at teams. They were always going to pose a threat and I think a 3-1 away win is nothing to be nothing to be complained about whether aspects of the performance that could be improved of course, but, you know not playing it a hundred percent and still managing to score three goals and win away from home is what promotion winning teams do and that's what's on them will need to do and keep doing you know, when the having those off days keep grinding out winds keep grounding out results, you know, not necessarily saying they grow at the grounded out at akwonton because it was in the end quite comfortable but winning when you're playing badly is not necessarily a bad thing and it was actually the other effect is a lot of funds and I guess agreed with the stancy taken it and what Jack Ross is saying that of course, I'm maybe put a bit by added pressure on your head of the choosing a game which obviously then ended in a 1-1 draw at home rather than bringing start through magma Nutley after Alamos. Mistakes passwords you make that possible. Just a lame doing a lame thing. No surprise to me brilliant touch with McNulty sort of the keeper then slaughtered home. And then of course in McGee D penalty, which was saved in that I guess was the turning point because from then on rather than who were quite impressive for back well, and we're fully deserving of a point in the end and sometimes out of the chances Charlie wake 101 which was saved and I think the gauges or denied an effort before the penalty in the first half and so yet another one. I'll draw some booze at the final whistle. I guess through frustration more than anything. But again then a bit more fun reaction against John Ross and you just kind of get in this cycle then. What did you make of the Robin game filling the performance? Pretty disappointing in the end and I think the first first half an hour was very very good at thought rather imposed bit of a threat on the counter, but primarily that was just a consequence of how son did set up and the way they were playing, you know jarrod's it moved a little nine further forward. It was a very specific game plan. We saw that from us to take in the first minute was to get the ball early either in the McGee's feet or over the top for McNulty the chase but they just looked at it. They understood the players seem to understand the game plan there. He bought into it doesn't have a lot of trust in it and it was really good to see it was a you know, rather Romero good side. I've read some things and heard some comments about them being mediocre or average. I think we need to get away from that personally. I think rather armor, it would decent side. They were unlucky not steal bless you or anyone who watch them and tell you to my eyes quite Robertson's a good place and then try to sign them last summer for a little DARPA was a good sent forward. Jake has his good place though to go out and do that in the first half. Always first half and I was very encouraging the game turns when you miss a penalty because that's a chance to I think it's very tough to see rather than coming back from that. If you don't turn that spell of dominance into a two or lead in my opinion rather than my good side and they're going to come back and have some saying that's what they did. I don't think someone's response. That was pretty great. I thought they lost a lot of composure a lot of control. I don't think they handled the last half an hour very, well. You could argue that Charlie why you should score which of course he should have done and little nitrogen better when he got free in the final minute, but I don't think I think especially at home in the stadium. I like you your objective has to be to get hold the ball for a longer period to in my opinion. Anyway build a bit of sustained pressure pain rather. I'm in a little bit get the crowd behind you mate rather and feel like they're under a lot of Russia I thought the game was too often. You always want something to go for it, but I thought maybe the went too far the other way. I lost a bit of shit possibly composure and maybe the frustration steeped into the players a little bit and I think they're going to have to handle that better this season particularly home because there will be times where they're going to go in the last 20 minutes kneading they're needing a goal and I think they'll have to handle that a little bit a little while a lot better to be honest. Having said that In McGhehey doesn't miss penalties. So you have to put it in the context that they put themselves in a great position to go to nil up. And at that point you have to think they would have gone and secured a really really good and convincing homeless play. So as you would say about any game still quite early in the season, you don't take two big conclusions from it. You don't go too far. Either way on it. There's some really good signs some really really good signs and some concern and Science and I guess until we've played another six seven games at home. We probably won't be able to draw it a proper. Collision where there are in that sense so some you know, we shouldn't get too lost in forget too much about the good signs and but definitely definitely some big things for jacking the place to ponder as well. I was at was impressed with other rooms are relentlessness at the end of we're still pushing for three or four of them later on in the game. Obviously, there are good sides when there are good side and you know, I would always I've I would never criticize anyone for saying that something should go and do really well in this league and be at the top and go and try and win the league completely agree with it, and I don't mind that at all. Sometimes I think. For whatever reason maybe we don't discuss or analyze or make judgments on the opposition as much as we would in the championship in the Premier League for understandable reasons, but I don't think anyone could look at what rather have done over the last couple years the players. I didn't the team and expect them not to do something and I'm in a game against the Sunland team. That is very good League one side, but it's not so exceptional so heavily funded that it's going to play against a team like that and Completely dominate for 90 minutes the issue for someone to course and where it's fair to kind of criticizing the right word. But question is they didn't make the most of the dominance Bell when they were really really really really good and of consider another relatively soft goal so that I think you have to you have to balance those things out and their managers bit. The character is me is any Market plenty is a post-match. Yeah. It was a bit of a surprising press conference at as someone who's never really seen Paul warned speak. He was he was quite humorous. He was quite Honest, I think in his verdict that is Side Road. They look a little bit during that kind of first 25 minutes half hour spell wear something where were completely on top, but he's obviously created quite a happy camper and it's easy to see why if he's if he's leading it. He's quite a character. He's quite upbeat, you know with as he said, you know, he's essentially overseeing to relegations that rather than easy still be a nice little still been kept in the job. So he's obviously got something about him and as Phil said, you know, they've built a very very good squad. They've got some really good players there. They've used alone Market well, I said call the Morrison their Daniel leaves and the keeper look like good players both of whom were in alone. And I think they will be be there or thereabouts the end of the season and you know, Paul warns to the relatively young manager and you could be could well be in for bigger things in the future just go about the weekend after the acronym game with a few hours after that big sound was linked with a possible return to summon one day so that he's opened. Well, there was actually direct codes but the piece itself so that he was open to return the management and that You'll be able to return the cylinder some some point in the future. Obviously Jairus in charge at minute. Would you welcome a big some returning at some point? I just think that's just it certainly likes to spend money. Not lose more than the Premier League. It's a different kettle of fish cylinder league-wide. Yeah, I look at Big Sam did let some fantastic memories here at Sunland. He'll always be fondly remembered for the last few weeks that season and rightly. So it was one of the best times I've had in recent years think he left a good time. Yeah, because it allowed him to not have to worry about a legacy especially the fact that you went to the England job, you know, nobody can say for certain how it would have spun on, you know, what would have happened if he'd stayed for a longer period I'm sure results would have been fine. It's and then just all comes down to opinion and you know, I had my opinion if you look big some screwy tends not to leave you might live clubs in a better position in the table and Mary found them but you generally doesn't in my opinion leave grid structures in place. Yeah, but that's you know, that's kind of just my personal opinion big salmon other people will disagree and I've no issue with that. And certainly you left some happy memories here, but more generally I think it's something that this is going to be the biggest test for me for the new owners because everybody knows that you've got a lot of money that you got a lot of access Capital and that means you can get an awful lot of people in the game who want to get on that bandwagon who want their get on the gravy train. If you like. It's gonna be a lot of people sniffing around Sunland agents managers people want and director of football rules. All that kind of thing. Some people might be hugely talented and doing it for the right reasons and worth talking to worth listening to as an awful lot who want and we saw that in the yellow short and the other short either there was a lot of people who Got a lot got a lot out the club. Let's put it that way and I'm not sure they put an awful lot back in. It's one of the reasons why I think it's probably wise to have Stewart and Charlie staying on the club because they have that experience that they have in football will be important because that judgment I think will be will be crucial and you know, I the fact that it's big Sam I think distorts the story a little bit because he's someone who rightly fans are very very happy memories of but this is going to be a big test for the new ownership because going to be no shortage of people It known an inverted comments that they'd be interested in getting involved with some and then the reality is is where weather where there's a lot of money and I'm not referring big Sammy. I'm just talking more generally you can draw characters who might not be in it for the for the right reasons. So it's going to be a big test when if and when this takeover also, yes indeed as we were obviously report this week, John Ross has a job as a certainly safe anyway, but I guess it'll be result dependent as every manager in the league faces that same for it. So we shall see right moving on then Lynch and debauch the pair of them played against Middlesbrough under-23 that happen on Monday evening Phil was there what did you make the other pair just briefly fill tube octoly debauch got the full 90 didn't England. I got the whole nine yard. Yeah. It was it's always a difficult difficult recessed plays in this in 123's games because it's quite a strange environment for them to play in. Lynch looked pretty good in the are very vocal looked fine. Something didn't defend tickly. Well to be honest. They were if you very poor Puli lid offside trap Sagat capitalized on but you can't draw that into that much because you know, Jordan just playing alongside Brandon Taylor who probably spoken to at length of the for the first time the dressing room before the game. So if the communication and the understands a bit off you shouldn't draw too much into that, but he went off after an hour. We'll find out later today whether that was anything serious or whether it was just a little little Caution certainly didn't felt was a precaution the bark. I was really impressed with you looked you look to Cut Above. He looks like you really shouldn't be playing in the game can stroll through it a little bit when all these challenges decision making they just look pretty straightforward for I mean, I've looked particular tested. So so that was encouraging the course will be very different when he goes away to you your acronyms and balls fizzing around is a years and subtype pitch and he's got forming on the extractor smashing in women all that kind of stuff. So so I wouldn't get too carried away. But certainly it was the pretty encouraged and start from you. Look fit enough and I say you look way too good for that level which is I guess a promising sign good stuff. And as Phil says he'll get updates from Jack Ross afternoon. We were recording this at the University of Sunderland on Thursday morning with myself, Rich minute Mark Donnelly and Phil news. I was gonna say news emerged of and I put it was a lecture wasn't it here at the University about the newer Netflix series Mark and Some of the details that have come out ahead of head of that which we expect. I think they'll be February time series to have Sun until I die. What what did you glean from some of the details? Yeah. Well, he said he Leo / when the producer said he expects February, but I think they're kind of at the whims of Netflix's to their schedule of releasing shows and they can quickly change that it short notice so it could be brought forward. It could be pushed back. What come first to take over our city which to some until I die. Well, hopefully this thing over hopefully you take over and put no, I mean, I think I'll be really really Interesting watch in terms of you know, there was a lot going on behind the scenes over the ticket over last summer. Now. We see kind of the jet Rodwell puppy unibody did un dong. Yes Agha slimy at seems years ago. Suddenly. There's an Ethics how hard to remember that was just just over 12 months ago, but she then the Josh magic contract situation as well be interesting to see will Grigg deadline day and they'll be fascinating to see how that I'm at the club. Yeah, you know, I know Leo Pearlman said the the scenes and the shots he thought with a bet To a the ones in Trafalgar Square before the checkatrade trophy final which kind of gets its own episode. I think episode for the series is going to be dedicated to the the checkatrade trophy run. So it should be really interesting to watch you know to do with Donald. I'm sure will be open as ever in it. And yeah they fail to refuse fell to rule out sorrier a third season which would be be very interesting particularly. If obviously when this takeover does get announced to copy very very interesting and it's six episodes, isn't it? Rather nice? Yes, it's rather than 8 so a little bit little bit short of this time. I think the last stair The series was kind of 35 45 minute episodes. There's no indication as to what this season will be. But yeah, six episodes instead of eight five of which are focusing on the league campaign under the ownership of the club and the fans and then episode 4, as I said focusing purely on their the checkatrade trophy run in that first trip to Wembley called stuff. So we'll fought like a mouse right? Let's move on to some really questions about an absolute boat loading this week, which is good to see thank you all for your questions and Davey be from South Shields. He's been supporting the culprit. He has and Debbie asks, why did McGee take the ball from Gooch and then blow the penalty surely we have a designated. Take care. And if so, who is it Gooch has taken them with a plum in the past. There isn't a dozen apparently. No, there's nothing to whoever grabs the ball. Yes. No, it's Jack Russells belief that just leave it the place to start on the pitch. Whoever whoever ends up with the ball. And with the ball on the spot is the one who should is the best person to take it. I think it's one of those things that it's funny something because you really you are for all players who would be first choice of pretty much any club in Grant Linden Aid and then we'll Greg. Yeah and it is Harsh on Linden because he's genuinely brilliant penalty taker is very unlucky not to be the designated pilot jet. What I would say is that in had a method that was very very successful from last season just because he's missed this one, you know, you can't yeah, you can't have a revisionism and say them again. He's not good at in penalties last season didn't get you did was absolutely terrific it in penalties he has He's always done that little thing ain't which worked very very well from last year. You do wonder whether goalkeepers will eventually cotton on to that. So I don't know whether the other night was because either some knew what he was going to do in was prepared for it or whether McGee just didn't execute what he normally does. Well enough. Yeah. It's impossible to answer that. But no, I mean, you know, it's a valid debate whether you should have designated palmitate with stressors believe that you shouldn't so there isn't one. But you know, if he hadn't stepped up to the next one, I would back him to score frankly having said that link A judge can consider himself very unlucky. Yeah, he's a he's a he's a tremendous palette and we saw that on the opening day of the Season didn't we he's really really in fact, but sometimes that's just how it goes. I remember the season the Premier League when someone got relegated and Jermain Defoe was the was the penalty Taker and there was a couple of unsavory scenes where farini tracked hit the ball off and got a bit of stick for it. But brainy was the best pilot I ever seen Sunland so you should have been taking them out of the four but to for rarely missed because he had that confidence. There's no there's no exact science. Definitely think you can consider himself and Fortune, but I wouldn't personally I don't I wouldn't overthink it just because I say the next time if the balls in the game these hands I'll have no problems with that out back into school. It's innocent other no designated because then on the field it can not that it did on Tuesday, but it can sometimes lead to what looks like one Savory kind of between the players and I mean whether almost grappling for the ball and stuff and interesting, right Kyle Stewart, this actually ties in with the Netflix. We just mentioned a couple minutes ago from home. Mouth supported the club for 42 years interesting read about Copenhagen and other Danish clubs. Try changing season tickets to a Netflix style monthly subscription service. Just wonder where the sun and would look into doing this and what's your pros and cons of it would certainly suit me as a single parent with three children and I want to go over a can't afford to do it as it is and obviously have no idea whether the club would be interesting looking to do that or not, but it's interesting concept is it seems yeah, I mean from the legs I'll do other clubs perspective is year especially some I like some dormant web. Your turnover is probably in no small part based on season ticket sales. Are you leaving yourselves financially incredibly vulnerable. If you're in a situation where you could lose a big portion of your income from one month to the next and it's an interesting concept. I know it would certainly work for a lot of fans. Yeah something that balances. It's getting that balance in the kitchen. The club's perspective back could be You know, you could certainly have a lot of financial black holes opening up if you're not getting the income that you expect and you need so yes in just gone to have you know, thinking on the spot about it. So but certainly that that was the first independent my head is that financially it would be very primitive planning at the club very very difficult I suppose but I can certainly see why it would work for a lot of fans Kyle Stewart from Alec He's 33 years old has been Sun and Fun since he was five. His question is working. You see his in five years from now. When what would you like from us? I'm not sure if that's a question of the new owners possibly but Mark, I guess it's a trick once wasn't until the takeovers confirmed and they have a kind of outline their plans and their Vision but I guess the obvious answer would be primarily hopefully but it's not as easy as that either. No, of course, it's not an immediate UK. There's a host of clubs. You can look at the likes of Nottingham forest Sheffield Wednesday Legion 82. I'm sure when they were in ligue 1 if you'd asked them where they'd be in five years time. They have said the Premier League and as you say it's not as easy as it looks but you would hope obviously with the Take over if it is drugs deliver as much as fans hope that the Premier League is a realistic kind of ambition for some than in five years time. It's difficult to say though when you don't know what their plans are what kind of level of investment they're looking to bring what kind of model they wanting to put into the club. It's really difficult to predict what you would hope, you know in a Ideal World that five years time sometimes will be back in the in the top flight. We've got a couple of one of this is anonymous which we've already really answered. Will you run as we look at replaced John Ross? I think knows the answer to that one. Well, obviously, you know results are obviously dependent in any club, but but no generosity States is a secure certainly for now Kevin Deputy from Newton a cliff 51 years addicted to son and he says our fans right to question drafts at the moment in point in positions not been a bad start but we are where we are a big club and League one playing inconsistent times during all the games this season. You've kind of answered that field but anything else you'd like to answer a bit of a difficult one as I guess. It's our expectation, isn't it? Well, yeah. Yeah funds is perfectly fair question Jack Russells, though. It's the whole point football if there was no debate around it. We wouldn't be here. We wouldn't bother with it. So yeah, never criticize anyone for that. And as I've said before I would never criticize someone funds have been really really desperate to get promoted and moving the championship and and hopefully they're moving the Premier League. That's the whole point football is to push forward into To achieve big memories and happy memories and kind of push on so you can't if when it comes from that place of just really desperately wanting the club to improve and kick on then there's fair enough. I mean, the only thing I would say is that you know, I think Jack improves young players. I think he makes them better. Yes, the results have been frustrating probably this calendar year at times but he's meticulous organized incredibly hard-working is not spent a huge amount of money will grow your side. I think that transfers kind of distorted things if you look what he's trying to do, he's tried as best as possible to be targeted and bringing players who understand the club life potential who can grow who could maybe make the club some money further further down the line, so I still There's no for lot of good that he's doing at the club. I don't think it's always helpful to kind of. Sometimes it can be very very very up and down. That's just the reality of it life at a big Club. That's not always helpful in terms of having that long lens of improving the club over a long period of time and getting the culture right and that big question of how this club thrives and the divisions higher but you know, it is kind of as an alleged to before it's kind of a reality of where this clubs out and fortunately, but certainly if people you know, my own opinion would be that you know, he's the right person for it, but you can't criticize of the people with Don't have that opinion. And certainly the reality is something I have not won loads and loads and loads and loads of football matches in 2019. So that's going to create create a bit and Jack will know better than anyone that the best thing you can do is go on a little running and kind of put that to bed. Charlie muffin shoes have been on not sure if it's his exact shoes. He lives in the beautiful city question. Do you feel the three main incoming investors will want to realize change quickly or slow and steady. I think I prefer slow and steady is in our previous pursuit of Premier. League's is stability basically meant Throwing good money after bad time and time again until I eventually implosion. What properties do you think our new owners should address and in what order obviously they'll hopefully outline their priorities when they do hopefully take charge, but I guess if you obvious ones would be things like investment in the infrastructure and the academy buildings themselves at Stadium lighting the academy like which one's need a bit of TLC. Funding the academy moving forward will be another and in terms of the investment in the squad. That would be limited. Anyway wouldn't in ligue 1 in terms of the terms antigens and to be honest like one it's one of the big problems with the system. One of the reasons why Barry went South is in league one. The reality is always can find ways to spend money on players if they want to I don't think it will but the reality is you can do that in the championship. You can't you can't just throw money at it in the championship anymore. The picture has changed dramatically, but I do think as a general picture someone's You could argue a pretty fortunate to be getting a second chance at this in terms of having a lot of capital owners with it and resources to invest heavily. We had at the first time around and it was shut down the drain, you know, Ellie Shore and this isn't a personal criticism. It's just the reality is Legacy was Relatively non-existent in terms of the structures that were built the infrastructure around the ground and the culture at the club wasn't really any kind of legacy to be honest. There's a lot that we already there in terms of the buildings wasn't and the money was chucked in and I think most people would be of the belief and of the argument that it was Ellis was didn't surround yourself with the right people and that's why things got things went down the drain really so from my perspective as a globe. You should be looking at this and saying well, we've got a second chance at do what we didn't do the first time around which is build really really resilient structures that can the can last and actually produce success further down the line and make us less dependent on having to just Chuck money at players and what have you so that's my take on it. But you know, let's not pretend that wouldn't be exciting for came in and started signing. Yeah. Yeah signed big name players wouldn't be the way I went about with Anonymous wide-open seem to struggle with basic defending this will cost is going up Mark. What's your take on that? You think there's a Jack Russell obviously highlighted in the post-match John Ross took the took the blame for like draw I was gonna say the fact that if only a defeat but dropped her on Tuesday and again highlighted, excuse me, The Chronic lack of clean sheets of season. So on and of played is it 10 games in total now? We're in the league that I haven't kept a clean sheet yet and he said successful teams generally need to keep 20 or so of the league campaign. So a lot of improvements to be made. Yeah, I think Jack Ross made a valid point in his press conference when he spoke about the fact that John McLaughlin probably hasn't made as many big saved as he had by this point last season. Yeah, there was some games not just the start of last season, but across the campaign where something's got points because John McLaughlin was making some some incredible saves and he's not doing that this year but teams are maybe being a little bit more clinical and a finishing the chances they are. Getting and I think it's just momentary lapses sometimes, you know, you look at Tuesday night and it was just you know, the failure to clear kind of one one balls a hasty and you know, he doesn't make a mistake from that kind of range. It's something that needs to be addressed because when while they're not keeping clean sheets, they you know, they're already needing the score two goals to win and you know, the created enough chances to score two on on Tuesday night, but if you've got a you know, if you just have that kind of bad look, You're not going to not going to find the back of the net more than once you need to be able to rely on your back line keeping those clean sheets, which at the moment some of them can't so it's something I'm sure Jack Ross obviously is a former. Defender himself will be Keen to address and hopefully once they get that first clean sheet that just gives them that little bit of confidence that little bit of a reminder that you know, maybe does not an error in as and they can push on a little bit and maybe not hit that 20 Mark now, but hopefully maybe get up and around that and start taking the burden off the strikers a little bit I guess so his acceptance of the games will be more open given the formation system some of the plane and even upper body image is it it's a strange one in that. Obviously. I know Jax obviously right in clean sheets in it a massive difference having said that the last kind of if you're back to the Portsmouth came the way someone to set up the formation of played the style of played think it's pretty difficult to keep clean sheets playing that way. Mmm plane to very very Orthodox trait is to Wing is not wide midfielders. Let's get a right, you know Linda need in a knot. You failed as they are Wing as they tend not to do a huge amount going back either way. So I think it's very difficult to keep clean sheets and that environment and that isn't a massive concern for me if they keep creating a number of chances they have in the last few games, but because I just I just think you can focus too much on the Inland defend individuals in that sense. I think at the moment someone to play in the way that makes it pretty difficult to keep clean cheek to be honest. And I don't necessarily I don't even really say that as a criticism. I think they look at the other night. They try to win the game. Game and didn't want to draw a game 1-1. They chucked a lot of players on I as I said before, I think they could have handled the situation better. But the reality is the deliberately it was a very very open game. So so can it's a tough conundrum to solve. I mean, I guess Bonds in Luton were pretty attacking last year and played two Strikers and we're able still to still to keep clean sheets. So it definitely can be done some something needs to be done. But you know if switch have only conceded for girls which is why they are where they are, but I don't think the players expansive someone do they're very direct. So yeah, it's an interesting interesting conundrum of interesting is they have Jack tries to try to solve and in the coming weeks as you say McGuire why kind of great girl came off the bench didn't choose nice and must be one of the strongest benches. Only one recent years. It was a strong strong options From. The Bench are Peter Forsythe from Clayton is supported summoned for approaching 60 years. His question is given the misfiring of week and Grigg misfiring. Although it was probably a bit harsh on on why colder thought given these I got a couple thousand already this season miss one game for the suspension and with All due respect the current Striker coaches would be possible to bring in it for a short period of Specialists strike a coach or foremost traps top Striker to work with the from guys to improve their finishing. Thanks Peter. I mean something that's got quite a lot of goals this season. I would question whether that's the main issue for the club as you've already discussed in depth. It's probably more getting that balance right the other end of the pitch. Yeah. I mean, you know, you got the out and getting the compound composure in the final third was was outstanding all three girls real quality Lynn. Just the well Greg conundrum. Is this one night? It's quite something. I don't have the answer to it's difficult to work out of than the say of it. It's performance this for a while now coming off the bench have been. Okay. So that makes you think the truly the girls will follow and I'm going to pretend I have the answer to that particular puzzle. Paul parking from Durham and now living in Cyprus. I'll just read all this out. It's more of a comment regarding than a question but a support the lad since 1973 and his dad took me to the junction of the A1 M and A 692 watch them and bring home the FA Cup in an open-top bus. He was eight years old at the time you started going to games with his friends at the age of 13 and starting his own son a rocker Park when he was five years old. We'll watch The Lads wherever we can the last games Akron in the cup game a couple of weeks back Jack Ross is right about the negativity around the clubhouse. Don't you think that plays need to take responsibility for doing something about that on the pitch? Can you really blame supporters who have endured years of disappointment last season's fairly to get promoted in the Wembley defeat is it not for chat Ross on the players to show some show some grit on the pitch and they give the funds something positive and consistent to shout about we don't seem to be able to play two half of the same way against rather. It was great until the penalty missing then terrible other sports psychologists doing enough re the confidence and the resilience a lot of interesting. Points raised there by Paul obviously just on the negativity show. I guess it works both ways. Doesn't the players have got to give the fans something to cheer about and generally I would argue that I've done over the last 15 months or so. Yeah. I mean they've delivered two trips to Wembley, which is you know would have been Unthinkable a few years ago to get two trips to Wembley within the space of kind of three months. Obviously. It's unfortunate the circumstances that come in in terms of sudden and being in League one, but yeah, pause definitely got some some valid points that the players have got to do to deliver. I think that as you say large about the last 15 months they have and I think it's easy and isolation to take results and not necessarily blow them out of proportion. But Focus maybe a little bit too much on on one negative result or one negative aspect of someone's performance is rather than looking at the Grand picture that the club is in a far far better place than it was 15 months ago with players that want to be here and do want to do their best for Sun and Anonymous has been prolific this week's been back on their album. Second half shows we are crying out for Leadership on the pitch. How do we again have a captain that isn't a regular starter and Grant little bit and Chris Maguire were obviously dropped out of the bench for the game on Tuesday. Although McGwire has had a slight ankle issue, which I think you picked up against Pete Brittany. What did he miss the people game unless it's a bit of a game with that and then played against Akron and John Ross didn't felt he was fully able to start a second game in quick succession Grant little bit. He was Keen to just mix things up a little bit in that area of the pitch. We talked a lot about the way rather than rather than play. This was a bit of an issue wasn't the first couple weeks we'll add bit but then he did get a fairly lengthy running the team. Is it important to always have the captain start? No, I don't mean the captain seemed that isn't football at all here. Especially my this is my opinion of the people who disagree I don't think it can seem like some football or it's quite odd places on in the could comfortably wear that and then it wouldn't be you know, this there was plenty of leadership in terms of experience. And what have you on the pitch for that last however long yeah, I don't add for me. It's completed. Servants who has the am band and who who has on the pitch at the time? I don't think it makes any difference whatsoever. I'd only you could see it wasn't enough leadership or experience on that pitch in the last 20 minutes. Yeah, as I've said, I don't think performance was great. I think it could have been handled North lot better and I don't know you could say there wasn't enough experience or enough people who should have leadership skills and my you know, even the gate he's played in the played in the championship. Yeah, one of the biggest clubs in the world for a long time. So yeah it just on Ledbetter himself. I mean he's Threes and these dreams realities not he's not going to play three games in a week. It's it's not sustainable to expect that. You know, it's going to be a long long season. You don't want like the burning out or not being able to contribute in the last couple months to seize and when I might be really tense and difficult games, that's when you want someone like him on the pitch. So and WX had a good season so far choose night probably wasn't his best showing of the Season having said that I didn't you do did great deal wrong, and he looks really good player. So, I think that's a good position to be and where you can drop Grand on the bench every now and then get some get some rest in him and you've got to play a similar blue and come in execute the same role really. Well, that's it's a healthy position to be in not a not a but not negative 1 well under this John from Sutherland 58 supported us for as long as he can remember and he says he said room is the new tale of a team would like to expand the seating capacity by building extra seats at the stadium. Is there any truth in this it was certainly the case wasn't with my Campbell's takeover bid. That was one of their potential plans. Extend the capacity of the stadium of Light which they felt they could do quite quickly which are things which I think is the case isn't with the stadium like that. If there was the need to do that. You can expand it relatively easy as these things go as I said, we we haven't heard from well the deal isn't done yet until it's done. So we are now from the new owners yet as to what their plans will be, but I would be surprised if that will be a priority and imagine it might well be on the list, but imagine it would be very early. Fairly low down the opportunity is still not working on normal match this exactly what quite lonely up there and prestes any minute good stuff.

Welcome to Bevin FM over 40 and her friends podcast. This is me, Bevin. I've said my name three times. It's time to start the show. I'm so excited that you've tuned in welcome today. I'm going to talk about some big stuff going on. So first of all, I want to talk about some big changes happening in my life. And I'm going to talk about some of the key learnings that I got when I took a social media Hiatus for four months. So first and foremost I am Announce this at the top of the last episode that I am moving next month this month. I'm moving in three weeks. Basically I am getting rid of 85% of what I own. This is a made-up estimate of this is just based on how much space I have available to me to store my possessions for when I get another place to live that as my own. But basically I am subleasing a tiny house down the street from my mom and because it's like TurnKey, right? Please I will show up with me my cat which is the most important thing is that I get to keep my cat all of his needs and he's a special needs cats. He's got a lot of meds and things he needs all of my toiletries, which is not a small than ever. It's not small situation. My mom gave me this toiletries carrying case once it's like truly for like full-size bottles of things and it has proved I was it was in the giveaway pile until I realize I was moving and then I pulled it out of the giveaway pile because I like actually this is gonna be my bathroom for the next six months because it's going to store all of my full-size products because you know, she this is a I believe in natural beauty, but I also believe in doing what you need to do to take great care of yourself and I take great care of myself. And so all my bathroom stuff is just when then closed just like season will close because I'm moving someplace that has a proper fall proper winter proper Cold Spring and I'm moving very close to the border of Canada. Actually I can see Canada from Tiny house. I've never actually looked at the view intentionally from this house that I'm renting but I have looked extensively At This Woman's Garden. So I'm actually really excited to go and get to just like really get intimate with that that space I yeah, so like and then I'll probably bring some jigsaw puzzles and some art to work on in the winter, but my plan is to move into this tiny house have my living expenses basically reduced. Bye. It's like whatever 5/6 is in percent. I'm going down five six and how much my living expenses are maybe even more than that because you know the power bills and the water bills at a house that has a front yard and backyard or not a joke. So anyway, I'm just like basically doing a fire sale of all of my belongings. I have found just you know, so far Craigslist is over. It's all about Facebook Marketplace. And since I've been selling on Facebook Marketplace things have been Really quickly. I was trying to sell a bunch of stuff on Craigslist before because I didn't really want all my friends in my business. And now I realize that was foolhardy. I should have been selling on Facebook all along but you know, I kind of like how I got to the decision is really like, I think I know I think I just needed to really give it a shot to stay in La I prayed for guidance and in May I was just like praying for guidance. Like what's my next step? And what do I do? And do I need to stay in LA or do I leave LA and I got the guidance that I needed to stay in La for at least six months and November 1st will be six months from right about when that decision came through. So where that call came through and so that seems about right. I have no reason to stay in La like nothing is keeping me here. I tried so hard to get a job. I tried so hard to get a roommate. I tried so hard at short-term rentals of my extra room my house and just like nothing gel. Thing came to fruition. I had a lot of last-minute Miracles that made me able to pay my rent for the last six months and just like barely ich by I've been eating on less than five dollars a day and when you're mostly trading all of your time for money eating I'm less than five dollars a day is not decadent and it's hard like because I can eat pretty well on a budget if I have time to cook, but if I don't have time to cook then it's a lot of like rice-based meals and which is fine like and five dollars a day. Is still a lot actually for a lot of people's food budgets and but like, you know, when you can't have convenience food or convenience food isn't really available to you and your in your your time schedule it like it's just I feel like I've been incomplete survival mode for the last six seven months and I'm tired and I can't do it anymore like and there is nothing in La that's keeping me here in order to pay these exorbitant rents. And like I just can't afford to keep this house in this house was like why I want to too Stay in La I was like, I'll stay here if I can stay in this really awesome house that I love so much. So it's like it feels in many ways like my therapist. Who by the way, I'm so sad. I don't get to keep my therapist because it's like we do remote sessions over the phone, but he's licensed in California and he won't get a Washington license just to counsel me. So I'm hopeful that we can have a little Bridge time. So I don't just like move and have no therapy support because therapy is actually been really helpful for me. But he did remind me before before I made this decision like in that last week where I was like, what's the miracle going to be? How am I going to pay this rent? And he was like you were in this situation because of your breakup. This is not a personal failure of yours. This is just a circumstance of where your life has been and you can't blame yourself for it which like I'm a Capricorn. It's my it's my nature to blame myself for everything and every shortcoming and so I've recently learned that one of the best things that Capricorn Do is adopt some of those Leo characteristics where Leo's are really about like being proud of their accomplishments and like knowing how far they've come and I think as a Capricorn, you know, it's the symbol of that goat climbing up the mountain and sometimes I get really caught up with where the next point and the mountain is instead of turning around and looking at how far I've come and I'm really proud of myself for making it work as long as I did and I'm really proud of myself for like continuing to connect with other human beings. Beings create Circles of people around me who are supportive of the mindsets. I want to have and like who I'm becoming in my life and seeking out spiritual Community here in La when I knew that was lacking after my breakup and you know, really giving it a shot and I've Loved this town and like I was driving Rideshare. I was doing lift as a driver for a long time like 50 60 hour weeks doing lift and I Even make my ends meet working that hard and that is really sad and I think it just kind of goes to show how underpaid Rideshare drivers are by the way always tip your driver like always it's a thing. It's like it's like you tip at a restaurant tip your driver the take-home pay from lift. By the way, if you're thinking of doing it is about 10 bucks an hour before taxes after expenses and before tips. So just just so you know, that's what the person's making who's driving around. They are not making I made about thirty percent of every Fair which like lift. I don't know. There's something someone Googled in the back of my left base of well on Google. It says blah blah blah, but I want you to remind I want to remind you that I mean and maybe it's just true in La that they're taking about 75% off the top but about 7075 percent. It's so bananas. Sometimes I'll drive someone and I'll make two dollars and sixty two cents and they spent $10 on that red. It is cuckoo anyway, so just to say tip your Rideshare drivers and it's not Is sustainable income and less you can work 50 to 60 hours a week and even then kind of depending on how heavy expenses are I still have like basically I'm listening to what my body says and my body told me I couldn't drive Rideshare anymore. Like I have this ongoing muscle ache that's in the full back of my leg and my foot is still pretty injured the my driving foot. So it's just from like that. Stop start. Stop start mom traffic e days, so I gave it a shot. I can safely I really tried to be an ally and it wasn't even like I was trying to be an actress or something like that something. That was La specific. I was just trying to like keep the great house that I loved and try to like thrive in this life that was set up for me when I had a partner whose business made over a hundred fifty thousand dollars a year and I helped her build that business and you know, it is what it is. Like wish we wish we had gotten married and I got alimony, but kind of glad we didn't get married so that this can just be over. And so now I depart la for the border of Canada. I'm going to live down the street from my mother which I'm actually really excited about I love my mom. She and I have the best relationship we've had in our whole lives. Like I think that's due in large part to both of us having a lot of personal growth. I also she also recently sent me her astrological chart and you really know you're cool with me if I'm like. Hey, what's your birth data so I can look up your astrological chart and so like learning more about my mom's stuff and how like that it just it all made sense. Once I saw it. I was like, oh my God a Sagittarius moon. Oh my God, right like my mom is amazing. And I'm glad to just get the opportunity to see what it's like to live down the street from her. I've never had that experience. I always kind of thought it was weird when people stayed in the same town as their parents because like I moved away when I was 17 years old. I have not ever lived at home again, and I'm technically not living at home because I didn't grow up where my mom lives now. She retired up to the Olympic National Forest. She literally lives in the forest and a little tiny village. And so and most of the people leave during the winter. So it's going to be really isolated. I'm hoping to get a great job that like pays my bills and that I can leave at work and I'm going to keep building. I have a couple businesses obviously, you know about faka dance party aerobics, which is my aerobics class that I created for everybody who's left behind by mainstream Fitness and it hasn't been something I can devote a ton of time on lately. So I've been needing to trade my time for money and the business is not at a point where it can support me financially full-time. So I've been focusing mostly just on my online Pursuits with it. So I've been online weekly aerobics class that you can get through. My patreon patreon is a membership site. It's like crowdfunding meets a membership subscription and for 25 bucks a month. You can take my weekly online aerobics best. And so that has been what I've been Focusing on because I want it to be able to reach as many people as possible. And this was before I even was thinking that I was going to move away. But now I'm glad like I've been investing in that so that is still ongoing. Its I've never stopped. I've been doing this class every week for the last like since I launched in January, so keep on teaching was online or hybrid class join me anytime you get four classes available to you every month of different lengths. So there's a 10-minute a 20-minute a 45 Minute and a 60 Minute class and I love doing it. I love teaching aerobics the other day. I taught my last La class for a while to a couple of my regulars from LA and it was just like I was like, I love teaching this class. I love doing this. Yeah, and I also have my online workout videos which so funny because my I think the episode 4 is about spirituality and I talked at length about Kyle cease and how his stuff has really he's like a teacher Guru. And he's really taught me a lot just by being a member of his absolutely everything community and I was I got picked to be on his weekly call which is kind of a big deal and I got picked from my question which it was like basically, how do I know when it's time to quit like, I'm really working hard to stay in this house, but everything seems like it's not working and he didn't actually answer my question, but he like loved the fact that dance party stuff and he loved Frankie dance party and he was like you have to do this. Have to share this like blah blah blah. So I'm also really not interested in having investors. So it's like something that's got to be built on the side. So I've got that I am intending to continue sharing back a dance party and figuring out what's next but trying to work smarter not harder because I spent a lot of time the last couple of years like when I had the privilege of having someone paying my rent then I'm grateful that I was able to build it, but I was able to kind of try a lot of stuff and screw up a lot of stuff and like make mistakes and I didn't have a mentor helping me like build it because I was just kind of making it up and like figuring stuff out and like that's I really just saw lack of mentorship in my life like affecting like how I was able to move it forward and now yeah, so now like I see because of the people I got connected to and the the learnings I've done in the last six months staying in La I like I see clearly why To be here for this time. And also I just don't see staying which is sad because like there are some some people that I did get connected to who are like phenomenal and I would love friends if we talk on my offline. I will tell you all about it, but basically like changed the course of my life changed the trajectory really helping me move some specific personal gross stuff and I'm going to aggressively work to pay off debt. I haven't fully totaled all of my debt, but I think my debt is in the neighborhood of $150,000. Out of which is student debt left over from a law degree. I don't even use anymore because I you know, just. Lawyers have four times the national rate of suicide and I am not interested in being a lawyer. So I that proved out to me every single time. I've had a lot of job. I've been more suicidal then when I don't and the last time I had a nine-to-five la job which you know, a lot of job is like more like I would say it's like 9 to 9 and every time I was communicating to that I was on the subway. This is when I was in New York and I would just contemplating suicide was contemplating jumping on the track every time and I never equated like oh this bullying environment that's like argumentative environment and never equated that to like my mental health and why I was having those ideations and now I just like have way more of an awareness of myself. And so anyway, I don't know what industry I'm going to go into. I'm just keeping an open mind and looking for that and like working on building a whole nother business. This that I'm not even public about and that is my retirement plan and my hope is to retire up where my mom lives and my hope is to retire in the next few years. And you know, that doesn't mean I'll ever stop doing that dance party because I think that's my heart work and I think that's where I meant to serve on a global scale and help sort of shift The Narrative around dance aerobics and fat people Fitness and fat people. And also I'd love it. I love doing dance aerobics and I love sharing it with people. And I want to you know live to be supported but I don't I would love to be supported by faculty and party aerobics and I haven't like fully like given up. Hope on that but I'm certainly not like hinging on it because there's just so many things that go into whether or not a business is profitable. And so I'm going to get a bill paying job keep working on my retirement business and keep pushing forward FAQ a dance party. That is also a specific question that I was asked by a friend when I was catching. Hang up today is like what are you doing effective dance party? So rest assured I will still be filming my weekly classes probably with some of my mom's retirement buddies. Hopefully being in the background of my videos and them probably I don't know that I can record aerobics in a tiny house, but they have like a lodge that I can probably use and anyway, so I'm excited to share with you from there. And obviously I'm going to continue doing this podcast and so you'll hear it. About my life. And yeah, so I'm excited about just the possibilities obviously like opening up for me because I'm willing to make so much change. This is a thing I've learned from Kyle sees is that whenever you're stuck or whenever things are really frustrating just do the opposite of the thing you were doing before. So in this instance, I've lived Urban my entire adult life since I was 20, I think 20 I Go to Philadelphia and I've lived in Philly and New York City and Los Angeles and I before that lived in suburbs and so I have never lived rural in my whole life. So I'm literally going to be living. I'm on the very edge of like the little village that my mom is in. So I'm like in the farthest corner lot. And so I'm like, wow, I'm like literally going to be like facing the forest all day long. Like what's that going to be? Like am I going to fully become Snow White will the mice and the bunny? And the deer and the birds follow me around and I just going to sing songs to them. This is like I'm really kind of picturing. My life is some some sort of weird hybrid between like like Disney princess and a small town CW plot like, you know divorce a former lawyer moves boomerangs to her mom's retirement community lives in the woods. The closest town is like 9,000 people and Like how maybe I'll meet a lonely widower who needs to learn about the spirit of Christmas or something. I don't know. Like I just like have to be positive about it because like optimism is the price of entry for being an entrepreneur and believing in yourself and like honestly like I would prefer to be optimistic then depressed and that's my other option and I'm not taking it because I am moving forward. I am already planning to get my seasonal affective disorder lamp. I've already started dosing myself. Stuff with vitamin D three times a day. I'm ready to pry myself for self-care because I want to see what it's like for me to just Thrive instead of having to be in survival mode. I've been in survival mode. Like honestly like Dara sent me this shitty awful email blaming me for everything wrong in our relationship a year ago like a year and change ago. We just hit that year mark up a few days ago and I'm like, wow, my life has been like upside down like my wedding got cancelled like everything has been upside down. For a year, I am over it. I am ready to just keep moving forward and like like I feel like in the last few months just like since she withdrew her support financially for me. I've just been like sinking into debt and like not getting ahead and I'm tired of it like I want to thrive and so it's kind of like when I moved to LA and I was like, ooh, what will my life be like when I don't have to fight seasonal affective disorder and live in New York City for six months a year because it really just felt like I was like trying to just Just basically feel okay and instead of like thriving and then in La like I got to focus all that stuff care. I'm just thriving and I worked I love living in LA and I've really bloomed here. But I think this will be even better like having less money demands on my life and like being so in with nature, I think that I can Thrive even more and I'm excited to see what what that looks like. So stay tuned. I will keep you updated. We're going to take a quick music. Jake and then we'll be right back. So West Coast wave goddess some were chilling on the balcony on the beach mobile some Haze. I woke up on the island feeling Grand. I'm the queen of this Lane Highway weeks.

Okay, welcome back. That was Lizzie Jeff with ladybug free a recent drop. I was introduced to Lizzie Jeff by Ashley Manta who is who introduced me to Deidre Bliss who was in my last episode. So I feel like this is like all part of this beautiful Nexus of blowing goddesses. I'm really stoked about it. I love Lizzie Jeff stuff. Okay, so I wanted to talk about like the That's of deciding to leave Los Angeles and like my perspective on it. I think that some may perceive or I guess there's a pot like there's a way to look at it where I failed to thrive in La like I didn't, you know do the thing. I couldn't support myself and I you know, I went at length and episode 2 about like what I learned from allowing myself to be supported by my partner and a lot of people have told me not to be so hard on myself. Elf and again hashtag Capricorn problems like it's hard for me not to take personal responsibility because I really truly believe that I am the creator of my own life and I think I really needed for my heart and for my maybe even my ego. I just needed to like really give La a shot and really try to do it myself. If I was meant to be here and I tried really hard. I tried everything I could to get a roommate or job. If either of those things had come through I probably wouldn't need to leave la Um, but it's so interesting that it neither did and I really never look at things as failures or I work hard to not look at things as failures. I work hard to perceive my failures as lessons because I think when you fail at something it is a lesson that you are doomed to repeat if you choose not to learn the lesson or even look at it or examine it and so for me, I feel like it's such a great lesson such a good learning and also I don't think that That I failed at anything. I think this is just like I thought that you know staying in La was probably what was meant for me and like turns out that's not what was meant to happen. And I don't feel like moving down the street from my mom is like anything but an awesome next step in my life like I moving out here and getting to live so close to my grandmother for the last year of her life, which I didn't know was her last year was such an opportunity that like I knew That my next up after Allah or even like actually had visioned for myself to live part-time near my mom and live up there. So it seems interesting that now like it's just not exactly how I decided it was going to be it's just what is happening. And what's it kind of like my path of least resistance, right? Like I didn't have enough money to pay rent and I like have to borrow the money in order to move and getting into further debt, which I don't want. But you know, it does mean that I can like start sort of turning the ship around a lot swifter because these fences are just so much lower up there. I've also you know what I'm excited to do something different than what I've been doing right like so I get to do the opposite of what I've been doing which I think will accelerate my personal growth and I also am just like kind of excited to see what happens with my life and what's possible for me out of all of this and And you know, I think life does get to be as easy as it can be. I think there really is a path of least resistance often that were ignoring because we're so used to things of value needing to be work and that's like a capitalist mindset where your productivity measures your worth or your results measure you're worth but I think I'm worthy no matter what I also think. You're worthy. No matter what you were the exactly as you are and I just don't feel like I have anything To prove right? Like I'm I know no matter what I'm going to keep growing and I'm going to keep being an awesome badass and I'm going to get better at being me every year. I'm going to become a more exalted and authentic version of myself. I'm going to have more joy and more spirit because I'm continuing to step forward on my journey and learn the lessons that come my way. I heard recently that like 90% of life gets to be easy and 10% are these like Necessary lessons we have to learn and and that's like a spiritual perspective on life and struggle and I think anything worth doing is worth fighting through resistance. And anytime you're doing something great. Like that's when resistance flares but most if you haven't read the book The War of art, I really recommend it. My mentors have me reading some books and really looking at resistance in the role of resistance in life. And I have decided there's like two areas where I'm willing to run a pill and and that's you know, building business and personal growth, but I don't think I need to run uphill in every area of my life and it is like just the way that things kind of came together for me to move down the street from my mom like this house was available and like my mom had a storage space that she was subletting to someone else who like literally like when I needed when I had made the Declaration like I think I need to move my My mom was like my mom's friend was like, oh we're leaving the storage space. So it's like all lining up super well and super easily and like I feel super grateful for like the work that my mom has done to help me line this stuff up, but also my mom downsized within the last few years, so she had wisdom to offer me one of my besties also downsized or like kind of combine households with her partner or fiance and now I've you know, she was like telling me on the phone the other day. She's like, I hope this isn't super bossy and I'm like no you've literally done exactly what I'm trying to do. Please tell me how you've done this because like I think in life often, we take the opinions of strangers really seriously, like we're really concerned about what other people think I'm really only concerned about the opinions of people who have done what I want to be doing, right? So she has successfully sold a bunch of stuff from downsizing. I want that. My mom has successfully downsized her life into a place where she doesn't need a big George unit, right so she has fruit on that treat. So I'm taking advice from those people. And anyways, I think it's just important to like have a good perspective on my life and like why I'm making the choices. I'm making I feel super happy. Actually that I had the experience of Summer of going on a full social media Hiatus. I have been producing content like personal content online like personal narrative since 2002, so Had a Blog since then various incarnations, but like have been public on the internet since pretty much you could be and then the summer or the spring summer. I went off social media was just too became really toxic for me. It was my mental health was suffering deeply not just because of that but because of circumstances of my life C episode 2 and I needed to take a break I needed to do something different. I really really really love social media. I think social media gives us access to a At form and it gives us access not only us as creators access to platforms. But I think social media also gives us as consumers access to mindsets and connections to people that are really powerful and can really powerfully impact our life. I think that one of the most toxic things we consume is our media TV shows commercials apps, all of these things can be incredibly toxic and can be incredibly degrading to Our sense of self to our empowerment to who were meant to be in this world, right? And if you're spending any time at all paying attention and I use that term very specifically you are paying attention because you have two primary resources in your life time and money and when you spend your time paying attention to someone that's a real thing like that's value that you're giving with your attention, right? So you're allowing someone to have impact on you and if they are making you feel The shitty if they are making you feel less than if you are like deeply in compare and despair and it might not even be that person's fault. It may just be your toxic interaction with that person, right? Because like you're triggered by that person and you're getting into this feedback loop step away take a like unfollow anybody that makes you feel less than unfollow. Anybody that does not help inspire you to be your most confident self and and it may not even have to do with the content. They're creating. It may just have to do with like the way you're in. Acting with them as a person and you just need to take a break in that's okay, but there are tons of people out there who are who are really pumping out kindness and inspiration and joy, and that's why I like to ask my guests on the show who they're following on Instagram who they love because I want you to be able to have ideas of people that you can connect to who can sew into your life and who can help you sort of raise your vibration and become the best version of yourself, which is what I want for you and also PS thanks for tuning. Me into my podcast. Thank you for paying attention to me. I really appreciate it. And I'd love sharing this stuff and it's helpful to like have people who were listening because if it's a if I'm just like recording audio on my house and don't have an audience. That's not really a podcast. Right? So what I realized I took a social media Hiatus because I saw the toxic impact on my life and I was like I need to do something else. So what I started doing with all that time because I realized so I'd love social media right? Like I love it. I only follow Go who I love I only like I'm constantly like evaluating. Do I love this person? Are they adding value to me? Like right like so anybody who says that they feel shitty after scrolling social media too long. I mean, I think number one like so much scrolling, right? Like I don't think it's good for you but never to like follow people that Vibe you up and make you feel great, right like dipping in and out of Instagram can be something that makes you feel better about the world because you're curating your own media feed. You're not letting CBS or NBC make Asians about what you're listening to that's that was a bygone era and now we have way more personal autonomy when it comes to what we're consuming. So instead of being on social media, I you know cuz you can't just take something out you need to replace it. So I replaced it with an hour of meditation everyday I have was on social media probably creating content for about an hour a day and then consuming content for about 3 hours a day. It was bananas at my height. And so When I went off social media I had more time. So I was meditating an hour. I also like was working at a time. So it was helpful because I was driving Rideshare so much. I was basically just talking to real people in real life and making real connections with them rather than like just having the social media thing which like I think social media is good for Content similar to reading a book or watching a television show. I do not think it's good for social and human connection. I think human connection actually requires a connection. AKA get on the phone with people. I was also replacing it with phone calls. I have talked to so many of my friends on the phone and the last few months. It's amazing. I can tell a significant difference between my mood on a day when I've talked to three to four to five people on the phone then just 0 to 2. There's death. I just like that human interaction that human connection cannot be duplicated. I think be a digital means it's not texting. It's not sending DMC on Instagram it is Only talking on the telephone or having a video chat conversation with someone. I've all the eyeball voice The Voice something like that. That isn't meaningful human connection humans are a tribal species. That means that we thrive on social connection. It's actually really vital to us. And when I was on my social media Hiatus, I had a friend send me an article that said social isolation kills and I was just like wow that's deep and hard but I am definitely still getting my social interaction just in a Different more low-key way and and actually, you know what? It was really fulfilling like not being on social media like and having those human connections kind of replace these like fo connections that I thought were real human connections was like eye-opening in terms of just like how humans Thrive I have really been challenging myself to talk to strangers more and more, you know, kind of beefed up by the great conversations and connections. I had through lift, but also like just Maybe some sunshine and people's lives like sometimes when you talk to someone at the grocery store you maybe be the only person that person is talk to you today. And I think it's awesome to just like give someone a compliment. I think Compliments are a free thing. You can do that make people feel awesome and I highly recommend complimenting on things that are non physical appearance related things like oh I like your shirt. Where did you get it right like something really specific about what you like about someone about how they are. In the world or like, you know, I don't know whatever talk to strangers. It's not going to it's nobody ever died of awkward and like if I view up but that's the long and the short of that but I really started just like challenging myself to do new social things and that was really good and it was harder for me to like see my friends because I was working so much mostly like when I was working for left, I was like doing self care and working and that was it because like I had a better driving day if I'm Agitated and I definitely never would feel comfortable driving people in a car unless I had a full night's sleep. So those are two like primary huge self-care things that they needed to do. So something I also did while I was on my social media Hiatus is I created a second Instagram account. That was just like a secret account that I used to consume just a very small number. I'm talking like 5 to 10 people on social media and the reason why I Did that it's a weirdest thing. I started missing John Mayer. So John Mayer grammy-winning a recording artist. You probably have heard his stuff. He's very famous. He I got introduced to him because of Andy Cohen who's like the Bravo host the executive producer of The Real Housewives and Andy. I don't know. I just started watching Watch What Happens Live? I really liked him read his book superficial and I I just like really Next John Mayer just based on how Andy talked about him. So then I started falling on him on social media and I actually like really deeply admire him as an artist like he has an amazing art practice. Like he's a brilliant guitar player really good songwriter and like deeply connected to emotions. I've also looked up his birth chart. So his Mars is in cancer if that means anything to you, but that means that your work in the world is about feelings. So Mars is your work. what the sign of cancer is all about feels and so anyway, so he just has a really good Lyricist way of connecting to feelings and I yeah, I also like he's I think studied comedy or at least like has at least been a student of Comedy because he's very funny and like you can tell like he's like working in refining on that and any artist who learns like it's basically like an art hack right like a Mastery hack like when you've got an area of Mastery and you Start exploring other artistic Expressions outside of that mean expression it it actually makes the main expression stronger. I think it's something to do with brain science. I read it in a book and so like anyway, and also if he's funny and he makes me laugh out loud and I specifically need more people in my life who make me laugh out loud, like I'm 40, like I don't have time to have a boring life anymore. Like I want mirth enjoyment and dad Joe. Jokes, you know what I mean and like so I'm just I'm here for you. I'm here for people who make me laugh. And so then I just I enjoyed follow him on social media because he regularly makes me laugh out loud because I admire his artistic practice and enjoy a consuming his art. Like I'm now a big fan like it's funny because like his social media got me listening to his music more now, I love it and I just like found myself like in like month one of my social media Hiatus curious have John Mayer You know what? I mean, and I'm like wow, this is interesting of all the people I follow on social media and it's like more than a thousand on my main account which is at Bevins party. If you don't follow me yet. I was like Wow John Mayer, huh? So like I just I'm also an artist who follows her Curiosities. I think Curiosities are the way God sort of leads us to things and so I decided I was like, okay if I'm curious about John Mayer, why don't I like you know, like Go see what he's up to. So I logged into like my side account and just like followed him followed like a couple other entrepreneurs who like have what I want and like I said like you take advice from people who have the fruit on the tree that you want. And so I followed my leek teal who is an amazing boss CEO and just really good and resilient about what other people think she Preaches a lot about being patient with the process and really just like her podcast is also Top Notch really recommend a follow to that. I also followed Gary Vee who is this prolific content creator. Once you see the amount of content, he has that every time I'm like, oh my God, he's putting out so much content. I remind myself. He is a 30-person Content creation team, which means he's like not effing around about creating content, but he preaches optimism and patients all the time which are very crucial characteristics of any entrepreneur and I needed those reminders because like, you know, you don't have any control over like the market and how things go you only have control over your work product and it is your work product is very very dependent on your perspective and I really needed people to remind me to be optimistic and patient. And so I started following them. I started following like a couple of my close friends who have babies. Is because like they're like minutes pass and they get bigger like it is so bananas when you like have kids in your life who are growing. I love being an aunt and I love connecting two kids and I really appreciate my friends who share their babes on social media so that I can see them grow up like kind of minute by minute. It's yeah, it's just like something I was really missing like seeing my little nieces and nephews and so I was like, I want to see them so I started end. It up. I ended up like following like maybe 10 people but the best part about it was that my feed would end like you can scroll through and it's done. So if you only follow 10 people and I'm not saying like you have to get a whole new account for this you could dump everybody on yours and only follow 10 people, but I think it's super potent to be consuming everything someone's pumping out like because that's a person who has what you want and that's why you're connecting with them. And so it was great because like 15 minutes and that was it. So I was And out in 15 minutes. It did not drag me down. It actually Amplified me and helped me feel better in life. And but also not consumed by her connected to social media too much and now that I'm back on social media. I oh and also one more thing I wanted to say about that. It's so you are truly influenced by The Five People You spend the most time with it really shapes who you are and I really curate who those people are in my life. Life as soon as Darren I broke up. I worked really hard for her to drop out of that top five because she is so fear-based and like I knew that how much fear she had and like scarcity mentality. She had I knew that was affecting me and I knew it even while we were together, but I just loved her too much and I was too committed to our relationship to like critique that or try to take her out of my top five, right? I wouldn't marry someone who I wouldn't want my top 5, but now I see it and I'm like, oh I like just needed to get that negativity out of my head and I needed to get that like worry some sort of stress ball stuff away from me. So I worked really hard to like curate my top 5 and who's influencing me and I think you can do that with people who you were not directly like in a relationship with right like they don't have they can be your friends. Like if you are like sitting around with one of your besties all the time, or like if you're a parent and you have Current friends who are like friends of your kids that you don't really like that much but you're spending time with them because your kids are together like those people are affecting you but I think that if you put some time into it and intention into it, you can be influenced in a similar Way by people who are content creators or artists or whatever. I really got into consuming everything that one person would put out. Like if someone had a podcast I might just listen to that whole podcast or listen to them regularly. Like every week so so Kyle sees is someone I very intentionally making my top five because he has what I want. He's happy. He's fulfilled. He's living a life of impact and he's financially I wouldn't call him financially independent, but he's pretty close like and so yeah, so like being part of his absolutely everything past community and being on his weekly calls, like that's just a way that he is like sowing into me his beliefs and perspective and allowing me to kind of absorb that and and put it into practice in my life. And so yeah and like also like artists who you if you're an artist and you don't have artist whose practices you respect that you are trying to have in your top five. Like I you're not going to necessarily grow as an artist like you need people who are helping you grow if you want to grow in life, and if you don't want to grow in life life is just going to keep kicking your ass until you decide that growth is what you want from. Actually, that's it's just my my wisdom and like, you know, sometimes you're not even noticing the life ask his ass kicking because you're just used to it like this is just how life is sometimes life kicks you in the ass most of the time this is where that 90/10 thing comes in. I really truly believe and this is Bevin having lived through a year where it was not 90/10. It does not have not had 90% He's and ten percent resistance. It has been kind of more of the other way around but you know, they in spiritual communities they call it. The Dark Night of the Soul when you're really like having to grow through some stuff and I've had to grow through some stuff but I'm grateful to feel like it's on the other side because like just choose to believe that I don't have I don't have anything that I got a lot of packing I still gotta do get a lot of decluttering to do but I'm just believing for it. I'm trying to just be in that mindset that everything is happening for a reason and that I am you know Be less depressed because I am focusing on human connection having at least like five real human connections every day. And yeah, like really just and that's going to be a challenge living rurally and like I'm glad that I had the practice of a social media Hiatus so that I can know what it's like for me to like change radically how we interact with humans and also just have that data about me that having five kids. Connections in a day really does help me stay a little antidepressant right? And you know, since I've been back on social media, I think I've been back for like a month and a half. I still mostly consumed. My phaedo cardi B also isn't made it into those 10 people because I love cardi B. She's an amazing artist. I really loved her perspective in life and she teaches a lot about how to be resilient to haters. So anyway, I have still consumed. Feed but I'm also still can I'm also consuming on my main feed again and I just love social media. It's hard for me not to do it. And so I have to really like monitor my time and not get stuck in the black hole of it. But you know, I'm chatting. I like it anyway, so I hope any of this helps like I hope that any of my experience is resonating with you and that you are out there thriving yourself and out there figuring out where your next area for growth is. And you know I share this stuff because it's helpful for me to hear other people's experience and I frankly want to double dip. I will if I might find one I have to go through some shit and hurt and pain and resistance and all of that. I want the double dip of not only learning from it, but sharing it and like having this be for more than just like the pain I had to experience. I really want to help other people experience a glow up and have a great life. I'm really It's like when it comes to social media and stuff like as a quote-unquote influencer, I'm really not interested in followers. What I'm interested in is leaders people who are out there who want to lead you have to start by Leading yourself, right? Like so who want to lead in their lives, but then also like leave whether or not it's like in a formal capacity by taking on leadership roles or if it's just informally like in your life providing an example of someone who does Growth work grows in life is more kind trying. To do better things in the world, you know, like you just don't know who you have an influence on who you have an impact on in your life and I frankly don't think follower counts have anything to do with worthiness. I think in fact, sometimes they can mask a lot of things but I'm really out here just like looking for leaders people who like want me to help incubate their self-care, you know, that's a that's my ultimate goal for my patreon is like to have leaders who, you know want to have a movement practice with me. I think it's super meaningful. The shop for your body and for yourself at least once a week to like have some intentional movement practice and I always try to like download nuggets and I think it's really powerful to have, you know, lessons and bigger philosophies coming into movement class other than like having to get some aspirational body. Right? Like I'm here for aspirational like life and empowerment and fun and enjoy an impact. So anyway, that's my philosophy about that. I hope that wherever you are, you know that you are worthy of Love exactly as you are. You're amazing. You are an inspiration to many and you have no idea or maybe you do and I just like really appreciate you tuning in. I really appreciate you, you know being here wanting more for your life and and just like take a little time to dream like take a little time to think about like what's on your heart. What's your next big thing? And like why do you want to make an impact on the world? Just think about those things? I think so few people even spend time dreaming up what their life can be like and you're never going to get there. If you don't even think of it, you know what I mean? Like, I think like a lot of us just kind of like let life, you know sort of push us around and like end up places without really like consciously like considering like what can it look like or what what's possible for? Or me and like the more time every day that I spend just like in the possibilities that's available the more I'm able to connect into. Oh, that's so that's kind of a calling or that's something that's really speaking to me or oh, I love that idea for later. Maybe but maybe not. I'm not going to work on that right now, right? Whatever. Anyway spend some time dreaming. I've been signing off for forever. I'm going to cut this off, but I want to like play out with little John Mayer his most recent at-bat Carry Me Away. I I love an artist whose favorite like who's just constantly turning out something amazing and like it's his latest song is so far my favorite John Mayer song. So you're only as good as your last at-bat. I learned that from Gary V. And here's John Mayer's latest at bat. Love you all. I'm such a boy. I'm such a girl. Bummer there must be more behind the summer. I want someone to make some trouble been with you say inside my bubble take me out and keep me up on that. Carry me. Carry me. Scanning can I have some more? I can't understand it you fast car you foolish spender, you know you are and I Surrender come on and wake me up. That's kind of crazy.

Yes called Amazon you like if you owned a lot of fucking Limoges, you know, you got fucked. It was called Uber. Yeah, the music industry got confused because it looked like they got fucked with Napster and all that other shit, but it wasn't time yet. There's too many other ancillary things that they were able to control but it's starting to get real interesting. There's they realize that that's the yeah. They're so ugly.Look, they could read yours, you know stuff they go on to way to the 15 biggest NBA superstars realized they're getting fucked. Yeah. Oh, whoa now they don't want it now. Yeah I'm talking about could you imagine you woke up tomorrow? And you heard that LeBron Steph Durant and Giannis and Westbrook have left the league are now 50/50 partners with a billionaire and I've started the world basketball league and we have a draft of the month. I believe it's going to happen. Oh, yeah. It became too top-heavy. Yeah, I don't watch football for Patrick Mahomes and Tom Brady but basketball is 13 guys. Yeah, they're still not getting the Lion's Share of the profits any well, they're doing things literally literally the top 20 players could own 50% of a team tomorrow with a willing billionaire. Yeah. Basil's is one of them and it's airing on Amazon Prime. So wrap. Yeah, but they don't like the prom with the American Football League is they don't have stars. Right? Like if we like again if we all wake up and LeBrons like yo, I'm partners with sucks, you know, it's game over like, you know, if I don't think that's possible in baseball hockey or even football you care more about too many variables bath. It's just it's just it's just too many variables but 20 basketball players. Have 80% of the leverage. Yeah and do it, right it was good. It's your boy Juicy J. I hope you're enjoying the podcast with my sit down with Gary Instagram. Huh? Everyone's freaking out. I loved it. I'm laughing so hard from down all day. Yeah the down all day and everybody's it's been really nice for me because I've been yelling at everybody to diversify their platforms. So you got people 1.7 million followers on Instagram and 307 on Twitter and everyone's on Twitter right now. They sure are how you been I've been great man has been blessed me. You had a baby this year congrats my mom maybe last year, but she just turned one this year congrats. Yeah. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Yeah, so I just that's my first one. That's my just doing my daddy duties and stuff like that. So I'm glad we finally make able to make this happen. Hmm. He was talking. I mean he is so much going on all over the place. We were talking about everything like that because you think about it from a label perspective or collaboration perspective or business perspective. Yeah, we can definitely do some like that. You know, if you're interested like is so many that's what I want to do something artists. They don't they want to have like a lot of labels try to turn the artist into what they want. They see God is could be but I'm like more like, you know ours development left. Just be themselves, you know, you know, maybe getting some ownership if possible, you know stuff like that. Just try to make you know, because I feel like the artist makes the label so you need to treat this though. I think the label should start treating artist, you know, we're living more respect like going to they're going to be forced to because unlike the world I grew up in the labels will continuously lose leverage because things like SoundCloud and YouTube and Spotify didn't exist. The internet's the middleman. Yeah until people realize that they're going to be bone. Durable, so this is the greatest era to be an artist and it's going to get better and better and better. Yeah, because you can own the audience, right? I mean, yeah good evening yourself. I mean when I think about actually I think no internet. I couldn't even imagine what hip-hop would look like no internet the evolutions and all the nuances to the space. It allowed artist to be artists some of these cats that came up SoundCloud would have never been able to do this shit. They did no labeled of let them do any of that shit. Putting on some of that SoundCloud shit on fucking MTV exactly right away you grew up in the music business on. Yeah, so, you know about, you know, the distribution you still have all the leverage right? And now every day that goes by it has less Mmm Yeah Yeah, I was doing my stuff myself. And you know, I was fortunate to have a when I get with Sony records. They have like a subsidiary like relativity. It's yeah the ground black but they was let they let us do our own thing. They was like not even trying to change y'all do what y'all want to do. Y'all music is be the way I want to do it. I promoted how y'all want to promote it seemed like that. We've seen like like 200,000 copies Gold Records on Independent. You know, I'm saying making like that CDs who's making like $14 a CD, you know saying and you know, even the Mad phone 500,000 copies in time soundscan 14, that's a lot of money. So they knew who they saw us doing that so there's like, maybe I'll just keep doing what you're doing and we ain't gonna try to make y'all go pee. But Ernie onto crossover artist y'all on the ground stake on the ground. And then we just kept going out doing doing I think doing that thing and it got bigger and bigger and bigger. So I'd never try to take control at all. They will say y'all make the never give us the money. I make the music smart. We produced all the music. We wrote all the songs smart, you know, if we promoted it ourselves only thing they did was just put it out and sounds like my book deals. I said lots and lots of books don't worry Collins makes lots lots of money and they don't bother me at all. Yeah, that's right. That's like when you're in distribution, that's the get out of the way of the people. That know yep. Yep. That's it. Unfortunately like that's hard to do. You got to find the right ones and that whole game now the platforms are out of the way. They're not human beings. There's no Sandy Spotify. Yeah. YouTube is not a human. Yeah. You're right. What's so bits so game-changing. It's why it's so fun. It's why there's so much good art. It's why it's so I was I was walking the other day in the mall. And then the Maltese Chris. I just called the airport the mall. I was called I was in the airport and I'm just looking at everybody and I'm like man. We are finally in a plate like everybody looked different. Mmm, right? Yeah, like I was just thinking back to like the way I grew up like hip-hop culture. Everybody wore timbo's everybody wore fucking yeah that timbo's g baggy jeans like yeah. That was exactly the same. Yeah. Now you're about to sound the same, but that musically that's that's technology. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. But I was looking I'm like just everyone's different. Yeah, they got this weird color hair, you know about it like dig it, you know ya love and just like everyone's doing a hundred different things. Yeah that Mos Def and like everything Place. Mmm. That's what the internet did. Yeah the internet open the doors people now want to see more of you know, like they like the music but they want to see what's you know, what like I like Instagram like what is he doing all day a hundred percent? Yeah. Well, he's hanging out with his mom and I was kids. Are you hanging out smoking dope whatever you want to see. What you want to do that we sit in traffic. It's because people want to watch other people if there's an accident we're looking. Your nose is fuck and if you got something like interesting like you got some weird color hair or some crazy gold teeth for some time in first because then everybody else does it then it's not different anymore. True true true. And then then what then what ends up happening is my favorite part who's a one-trick pony and who's not hmm. That's the new game. Like, I think everybody's gonna get their 15 minutes of fame. Yes, the amount of people that are going to get 15 minutes of fame. It exists. Everybody's got followers. Now think about life in followers. Mmm rikes like followers likes everybody's famous. True who first can pop from the field. But the real game is when you pop and then everybody else puts face tattoos on their face. Do you have a second move? Yeah. Can you be Madonna was Madonna? Yeah. That's why Lady Gaga's doing her thing if you have real talent. Yeah. I've been doing it for 30 years. It's crazy. Is that right? Yep 30 and I'm old as fuck. Yep started with Three 6 Mafia tonight, you know doing my solo thing still been rolling. 30 years won Academy Award or a little song for a movie. I Remember You know that was some crazy. Huh man blessing me has been its neighborhood must have liked that one. Oh, yeah, they went crazy. It may seem like a people still congratulate me today. I was at I just left I went to the Oscars this time. There was a Layman grave. I like man. It's like 10 years ago like man, you still shining with it though, man. I probably wear that shit around my neck. If I had one I secured everywhere. Is that the house? I scared everybody would be really bars. I got it. So I Free food with that night. I wanted a guy gave me a Christian Academy Award like in hand back in the day. That's like having 15 million Instagram followers. That is real Flex that's still flexes. They were talking about the Monday to Monday playlist. They're kind of a little key. We're talking about sighs Sosa like this is gonna be so big exactly in like their like on the same way that you know, I mean some up so you see what you think about it Jerry think about it from a standpoint of like being smart about collaborations that really like completely penetrate you into the state of the moment or action like signing these kids like how you think about it personally? Well, I got to do a lot of flexibility. You can go about in a minute bunch of different ways. Yeah. I gotta do on a table right now with Colombia and we haven't signed it yet. And I love Columbia. I've been with them like pretty much all my life. Yes. It was since I was 23 I sounded deal when I was like 23, so I've been on the Columbia. It's the whole song even family, but you know, I got a deal on the table right now. Want me to maybe do to me president over there so still negotiating, but I know my way of options, you know, I'm saying like my thing is like let's I want to do something different like stir the music game of guitars development, you know pay attention to the Arts a little bit more, you know, maybe it'll give him a little bit ownership stuff like that and and ideas and you know, just kind of embrace the artists because the artist is the what makes the company have you thought about other businesses. Like how do you guys think about leveraging the brand and leverage and the iconic nature and like whether it's fashion or events? It's or alcohol or bubblegum weed. Yeah cannabis system. I'm very aware. You guys are doing with us. Yeah. Yes. Yeah. Yes. I'm super happy about that. That's gonna work. Yeah. I've been yeah, I've been keeping a close eye on it. Yeah. I'm a big I'm a big we'd head. So, you know that weed is definitely I mean, that's it. That's that's a given, you know, we can do that all day, you know saying please break it down for me. The screw you're filming your creative device love it use your system. It's awesome lot on managing for a long time. Thank you. I appreciate it. I'm trying my guy. I'm trying. When we sort of business was a rock and roll up first rock wrong have somebody talk to me man. She was sober big talk to me. So 74 you got into it just for my own. This is where I mean, I think history tells the My biggest hot take on the whole SoundCloud little pump. All that shit is that it's rap at the maturity that rock and roll was when punk rock started Mmm Yeah. It's like right like I hear Jesus say never fight establishment. Like fuck you Jake. Oh, like what? That's what they fucking did the Rolling Stones like, you know since shit mmm same shit. So since you were in the game right around right you start in 74 she got white hot with Unk in New York like 78 79 night, right? Okay. Yep. And what was what was your what was everyone's take on it? It was here the kids were liking it because we're loving it and The Clash all that shit right here. There were scared scared of station wagon, they were afraid and all of a sudden. And mainstream like everything else like rap at the time of course was underground. And of course. Mmm rap has rap hip hop has become worldwide cultural. Yes. It's got a has gone Way Beyond because of the social because of the ability to reach the planet in five seconds. You put up one of your post is a reading about it in Belarus hundred percent. So it's maybe not Belarus because that fuckers a dictator and doesn't let them know. The internet but for sure that's you know, I think that's where we're such interesting timing because the music landscape changed so much because of MTV like it's crazy. I actually think the most I do a lot of history unlike culture. I actually think like social networks. Most remind me of what I'm TV to like mte change the landscape people didn't want to make videos for MTV the original bands. Because they thought it was free music. Yes. It's like make it like mixtapes, right? Yeah, like like I remember when you came we really started looking and I remember being so fast and all that mixtape stuff we were doing and I remember just being fascinated as a businessman. I'm like are these artists and labels smart enough to understand how important mix tapes were and at the time back in know eight seven five six. There was still like a rub right like a mixtape when you're signed. It's so much more accepted now. Yeah, because the macro like labels understand the promotional value, so I remember a long time ago. That's exactly right. Yeah. I remember when I started doing my mixtapes Columbia used to be days to call my phone stopped putting out free music. Stop putting out free music all of a sudden. I got a hit record Bands To Make It dance it blew up and then it was on a mixtape and then they call didn't even know that I would sign with them. They had got like new Staff feel like would you sign with us? Yeah, I'm dying with you. That's what happened just like that. I If and I was like y'all crazy as hell is my lighter same way. I think about content on social all my shits free. Yeah, and everybody else is trying to get you into a funnel to buy like a by some sort. Of course. Well, that's what YouTube has become just a commercial. It's just like on a supermarket now nothing is adventurous there because they shut it down because of Unilever somebody like that saying no no. No, you can't do it. Yep. He's experiencing a talk about it. We're seeing that YouTube is stopping their traction there also stop and also stop. I mean look what you like. Listen follow the money. It's when headlines come out that's a ads are running on point of a pedophile content and they don't have the tech to shut down pedophiles, but not something adventurous. They have to go one day of the make a decision and what they're doing now inevitably. Cuz I understand Google well enough is all they're trying to do is get their Tech good enough. They're thrilled for adventurous. They're scared fuckless when Unilever or McDonald's or Coca-Cola pull all ads until you prove to me that my ad won't show up on a pedophile. Tell me their horses in New York at the time when I was getting ready to do their cable. Their cable license and she came out and said hip hop is horrible. It's horrible for society blah blah blah that Forest Time Warner or memory that story so that's how Universal wind up getting because she put up such a thing one woman and whatever her crew was they put up such a thing in New York and The Time Warner license with a cable was much more important than I remember that I saw that in a doctor per board. That's one tip for got it. It was the same thing. We have ever done an artist at the end the rating on the package. I remember it's our new touring The Adventurous artist because I started getting frayed the record company. Yes, the problem of the not the problem. The amazing part of the world is internet. Yeah, show me, you know, just, you know, kind of going full circle to what we're talking about is you know, what what were hopefully going to be doing soon with the other situation. Want to fuck up music business really disrupt disrupt disrupt the music business and away. Are you able to in the framework of that with that? It'll help I'll help but I'm saying that within this when you say, you know, what can we do that kind of situation as the world is ready for it and you'll appreciate this. I think you everybody here knows it it already happened true. Like right now it's about now it's riding the wave right this second. Some kid in Toronto 16 years old literally just now recorded some shit on free software put it on Soundcloud and in 43 weeks. All of us are gonna be like yo, that's he's next. Yeah, right. Yeah. Yeah, they still waiting for their stats. If they don't have the Staffing biggest probably the biggest probably have is their big artists are just not as big as they used to be not because Katy Perry or Taylor Swift or Jay-Z Are not big they're huge. It's just everyone's amortized. There's a long tail every listen that Killy gets is a listen that Jay-Z doesn't they're not moving quick enough. They're not they don't have the economic rationale for it. They're not signing the suicide boys that had signing these younger artists that are coming to Juicy's door every day every week saying all the time out of that because of the you guys discussed. Ahjussi data try to know how his own hands. So the goat that he is calling to go he was what happens when you been in the fucking game for 30 years. That is Major old as fuck is what he does. So he's like look, I've noticed that there's no artist development anymore really and things of this nature. You know, what tech that his nickname Tech create a CRM of some kind of funnel so I can you say hey you got music you got this on my Instagram go to Juicy. What is it Juicy J Talent search at gmail.com and two days 12,000 emails came under percent Non-Stop and they listening 90% of shit. But only 8 percent shit. Well words, I guess what one to say one. That's all you need. Who is that? I found Justin Bieber on YouTube. There was a lot of shit on their search it thats that's it. So what's happening is that he and there's a less artist. I'm gonna put him on blast but that come to him like in our studio sessions and I'll just pull up like juicy and you know, what's going on beat why they need a sound I need this what's hot because he's in this. Listen, you're either close to the street or you're not yeah. It's not super complicated to Binary game. Yeah. Yeah right would help him out with a deals to maybe like man you how much Publishers I'll be getting off this summer. That's right. You know, it's funny. I I say a lot and I was hearing obviously you've heard like I always say it's either information or It's Entertainment. Mmm. And if you can do both and you can be a goat, so we're at this point where it's like, okay, how do we get these artists on board and nurture him and you know gloma put them in certain areas where they can blow up. This is, you know, this is inevitable like Steve Stoute with his mom. All the platforms are doing it naturally themselves. The kids are so into entrepreneurship. They're like fuck it. I'll just do it myself like the internet what like I laugh. I'm like Ubers not bamas, like bookstores got fucked. It's called Amazon you like if you owned a lot of fucking Limoges, you know, you got fucked. It was called Uber. Yeah, the music industry got confused because it looked like they got fucked with Napster and all that other shit, but it wasn't time yet. There's too many other ancillary things that they were able to control but it's starting to get real interesting the herbs. They realize that that's it. Yeah NBA superstars realized they're getting fucked. Yeah. Well, they don't want it now. Yeah I'm talking about. Could you imagine you woke up tomorrow? And you heard that LeBron Steph Durant and Be honest and Westbrook have left the league are now 50/50 partners with a billionaire and I'm started the world basketball league and we have a draft of the month. I believe it's going to happen. Oh, yeah, we watch it became too top-heavy. Yeah. I don't watch football for Patrick Mahomes and Tom Brady but basketball is 13 guys. Yeah. Hmm. They're still not getting the Lion's Share of the profits any well, they're doing things literally literally. Only the top 20 players could own 50% of a team tomorrow with a willing billionaire. Yeah. Basil's is one of them and it's airing on Amazon Prime. So wrap. Yeah, but they don't like the problem with the American Football League is they don't have stars. Right? Like if we like again if we all wake up and LeBrons like yo, I'm partners with sucks. You know, it's game over like yeah, you know if and I don't think that's possible in baseball hockey or even football you care more about too many variables bath. It's just it just to it's just too many variables but 20 basketball players. Have 80% of the leverage. Yeah, you do it right. I'm shocked you out did that oversees already like the overseas? Well, there was a little bit of like you see a little bit of it with like the soccer players that are very similar spot. There's 20 of them that run shit. That's just a global 365 days a year. It's so fragmented to begin with between their tournaments and leagues and the you know, I don't know the NBA players are getting smarter and smarter by the second. They don't shorter contracts. I noticed a lot of NBA players the amount of shorter contracts because they have what But what really gets interesting is TV deals. So we have a sports agency my brother and I am were paying attention more to when the collective bargaining agreement comes up and they'll strike or not strike or they'll be a lockout and not but at the end result when the TV contracts come up its what happened the NBA when the TB money massively increased that's why we all freaked out when average players were getting big-ass numbers for like six men. Uh-huh, and that's because that's because there's only Can 15 guys you got it? I don't got to pay 12 15 guys and all that money. It's got to go somewhere. Yeah. Yeah. NBA players got paid. Yeah. They did. They deserve it man. We watch that shit all day every day. Yeah, I'm going to sell hoodies on Shopify. Yeah, that's what happened to me. I was just living my life. I got caught up in like the macro. It's not like I masterminded entrepreneurship got big. I just happen to be there. Honestly, right just like athletes these you got six men in the NBA who are going More money this year than dr. Jay made in his career timing. I'm just running businesses. I wasn't thinking about like cool people are going to fucking think. I was cool. Get the fuck out of here, right? It's just timing Yep. This is the same things. They got trapped in these 360 deals a hundred percent artists a hundred percent, but look artist took the fucking check. Yeah that 360 deal sound exciting wait for TV and stage and Live Events and maybe I won't And even do that many and I'll fucking cash it. I'll fucking bullshit that appearance. I'm supposed to be here three years. I'm not working. I showed up for 40 minutes. I'm a rap get the fuck out of here. Like right listen. Don't take the chat. Well, that's the reason why these longevity a hundred percent of is that a hundred percent discount plus honestly my favorite part Talent. Yeah Talent from he's my favorite like it's really it's not easy to write the first great book to write to have the first great album, but you just live your Whole life if you're especially if you write for that first album, it's your life and write it. You have your whole life and you write it and it pops because it's true. It's you and if you're a good writer if you have if you're a good writer, if you can really story tell you can paint a picture. It's your unique pick when Eminem starts talking about being white trash for the mom like that that resonate with a whole genre of nobody will ever talk like that. The problem is what do you do next? It's funny. I remember the Jay-Z like song Ray talks about like fucking against like really expensive paintings. Yeah, and I remember thinking how smart that was because I remember thinking how like just like that's what he should be doing. No, it's not going to rent like most people don't fuck the hottest girl in the world Hannah 80 million dollar fucking painting. Yeah, but it's better to tell your truth. Otherwise not cut saying anything. Yeah, that's where he's at. Yeah. Yeah people by her. They love the girl with you know, I'm saying because nobody will stay the same. It's always relevant always matters. So one of the biggest reasons Jay-Z doesn't have as much of a youthful audience is that Delta is enormous, you're 15 in the hood. You can't even be thinking about 80 million dollar paintings. So you're going to fuck with baby, you know? Yeah exactly. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, but for the people that are 43 and 44, maybe em, you're not in the millions, but maybe when you started listening to who've you were fucking work at McDonald's maybe now you make you know, even if you're making 40 or a hundred k at least you're grown up. Yeah, we should know what a painting is. Yeah, and that's been so I've been thinking a lot about just speaking your truth. Like when I think about why does my content work? I only talk about what's actually happening. You know, this is my fucking tea Grizzly, right? This is why I betting long Auntie Grizzly. That was it. Like he's like, you said something like we're in studio and he said something degree of like, you know, I just only write about what I actually lived. I remember looking at me like if you do that in perpetuity, you got something the story is real from call. Yeah, he's got his he and George. Yeah, he's got his real story. But again, everybody's got that struggle then they get paid their identity was the struggle in the hood, but now they're living in the suburbs of Bergen County. And they're scared to go there and I'm telling like go there talk about the feeling that you felt when you bought your mama house. Tell that whole story. Tell the whole story. Mmm. The truth is where I guess the punchline of my little rant here. Well, those funny juicy tells us all the time. He was like, you know, you got in La he had to get out. Yeah. Yeah when I was when I came here, I was you know after he won an Academy Award bought a house here. I'll just follow, you know ball and coordinated. How old were you I was like 30 and 31. I was you were finished, you know a living that's going crazy. Then all of a sudden I just felt like, you know the show start going down a little bit, you know. Phone ringing that's much and my brother was asking me my brother will come out here from Memphis you like what y'all doing man? What y'all doing? Y'all bull has fallen off a I got to get in the studio and make some more music and I was like man you right man, so I sold my house and just and I always had a house in Memphis. I just went back to Memphis and started just doing the same things. I was doing back when I was starts grinding like the can't believe you just said that you and I see why you're shaking head Caleb. I've been saying for the last six months a lot randomly and shit like this. I don't understand how people understand that the thing that you fucking did to get you. There is the thing that gets you to the next level, but people think once you get to a level now, you got to change it. Yeah, I think that's when you got a double down on it, especially in hip-hop music. They own the streets are the only thing that that's the currency that will do the same street corners are hung up with the same people may want to the hood shot videos and just soak up all that energy and I was like man, this is what I've been especially you put it through the filter of new shit you saw in ela you mix it a little you take People go a hundred from the street then they go to La and it's a hundred and I think the game for me is a hundred on the street. Now you go to La and you live it your the different life when you go back to the street, you take 80 of that mmm, but you mix it with 20 of the new shit then that's what I did. I came back to LA and I was like, man whenever I felt like I lost someone that was going back to Memphis and I said, I'm going to go back to LA and I feel like I'm losing them when I touch down in the back in the city and Los Angeles, I would never listen to the radio. I feel like the red so really missing my head up because I like the music is different, you know, maybe it's really just the visual. I just had was like eat caviar with a 40, you know what I mean? Right mix of course. You ready for this is a single reason. I'm winning on social. I still post every post. I write every comment. I'm in the trenches. I'm in my craft. That's me. Yeah. Yeah the big man. That's why doubling down on LinkedIn. And like that's the corniest like that doesn't seem right. But when you're in the trenches, you know, it's right. You're not worried about that. Mmm. You know what I'm really fascinated by with you specifically and just like, you know, like like something just happened that really like works for me the Jonas Brothers. I think once you build a brand and your iconic, you're always in play Until the End. Yep, you just have to be contemporary. Yeah, just one number one film back. It's just there's so much pent-up actual fandom. What are you doing Tour on this? Probably, you know many people listening to the audio of this probably right now in three weeks as a podcast smiled when you said Three 6 Mafia because you smile to a place you like I did it you like I would literally thought about moose and I thought about like dumb shit we were doing you know, like It takes you to a place. Do you owe me 40 year old women that heard the Jonas Brothers rebooted lost their damn Minds? Yes, because they thought back to her twenty thirty five thirty, you know, like those songs came back. They was at those concerts. Like wow, I remember that. I'm gonna that's what any consequence it's what Vegas does now based on that DNA once you get to that icon place like, Are and Celine Dion and hurt us? Yeah always have always have bands but if you could but where I think it's real interesting is you always have fans but like to me it was the Tony Bennett Lady Gaga thing. Okay, it's because it's what it's what it's why I like want you to do a song with keyed. Like there's such an equal trade. I think an established icon rapper and a up-and-coming SoundCloud rapper. The trade is similar to like and you know, I always think about them as like the little bit older guy with the younger lady. There's a train going on there. You understand. Yeah. Both parties are winning. Yes different agendas. Yeah, you understand. Yeah, like, you know getting schooled on the game having a mentor. Yeah. Look when that song comes out and all those 14 year olds, like who's that? Because they don't know. Yeah people take it for granted, but they don't mmm, I'm very hot on high low, and then I'm into genre mix I was telling nip so I didn't see the other day. I was like motherfucker listen to Kpop listen to country and he's like but it's not authentic. I'm like no no listened. And if you hear something that you're like yo, that was fresh. Then you do a little Googling. Let me call them and be like yo, bro in South the South Korea what you about how you grew up with a struggle. Are you my guy if you're in La come through and then all of a sudden and then it becomes authentic and then you come out with a Nipsey Hussle K-Pop song and next thing, you know you're in for Asia making four million - oh, yeah, that's that's I mean, I wish I had musical skills. I'd be the number one artist in the world my but I genuinely believe it. Look what I'm doing reversing. Your Instagram is the culture that I don't know cause I did it. I just did a country song with artists make the beat and everything. Well, I'd actually co-produced it because you're not in it. Yeah, I want you to be in it as a as a Lyricist. I want you to be on a song with fucking Blake Shelton. I like breaking culture like that. Yeah, that would work. That's how you win. I'm telling you right now. Go look at the math the way I look at it Kendrick Lamar and Taylor Swift song what that did for Kendrick people don't understand at scale and leverage. It was a dope idea and when you're a great artist you can get away with it all day long. People are scared like, oh, I don't want to sell other something. You're not thinking hey when I did it something I did this song like, you know, I got a song with Katy Perry when I did that song it was right today. I still perform this on they go crazy crazy. Yeah crazy. Yes, I would steal ya crazy. That's exactly what I'm talking about. Yeah, he was he was early with young nudie like before knew. He was really popping at all. He was on duties mixtape, like my biggest thing is I just want to bring value and then my main goal in life is to bring more value to every relationship. Ship that they bring to me and then never have to call in that variable. I like knowing it exists. I really love what people that I bring value to say behind my back and then my hope is that I don't fuck up enough for nothing tragic happens where I'd actually need those chips. I'm trying to put chips. I know they're there and by the way the best part I know that I put in ships and this is already have in my life. I put in chips I go to take a couple out and they don't have them for me. For some reason. It doesn't fuck with me. When you give without expectation truly not you're smart and you're giving and in four years. You're like, okay when he's a superstar, you know when you actually just give because you just thinking the macro somebody's watching. Then you can really live happy. That's why I'm so happy. Like I know I have the leverage and I know if the person doesn't pay back on what I did, right it doesn't you know, what's even funny it isn't even like fuck them. It's just like it. You said it right? That's why that's why jump that it's like maybe some shits fucked up with them at that moment. They fucked it like, you know, like I just generally believed that people have to worry about them slick. I like humans default into that. I'm okay with that. I'm empathetic. So I named them empathy wines. Yes, I have. Thanks guys for listening. Please. Please.

I laid in bed for a moment as I remembered. I was not at home, but in a bed-and-breakfast suite called the William Winter room at the Myrtle's plantation, the staff had shown me nothing short of southern hospitality yet in that moment. I felt like an unwelcome visitor. A strange sensation came over me. I sat up in bed and surveyed the darkroom a gust of wind swept through the open window. It was freezing even though it was a humid summer night in Louisiana. I walked to the window before I shut it I peered outside the live oak trees rustled and the moon cast a majestic glow on the It was the picture of tranquility and I felt at ease again. Then I heard a shot. I froze it pierced the night and rang in my ears. There was no screaming. no voices No sound but someone was hurt downstairs, and they needed help. I was sure of it. I slowly opened my bedroom door and crept down the hallway help me help me a man said my blood turn cold as I debated whether I should go downstairs, please help me anyone he pleaded. I descended the stairs my adrenaline through the roof. I surveyed the entrance hall. There was no one in sight. No blood. No wounded man. No one I stood there with sweat dripping down my face and my heart pounding out of my chest. Then I noticed the Moonlight pick up something on the floor. Muddy Footprints trailed from the door up the staircase where they stopped Midway. I followed the footsteps until my eyes fell upon a wall mirror in it. I saw a man lying on the stairs with a gunshot wound in his chest. He was barely alive trying desperately to climb the staircase my head swung around. No one was there. And yet the footsteps kept ringing on the empty stairs as though prepared to do so. for eternity Welcome to haunted places. I'm Greg Polson every Thursday.

People have traveled from all over the country to st. Francisville Louisiana to visit the Myrtle's plantation. The Antebellum era Plantation is replete with a rich albeit complicated history that dates back to the late 18th century. It's now a bed-and-breakfast that attracts visitors in search of ghosts of the Antebellum South General David Bradford who had a role in the Pennsylvania Whiskey Rebellion built the plantation in 1796 and named it Laurel Grove. He constructed a beautiful mansion on the six hundred and fifty acre plot complete with six Dormers and three Bays the interior boasted Sleek marble floors and arched Mantle's of the Rococo Revival a style that a pip. Mised European Grandeur and luxury. After Bradford died in 1808 his wife ran the property until she sold it to their son-in-law George Clark Woodruff judge. Woodruff was not a good man. Though I knew it troubled her. I still chastise Chloe for her behavior. She was putting us all at risk what would happen if the judges sweet wife Sarah found out I will always remember the way she looked at me the Steely resolve her tents eyes flashing between anger and pain. What choice do I have? I listened outside their door as I cleaned. I heard pain. I touched her I cursed her for putting us at risk, but she was right. What choice did she have after all it was better than being in the fields in that sweating Delirious son day after day with aching bones and a noxious mind then one day the master called. I entered his Chambers and there sat Chloe her face frazzled her clothes torn, but crude cloth gag shoved in her mouth, but her eyes. Her dark eyes ra Steely and fixed anger and pain. The judge looked calm in a furious and focused way. He was shirtless suspenders hanging down to his knees his hairy chest protruded triumphantly the large knife in his hand danced across the Whetstone with the practiced patience. Your friend he was saying to me has let me down. She's decided that the special treatment I give her is worth crying over his voice was low and rumbling. He looked at me with a cold gaze. You don't want to let me down. Do you? I shook my head with short and terse movements good. He made me hold the rag under her ear. Not a drop of blood is to touch the floor of my Chambers. He commanded. The knife went in with a surprising ease. I dared not look and Chloe sighs. I filled one ride with blood then another then I held the folds of my white dress against the terrible hole where her ear used to be I held it there as she screamed, but I did not spill a drop after all. What choice did I have? Chloe now wore a green turban to cover her wound. No one asked her about it. No one asked us anything anymore not even about the blood stains on my dress. She still took care of the children, but now her Smiles with them were fake and distant. What I saw her make the cake. I knew something was amiss I could have stopped her. I could have spilled the bowl or told the judge, but I did not. She met my gaze as the waiting to see what I would do challenging me to challenge her I swallowed and looked away. I watched her serve the cake to the judges wife Sarah and her two daughters. Nothing about Chloe smile then was fake. Sarah and the children died quickly, they suffered little to Chloe. They were innocent. It was the living that must suffer. The judge became enraged and unpredictable. I brought him whiskey after whiskey and watched him destroy his property piece by piece. He made me sit and drink with him. My head felt light he played with the blood stain on my dress running it between his fingers until he fell asleep in his chair. Then I heard the whispers. They seem to dance through the hallway the sound of pain. I dashed through the hallway, but the Whispers seemed only to grow louder. You must find us. They said you must you must what choice do you have? Then there was the mirror between its luxurious gold trim. The glass was foggy in a translucent way. I had cleaned it that day. I cleaned it every day. How could it be fogged up again? I could hardly see myself. My flat dark eyes were sucked in by the fog children. I was spurred. A small hand struck the glass from inside the arm disappeared somewhere behind the fog. I did not jump or look away as the greasy desperate fingers streaked down the mirror after I still cleaned the mirror everyday, but I left the streak of small fingers there. The judge was too drunk to notice the crime, but they were an important reminder to me. The which had cursed them curse the poor innocent children. She must be punished. I told the other slaves I told them what Chloe had done. I told them that they would be blamed and we would all be punished they listened and nodded and grew angry the mob gathered Chloe from her quarters in the night. She did not fight them even when they strung the Noose around her neck. She did not fight. They held her Loft for just a moment rope slung over the tree her eyes met mine. There was no more pain no more anger only judgment. What choice did I have I shouted crazed and Afraid. What choice do we have? They all looked at me? Then they dropped her. After Chloe died. They tied rocks to her body and threw her in the river. I walked out to its Bank every day, but her green turban never washed ashore. Legend has it that a slave girl named Chloe sought revenge on judge Clark Woodruff after he ended an intimate relationship with her he cut off her ear. So she murdered mrs. Woodruff and the children by poisoning their food. Some believe Khloe wanted to kill them While others hold that she only intended to make the family sick, so she could nurse them back to health in order to gain Clark woodruff's approval again. The Story Goes that Chloe met her fate at the hands of the other slaves who were afraid Woodruff would also punish them for her deed There's no evidence to support any of these theories or that Chloe even existed at all historical records indicate that woodruff's wife and children died from disease not poisoning. There's also no evidence to support that the woodruff's even owned a slave named Khloe yet people report seeing a ghost named Chloe haunting the plantation. Chloe's story gained notoriety when the owner of the house took a chilling photo in 1992 standing in the Breezeway between the general store and the butler's pantry is the shadowy nearly translucent figure of a young girl. Feel free to search for the photo. It will surely make your skin crawl. We'll return to our story in just a moment from the podcast Network and now back to the story. After the death of his family Clark would reflect the plantation slowly degrade until 1834 when he sold the house to roughen gray Sterling and his wife Mary Catherine Cobb, since they were leaders in the community. They wanted to have a home reflecting their prominent social status the property underwent an extensive renovation. fine furnishings were imported from Europe and the walls of the house were removed and we positioned to create for large rooms a formal dining room and a game room the renovation doubled the size of the original Bradford House and the Sterling's changed the name of the property to the myrtles after the crape myrtles That Grew on the crowns in spite of the Grandeur that the plantation exuded the Rich's couldn't spare them tragedy Ruffin Sterling died from tuberculosis shortly after the completed renovation. And only four of the nine Sterling children made it to adulthood as many times death has struck the myrtles. It's not surprising that there have been accounts of strange phenomena in and around the property including the ghost of William Winter. Winter was teaching a Sunday school lesson and the gentleman's parlor the house when a stranger approached the front of the property on Horseback and called out for him winter told his students to stay put and cautiously walked out onto the porch an unidentified man instantly shot him then charged off on his horse Winters stumbled inside the house and died trying to climb the stairs. To this day visitors claim to hear Phantom footsteps on the staircase. The history of the Myrtle's plantation was steeped in violence during the Civil War in the early 1860s. It fell prey to Union Soldiers the great deal of money and time the Sterling's invested into renovating. The plantation was for naught as the war wreaked havoc on the property. Many of their most expensive belongings were looted and destroyed by Union Soldiers post-war their wealth now largely in Confederate Currency was deemed worthless Mary Cobb Sterling had invested in a sugar Plantation, but it was destroyed in the war. With the property in shambles, it began to collect debt the Sterling Family eventually had to sell the land in 1886. The myrtles changed hands until it landed with Harrison Milton William in 1889 in the early 20th century his heirs split up and sold the land surrounding the house marking the end of the land's Plantation years. Through the 1970s the house underwent several ownership changes over those years both the owners and visitors have reported strange occurrences around the house when James and Frances Kermie Myers bought the property they decided to renovate. There'd been a lot of Buzz about the Myrtle's plantation is grand reopening as a bed and breakfast in the 1970s. Probably the person least excited for the reopening was the maid Julie hired for the task of cleaning the entire 22 room Mansion. Julie hated this place the way it breathed luxury. The whole thing was ornate in ostentatious and utterly retching. But she needed this job. She was desperate to get out of that cramped two-bedroom that uncomfortably housed her her mother at her mother's rat prick of a boyfriend. She smoked a joint to steal her nerves and got to work. Julie turned on her old antique Radio. She mopped to the rhythm of the music dragging her feet across the smooth marble floor with Carefree abandon. weird her radio rarely gave up like this She hit it a few times with the palm of her hand to no avail. Come on. She couldn't clean without music. Even if she was getting paid a cool 10 dollars an hour. That's odd James and Francis told her they wouldn't be back until late in the evening. She quickly Spritz the cleaning spray throughout the room to cover up the smell of marijuana. There was something off about the footsteps something distant and intimidating. She didn't dare call out. She dropped him off in Fright and it clattered to the floor the footsteps suddenly stopped. She stood stock still listening for any movement. She tiptoed over to the radio and turned it off. silence relieved Julie removed her shoes and started cleaning. They were back whoever it was was walking right toward the room. No, shout of greedy. No gesture friendliness. Julie wasted no time tiptoeing over to the closet. She shut the door and peered through its slatted louvers. The thin lines of light offered her a stunted and imperfect View. Julie saw too late that the mop and her shoes were left in the room. She held your breath hoping for a miracle hoping James and Frances returned early. She knew that if they didn't this could end very badly. a shiny black boot shot through the rooms doorway it hovered for a second as though unsure of its footing. Then it came down hard on the floor a second later the man entered. He wore a Navy colored wool uniform and forage cap. He had a long beard and held an Old Musket. So it leaned against his shoulder like he was in a military March but the most unsettling aspect of his appearance was the gaping Bullet Hole in the back of his head. The man entered the bedroom head tilted back. He sniffed the air his vacant eyes passed over the closet and Julie slunk away from her slanted view though. She could tell he didn't see her. He made his way through the room smelling her mom smelling the sheets of the bed smelling the radio. When he got to her shoes, he got on his hands and knees like a type of rabbit animal and took several quick punctuated inhales. His head snapped up with a start he stared directly at the closet directly at Julie. Heroes grabbed his musket and methodically crossed the room to the closet doors when he was in front of Julie's hiding spot. He slowly reached out his hand. Julie crashed through the closet door barreling toward the bedroom exit the man staggered back at his musket fell to the ground Julie burst through the bedroom door and took off down the hallway her socks struggled to maintain a grip against the marble floor as she reached the stairs. Her momentum was too great to maintain she tripped over one of the stairs and tumbled down hitting the landing of the stairs. Staircase hard in a daze. She could see the man approached her with his weapon still against his shoulder. She tried to stand but both her ankles were already swelling from the fall. The man descent it the Stars stare after methodical stare. Julie tried to slide away in her back, but it was no use her strength seemed to evaporate with her fall the man reached Julie and stood above her he stood there for what seemed like a long and arduous moment. Then the bullet wound in his head seemed to open first with just a trickle then it poured out of him puddling on the floor next to Julie. She screamed and shut her eyes tight no longer able to take him the gruesome scene. When she opened her eyes again. The man was gone. Later, when the owners and police arrived a thorough search of the premises resulted in nothing. No one was found. There was no sign of Foul Play. They attributed the blood on Julie's clothes to a wound. She must have received in her fall, but when she inspected her body that night she didn't have any cuts and scratches. Against her wishes Julie finish the job over the next few days since she desperately needed the money one afternoon as she was mopping She Came Upon a blood stain on the floor below the staircase in the shape of a human body. Julie attempted to mop the stain but no matter how hard she tried it remained taunting her warning her that she was never safe. Legend has it that three Union soldiers were murdered inside the Myrtle's plantation after they broke in and attempted to loot the house. They were shot to death and left behind bloodstains that refused to be claimed. Some say mops won't touch the blood stains even inanimate objects know that whatever Spirit lies in those stains insists on remaining forever. We'll return to our story in just a moment and now back to our story. Over the years many unexplained happenings have occurred at Myrtle's plantation in one of the Parlor rooms a grand piano repeats the same haunting cord until someone enters the room and it stops. There are accounts of unidentified sights and sounds of children around the house. Don't get me wrong. I was happy to get my students out here on a historic piece of land exploring and learning after all. This was a trip. I was trying to get the school to approve for years. We don't have the budget. It's not the right subject matter for kids to learn excuses. Finally. They agreed and the children's eagerness is Testament to my efforts my students and I enjoyed add a nice breakfast at the general store before beginning the tour of the myrtles. They were more interested in the ghost sightings. The plantation had been touted for but I assured them those were just old wives tales. Our guide commence the tour on the grounds. The land was vivaciously green and the large pond was idyllic. It was strange to see all this beauty amid, the plantations otherwise tumultuous history. We made our way over to the main house, which was bordered by a 125 foot long Veranda with ornamental ironwork detail the spacious front hall featured crown molding a French. Baccarat crystal chandelier and a grand staircase. There was no shortage of luxury ported to every detail of this house. The kids were definitely impressed. So was I the Regal interior appeared almost Frozen in Time as we pass the staircase? I thought I heard tiny footsteps above me. I looked upward curious. I did a quick headcount of my students. No one was missing but sir, the tour guide called out. I looked up everything. Okay. He asked I think I heard I stopped myself not wanting to sound silly in front of the children. It's just us and the good Lord present sir. The guide reassured me. I'm not it and they continued walking. I glanced up once more and saw the Hem of a girl's dress dark past the staircase railing above me one of my students Call My Name. Mr. Thompson. I shook off the unnerved feeling and rejoined the group. But as I walked away from the staircase, I could hear a little girl teasingly whisper my name. Mr. Thomson The hairs on the back of my neck stood up the voice was scratchy and unnatural and strange. At this point we made it to the game room which seemed to especially spark the interest of the children. I stood behind the group. Everyone's backs facing me except the guy who was addressing us. I noticed movement out of the corner of my eye slowly. I turned my head toward the glass door. The curly-haired little girl wearing an antebellum dress stood outside peering into the room. Her eyes her horrible eyes. They were pupil Alice and ivory white. She held a small and stubby finger to her lips. I obeyed horrified what the students might think if I shouted in Fright. She vanished beads of sweat rolled down my face the heat must have been getting to me. I tried to remember the last time I drank water and suddenly felt incredibly dehydrated. I hardly focused for the rest of the tour my mind burned with the image of the ivory girl. The sun was about to set when we finally reached the end of the tour the students took photos in front of the myrtles all the while. I kept glancing back at the house. I felt a shiver down my spine time to go kids. I said as I rushed the students onto the school bus, I noticed that Matthew was missing. He was an explorative child with a big imagination. It's no wonder he wandered off curious little Her I crept inside the tour guide was gone, but he had not placed any restrictions on re-entering the mansion. I heard of patter of soft footsteps down the hall and followed them. The empty interior was massive and chamber like every noise echoed missed your Toms in I stopped. straining to hear the soft voice Matthew I called through the cavern. He's this way. Mr. Thompson this way but you have to hurry. I didn't know which way the voice came from it seemed to be everywhere. I saw the mirror and stopped its world with a translucent gray fog in it. I could see the figure of a boy a boy that did not belong a boy desperate to get out. His face was covered with a mixture of mud and sweat and blood his eyes were shut tight and his mouth opened in a scream. But no sound came out. I was suddenly aware of the cold and thick silence around me. I approached the mirror and confirmed what I already knew. The boy was Matthew. His curiosity had taken him too far. I approached the bus confused and disoriented unaware of how to tell the parents that I lost their son knowing that they would never believe the truth. But when I got to the bus and look down the rows of seats, I noticed they were all full I called Matthews name. No one responded. The students looked at me quizzically. I searched through the roll call sheets tore them apart really examined each check mark next to each student that assured me. Everyone was on the bus. No one was missing. Matthew's name was not there. One of the famous paranormal features of the Myrtle's plantation is an ornate hallway mirror visitors claim to have seen handprints watermarks and even figures in old-fashioned clothing lurking inside the glass. The figures are said to be Sara Woodruff the wife of Clark Woodruff and their two children who allegedly died from poisoning at the hands of the famous slave girl, Chloe. One of these children is believed to be the ghost girl of the Myrtle's plantation. She's known to run about the house giggling and haunting unsuspecting children and adults.

The Myrtle's Plantation will be the site of the second-largest haunted house exhibit in the US when it opens to the public in October, the Times-Picayune reports. The exhibit, which will include a re-creation of the 19th-century home's parlor, will feature everything from a mannequin dressed as a 19th-century cook to a model of the home's famous staircase, which was once used to climb to the first floor of the main house. Paranormal investigator Greg Polson, who has been investigating the place for more than 20 years, tells the Times-Picayune that the main house, which was built in the late 18th century by General David Bradford, is haunted by a number of ghosts, including that of Bradford's wife, Chloe, who ran the plantation until she sold it to her son-in-law, George Clark Woodruff, in the late 1800s. She is believed to have been the target of one of the judge Woodruff's most gruesome crimes, when he stabbed her with a large knife",0.17424242424242428,0.15151515151515152

I am so pleased to be coming to you live again today, you know, two in one week, you know, it's something to be said when you're popular people want more podcasts and that's just what I'm trying to To give them so before we get to our next coaching profile interview that I'm super psyched about this guy. I'm going to go ahead and remind everybody out there that's looking forward to the the school year to start kids. If you're out there and you're listening just 13 days until you're right back in it right back at school have fun. You know, those are going to be formative times for you a blast. Just keep wait until then August. The Eighth Day and which you know, you get to fall asleep in class again, so without further Ado let me bring you my next coaching profile interview and now I am joined by a guy I went to school with back in 2011 has now Clara. Well, I can't speak has now climbed the ranks and is the head varsity boys soccer coach Johnny bar ditch coach bar ditch. Welcome to the program. Thanks Nate. Thanks for having me man. It's it's it's just really cool. I mean it you obviously get to a point in your life in which teachers in which you once had in high school or starting to make their exit and get toward retirement, but it makes way for new teachers and coaches and you know, that's one of the privileges in which you're entering as far as like a new wave of teachers and coaches that prep. So appreciate you joining me. Mhm. Mhm. So let's get started today with a little bit of ice breakers get us loose and also get people give people a chance to get to know coach Bart it here just like we've done and we did with mr. Ferraro the previous day. Give me height and weight coach. Let's see sitting at six foot 180. All right, we love that. You know, 6-foot guys. It's always like five 11 and 3/4 and now Round Up to 6, so it sounds good. I love a double your six-foot my book now. Back when you did play Johnny or should you know, I got to get rid of that your you are a coach. I need to treat you like one coach Bart itch when you were playing man. What was your soccer number? I was number seven. All right, give me the backstory why Cristiano Ronaldo? Who was it? No, it wasn't as actually a big Didier Drogba fan. He was number nine, but that's the central forward number. I was a Winger midfielder 7 was for me. Okay, I like it. I like it. My mother my brother wore number seven. So I like that. Now you have heard this question before but I want to give it to you because it's a tough one in my book burrito or pup muffin. Give it to me. That is a tough one. I think I have to go with burrito hands down burrito. Yeah. No, it was a very common one and people love to get the burrito get a little bit of the salsa now if you did work, so you did you get salsa. Did I did? Okay Saul sky where you guy that opened up the burrito put the salsa on the burrito or did you dip it in the sauce? Elsa it's a good question. I think I was a dip and go. Okay. Yeah, you know, it's people are on the go. You only got 15 minutes of break. You gotta you gotta you know, make up time somehow. So my next question is this and this is vital. I always knew you as a sack lunch guy back in the day. Give me your peanut butter to jelly ratio. I go heavy jelly light peanut butter. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. I know P. We got an issue here. We just got word from coach Bartow to hear that. He is more heavy on the sweet side than the salty side. That is a shock to me because if you're out there pup fans and you're on my side and I believe you are it's way more peanut butter than its July. I'm a 60/40 guy. It's 60/40 in my book. You need more peanut butter. It's protein. I would dare say 70/30 jelly. Love it. As you know seeping out the sides man that is a topic for another podcast, I guess because that would probably get way too heated and we got a way too many things to get to now, let's look at this halftime. All right during your soccer days. It's common you get some snacks, maybe okay and my days for football, it was orange slices. Mmm. So my question to you is orange slices or apple slices. Yeah. It's the orange got to go through orange orange slices and side too. Capri Sun. Okay. All right. It's the combo. That's fair because I feel like just the orange slices you come out of halftime and you just you put it in second gear man. You just ready to go. Love it. Alright now, let's get into back in your time at prep. To Dean's that we had. All right. I don't remember you being too much of a troublemaker. You stayed pretty clean, which is good and probably why you're ultimately a head coach now, but if you had to choose, okay between two Dean's we've got mrs. Tom McEwen. Mr. Walker. What was your decision man? That is a that's a tough one. I still deal with both today. I see him very often I coach mr. Walker's daughter. So I need to tread lightly. I you know, I'm gonna go I'm gonna go with Peggy Hamakua and she taught me a little bit, you know closer Affinity with her in this what I think I'm gonna go with. Okay. All right. No, that's fair. I think if you know, I didn't have the greatest relationship with mr. Walker, but probably if I had to make a choice of go see the Deans and I had to choose between the two I probably are on going to mr. Walker because miss Tom McEwen I could just see if nope. It's black and white Maybe you were wrong. And you know, here's your job. All right. Now last thing that I'm curious about we alluded to it in a previous podcast when I had Steven Angelo Ferraro shout-out on on the show. We talked about your Johnny hustle ability. So my question to you is if you were to race anyone of your current soccer players, do you think you could beat Any of the guys currently on your team in a race? I'd like to think so, but I'm really not sure. How long is the race? Well, let's go 40 and you're doing a for yeah, maybe a couple I'll go I could probably be 15 percent. You know what that means is Dave one come spring season when you guys start, you know, who's gonna be there me stopwatch. I'm marching out 40 yards and saying let's go right now because I know you guys have heard this and hey coach Bart. It's just challenging you and I think many will. Gladly accept that so you better start loosen up that hamstring right now man right now. All right, so enough with the fun and games, let's jump into the fact that incredible year last year your first year as a head coach. I didn't necessarily follow you guys as closely. It was the kind of thing from afar that coming back into Spokane people looting and saying you get a That soccer team last year and you know coach Bart is just got an I'm like wait, wait a couple things you bring up the soccer program next. You're saying coach Bart itch. It's like where have I been? So if you could for those out there listening take us through a little bit last year. Yeah, the it was just a wonderful season. I was with the boys. So I've coached JV for three years. This was gonna be my first Varsity season and luckily. I had a pretty good rapport with the boys, you know. Knew him really? Well and I knew how to push them and everything like that. So going into the season. I knew what we had. We had a couple surprises of you know, a freshman that comes in. There's always a freshman that surprises and then, you know a couple of kids here and there we were pretty young team and it took us a while to get going. We had a very hard spring season and especially a preseason as many know our spring this year was I don't even know. Cold wintry three feet of snow you name it are Spokane spring. Thank you a yes. Yes a great Spokane spring and we were shoveling our first day of the season. I think our first home game was maybe three or four weeks into the season because we had snow on the field. We couldn't move it, you know, there's feet and feet. So it was it was a tough spree season, but I think we played the motion the GSL we played our full six or seven. We went over to Seattle got you know, kind of got whooped when we played as a quan Redmond, you know to Great State team. But then we knew we could play with them at the same time. So we kind of came back from pre-season kind of looked our wounds got ready for the regular season and then we kind of went off and running. You know the spring season four boys soccer. You kind of have to break it up you have before spring break and then you have during spring break after spring break. So you want to make sure that you get I think it's three or four games before spring break. You want to at least get three points for a win one for in overtime shootout loss to for overtime shootout win. So it's all about points in the soccer game. You want to make sure you have at least six points, you know, you want to get a couple points going into spring season. We had a Again, first game of the season played CV just too pretty old Powerhouse to come to shootouts ended up losing but we got a very valuable point which really came in at the end played a couple more games got a couple more points. So we're going into the spring season spring, excuse me, spring break feeling pretty well. And then you kind of Hit the the dead of the Season where we ended up playing, you know, some tough for a school's back-to-back-to-back had a tough week where we lost to you. Hi Elsie. He and Ferris back-to-back-to-back, which wasn't great last season the regular season of the game. We play Mead at prep senior night, you know the see I have six seniors on the team where you know, everyone's excited. We're ready to go. We're finally playing some good ball. We have guys back and we just play lights out and up beating them to one and that was honestly me and my assistant we were kind of talking about this. That was what we felt was the start of our season. The last game of the regular season we made postseason one of our goals and then we just started running and then we think we rattled off six wins in a row 6 of 7 wins. You know, it took it took for our back to be against the wall. But once we were there, we really knew what we had and then we made a run to state which was awesome. Yeah. No, I think that was pretty cool. And one of the things that I had the privilege is I checked out your Facebook page and the pictures that were on there, you know, obviously as you get older there and you post less and less and so the first thing that was at the top of your page was some photos in which shoutouts middle picks mrs. Micawber had posted on there and it was super cool because it had basically your guys victory at Albion who was that dance in Central Valley that was for the district third place winner out. Excuse me loser out when it goes to State that's cool. And it was a wild game. They beat like I said earlier they beat us. Regular season we come out blazing we score three goals in the first half kind of unheard of up three nil at halftime CV and you knew they were going to come back, you know, great coach great players Dynamic players and they come back and score 3, you know one goal 10 minutes in another goal 10 minutes after that seven minutes left on the clock. They hit a header to tie it we go to we go to overtime first overtime session. And one of our players it's a great free-kick game-winner rips his jersey off and we all celebrate and it was almost under at their coach. Okay. A guy ripping his jersey off after a game-winning goal. Okay. I see the fact that it was a game-winner. But the Jersey rip off had he done that any any point he had not okay, but the passion you've got to love it. It's a classic soccer move know if I was seeing Zlatan Ibrahimovic shower in there and he's cristianos lot on they'll do it. So it was it was a cool scene though because if you have the opportunity The and you know, you're a friend of the program and also friend of Coach partage. You can see a shot by shot tracking of the goal being scored and then the celebration that ensued after that and one of the things that I wanted to point out that speaks to you as a coach and the respect those kids and loved those kids have for you is if you get to the end of those those shots where coach partage runs over there to join his team in the Celebration you see kids swarm to him to you know, a coach this is so awesome that kind of thing. You can only imagine as they're hugging and making them equally a part of that celebration that it's hey we're here and you know, you brought us here and that's why we know we're here and it's just that's the coolest thing and I can't imagine that you want anything more than that as I catch it was a great moment, you know in my young coaching career. Is my first Gatorade bath that was also very cool DMC 8. Calvin is just a great moment. But again, you know hats off to player the coach can only yell so much we can only gain plan so much. It's all up to the players to execute and especially in a game like soccer. I don't have a timeout. I don't have a I have a half time speech but that's our halftime preparation, but that's about it. So it's the kids need to be able to problem solve on the go and you have to be able to deal with the punches so, you know hats off to To our team is extremely resilient towards the back end and just dealing with you know, dealing with all sorts of pressures that the kids really succeeded and I think that makes me think of the cliche. That's sometimes my dad would look at me and go now Nate sometimes it's not about the x's in the O's it's about the Jimmy's in the Joe's so, you know, sometimes you just have to tip your hat to kids when they, you know, pull through and they make a game-winning goal and it's it really is a credit to those kids. The hard work they put in you know, nothing to coach doesn't do their job too, but it's you know kids got to meet you halfway. Exactly. So now looking forward and you being a seasoned coach, you've had one underneath your belt. All right old and crusty season KF. What I want to know is what plans are. What changes do you have after that first year into the second year now? Well for the you know, the coach I was at the beginning of the season of the coach. I was at the end is starkly different just from player management to understanding the GSL season 2, you know little just kind of plays here plays their little just wrinkles in your game that I think I have to build upon for the next season. I you know from the JV level to the first level, of course I was with RC teams being assistant and all that but it is very very different everyone, you know looking for you for all the answers and I enjoyed that and I really relish that opportunity and I love being a leader. I think me being so young help me relate to the kids really well and especially me being around the program, you know, it wasn't a big, you know, big change or anything like that all the boys really comfortable with me. So that really helped as well but looking towards the future. We lost 16 years. As you know solid solid players and we have a young crew coming through. So I'm really excited. Our sophomore class is a really really develop technical team. And you know, this is a great team to build on but at the same time did you sell stuff? They're always known I feel like we always send someone to the final four this year Ferris made it to the final four CV wanted a couple years ago. Just really tough tough team. So for the It's just you know, my preparation will be much different before I had no idea what I was getting into to be honest. Now. It's my player management my dealings with the school and our recovery, which is a big deal of it. All is, you know, well more endowed and I'll be able to hopefully, you know, take a step forward. Yeah, you know for myself and I think a lot of others out there that you know soccer still relatively new to them and something maybe they don't follow a ton, but I think that it's actually picking up steam. We've seen the success that the woman's USA soccer team has had hopefully the men can make the World Cup next go around. Hopefully what I want for our listeners though. And for even myself when you say something like technical, what do you mean by that for guys, you know Foot Skills being be able to work in small areas. So, you know direct play as you knocking run so you got athlete's up talk try to just blast in technical players are you know, you can work in small areas. Hate combination passes intricate runs everything like that. Just kind of working in. Yes, small areas great footwork Vision all of that. Okay? Yeah. No, I like that. That's good inside as I obviously get more into the swing of the technical conversation of soccer. So this is good really good for me informative educational you learn something on PSP. All right now expectations for the season. Right, you make it to the state tournament last year what's expectations this year? I think we have to keep it at the same or raise the bar. I'm never satisfied. You can't be complicit. You have to always push and strive farther and that's something I like to tell my boys, you know never settle always try to reach for goals because you know, you you have to have lofty goals you have to drive for those. So I think making State again this year. We played Federal Way went over to their place. Up losing 2-1, you know really really good game. Great team that the team we played their Centre mid one Seattle Times player of the year. So, you know, we went up against pretty formal team. I think he had like twenty four goals in 22 assists, which is just out of this world for a high school player. And you know Gonzaga Prep in Federal Way kind of have a bit of a rivalry in different sports. So it's a little tough losing to him, but the outlook for this season is and you know, the boys are used to my coaching style now, I have different tendencies. These and I have different tactics and now they have that under their belt. I think we'll be able to build upon that and be able to go, you know, a leg farther hopefully and ideally go leg farther. Yeah. No, I think without a doubt especially when you just talked about the fact that you've got young returning talent that they're going to be able to build off of a season last year where they got good postseason experience and that's something to be said because you you can't replicate that in practice to piggyback off that idea you keep Completely right big game experience especially in soccer is huge because like I said, you can't call a timeout. I can't you know 15 seconds left on the clock of a basketball game. I'm going to call timeout. We're going to run a certain play that we've ran 35 times in practice and we can get a bucket with Sakurai. You know, I can only yell for so far, you know 60 yards away from the play the ball. So what are you doing? Exactly exactly. So it's you know, they have to be able to like I said earlier, you know roll with the punches. They have to be problem solvers on the field. They have to communicate Anna Kate with each other and then they have to get the job done collectively. So having that, you know kind of with that in mind it's you know, that's that's all very important. Yeah, so to build upon that and everything that you just alluded to what are what are some things that you can give an example of that you've made the team your own what some things that you've come in and you know, I had the team adopt that's you know, coach partage I think preparation. Actually no preparation is key. So we would spend every training session. We would spend an hour to 15 minutes in the team room watching film going over certain tactics. I'd like to think that I got my team very prepared for the season and very prepared for every single game. We had a scouting report of every team which don't really know if they did that before but that's the you know, that's the time I spend that I put on it and you know knowing if they play a Highline, okay, we're going to try to get in behind. Knowing if they have to Dynamic forwards. Okay, we need to be pinched and tight and our back line be very compact not allow through balls yada yada yada, you know all that stuff. So being able to be prepared let the boys know what is going to occur what's going to happen. So then they're not surprised and all of a sudden, you know, this left-wingers just blazing down the side and just torturing us all game long and these, you know where that come from. Hopefully I give them an idea prior to that and then also, you know watching film we spoke of it. Briefly earlier kids are such for visual Learners these days. So I try to get them in front of film as much as possible trying to be able to watch themselves. Watch the team not only watch the ball. But you know Watch Team shape everything like that and then being able to build on that collectively moving the ball forward back possession everything like that. So that's really important. Yeah. I know. That's awesome. And then when you hear coach barter say when we had spoke before it's an honorary thing here the pup Sports podcast. You're a guest you are truly a guest of honor to come you get a barbecue you enjoy somebody some daddy sodas maybe and you have have a little pregame barbecue before the podcast and then we come down record and that's how things flow. So if you're under the thought process of oh man, what would it be like to be on that show? That's what it would be like to be on a show you you don't know what you're missing out on so gracious host. Yeah. Exactly. So you touched on some really good things and you actually had said, I don't know if they did that before when you were learning to film work and prep work before your to play a team. What are some of the things though that you adopted from the previous coach before you and who was the previous code before you so I've had great mentors in my life as a player at a great mentor Tim Seeley. He was my coach for multiple years and he really kind of showed me the way of how a player should play. And then in my coaching career Billy barmes, who's the girls varsity coach, he was the boys, but I've been under him for a few years and then the previous boys coach was burning Croft and he has a wealth of D1 experience in a great coach as well. And he was a mentor that really kind of brought me brought me under his wing and taught me just the ins and out of being The head of a teen, you know, you have 20 guys on your team. So it's you know, you have all these different personalities all these different egos, you know, bringing it all together. So he really did help me with that part getting team chemistry team morale everything and bringing that all together. So he was a great mentor and and taught me quite a bit. That's that's that's really good. And it's really important. You know, I think that when I look at even a personal experience to watch My brother here we go. That's that's that's your classic voice crack that you've been well accustomed to now my brother being a Coach and he's been a coach now for I feel it's been over 10 years. Now. He had the privilege of kind of the tutelage of my dad for coach for over 33 years and that's so important when you've got guys that are doing it the right way before you and you have the opportunity to just slowly evolve and take your Time to take piece by piece of what someone does really well it's so vital and then by the time you get to step into the head coaching role, it's people look at you like yeah, you are the head coach. They don't have that time period where they're like What's this gal about its know we've seen him around we've seen we've interacted with them. We know he's fully qualified and we know that he said great guys come before him and he's our expectation is equal to those that have come before us that's really great. And it's like any profession, you know, you take bits and pieces, you know, you see what they do. At this certain situation he say oh, you know, I don't really like that. So I'm not going to use that you see him acting this situation, you know, that's perfect. So I being able to do that has been great. Yeah. So what I want to shift things into now is looking at what it's like to be a head coach at a school and general so we know that and we've we make jokes all the time. Obviously we see the crowds that football guess we see the crowds that basketball gets and then you see some other sports and you You know, you know the three variants. Yeah the three moms and then in the crowd, but what I want to know is what is it like to work with other sports within a program or a place like prep? Yeah, first off, you know, I'm incredibly lucky to be able to be employed at prep and work at prep. It's a great Community the support systems great. They back you 100% and everything. I can't you know. I can't express how much I've had help from Gonzaga Prep and being able to work with me my schedule but also just you know support me throughout it, but it's it took me, you know, as it once again as a JV coach as able to kind of see how the varsity coach has interacted with parents interacted with coaches other coaches teachers the school everything like that and I was able to pick pieces here and there but you know, it's it's extremely easy. So track takes the field before us. You know, they're off at 4:45 if they're not, you know, we jump on and they just jump off and you know, it's it's very easy, you know, we rarely have issues and if do if we do, you know, we're always cool headed and able to work it out with each other. That's really good. And I know that one of the other challenges that you must face and you have faced for years as being a JV coach and ultimately be in a head guy when you're not on campus, I mean that presents some time. A potential conflict with a little bit of an issue. What I want to know is what's your experience been like working with Administration? And yeah being an out of building coach, you know, I don't get to see the kids during the day. I see it as a benefit but also I see it as a little bit of a hindrance because I can't see my everyday I can't you know check on them. You know, some of my kids I find out later, you know didn't come till third period and then they come to training is something I don't find out until you know later down the road but But being being in out of building coach has its perks as well. You know, I can kind of you know, I don't have to bring my employment to my coaching as well for me coaching is a hobby. It's an outlet. I love it. I have a passion for it. I feel like I have a knack for it and being able to you know, once I come to prep, okay, it's on you know, we're ready to coach or ready to prepare. We're ready to train recover whatever it may be but being able to do all that at the school has been great in the facilities are Not as well. Yeah. No, I being around that campus and walking down those hallways that's popping into offices and you see 65 inch plasma TVs on the wall, and you're like, yeah life stinks, right? So ya know there are some different things that you know prep is and the community has blessed. It's coaching staffs with and I think that that's awesome. I mean, I'll brag about that any day of the week because it's the community that gives Is that stuff back? It's not like prep teachers are going out and buying that stuff or you know, just being handed their it's the community that's saying, how can we help? Hmm? Yeah, it's we always have a huge support from the families, which is great. And then also, you know, I come up to the athletic director Paul man for and say hey we want to do two games in Seattle. He says, okay, let's make it happen or we want to go do a trip here or a trip there, you know, it's never an issue. It's more of how can we get this done kind of thing and that's the attitude. I love. Yeah. I know that that really is nice is it I start to have naysayers every time you come to them and it's like I'll try better now better luck next time. All right now so the other part and last piece of that we touched on how dealing with other coaching staff dealt with how dealing with Administration now the Big E and usually for new coaches is the of greatest challenge. What's it like dealing with parents? Yes my parents for my you you were great. I once again, I think be coaching that freshman group. My JV my first JV season really helped. I knew all the parents through all four years. We had a great relationship and I think just being honest. That's that's the the biggest key. I I'd like to think that I'm very upfront with all my players playing time. If they have an issue my office door is always open if they can come talk to me at any time and I also try to head those conversations off at the start. So there is no You know him either hawing like, you know, am I going to play this week? Am I not going to play this week? I'd like to think that in training first off you set yourself apart. And then secondly, you know, you should know you're standing within the team and any with the soccer team, you know, you have your starters you have your reserve players, you have your subs and everyone plays a part you have to have Squad players just like any other sport you have to have Squad players to bring up the level. So but anyways getting back to the parent issue. I mean my parents were wonderful. I never once had an issue. I you know knock on wood, but I hope to never have an issue but I you know, I've heard horror stories. I've talked to the other coaches in the building and You know, unfortunately, we're in a day and age where the parents do play a role and I would love for me just to you know, it my relationship was at the kid and me and the sports team and everything like that. I'm I have no problem having a relationship with the parents, but it really should just be between the coach and the the player and that's that's where it should be and but once again, you know, the parents have been wonderful to me and I don't have any any horror stories to tell about that's good and I think That when you look at how the kids responded when you had crucial victories throughout the year it and even I think in what I looked at one of those photos to it looked as if a dad it's knocked down to the field when your pillow players were celebrating and was right there with a camera to capture every moment of that sounds about right. So, you know that the support is there right now and one piece that I would always say to you parents are as loyal and in your corner. When you're winning right now, one of the things that you've had a luxury and I think it's a product of good coaching. You can't just say I was just blessed with the good team and I fell into it. No it was again. It's a it's a give and take thing. It's a Meet Me Halfway you had a successful team and that does a lot for parents players. And then also to you have less guys coming into your office and saying about playing time. Hmm and the way that you know, that it doesn't bother them maybe the They didn't play as much is that every single guys down there celebrating when you get a win and it's not the kind of thing of I'll mosey on down. It was every player in there, you know vests running over there to celebrate with the team and when it comes to parents perception is reality. So that's that's just a whole nother whole nother can of worms that we could dive into it another another date on another episode so last question for you, and and again, I appreciate you Joining the show and kind of having the ability for everyone to kind of get the Insight on you as a coach and then you know your your journey to get to where you are today that I think is spoken for a lot of the success that we've seen. But my last question for you is what what value does playing in this program at prep bring to soccer athletes at prep. So why why would a kid play soccer? ER at prep You know, I think you know prep is it's a great institution, you know, not only with the academics but the Athletics as well facilities are great. But you know, you're going to be able to you know, it's top-notch stuff and with my coaching. I'd like to think that I prepare you and I get you thinking about the game in a little bit of a different way. We always actually let me I'll ask you a question 8. All right. What is the fastest thing on the field? The ball your brain. Oh, wow. Exactly. Yeah, it's is what you get them at you get him on that every time well, you know biology chemistry and not my or physics was my strong suit, I guess but okay the brain. Yes. I see it. I follow I'm with you. Yeah, so that's something that I think that I like to challenge my kids, you know, I asked them questions all the time. I try to challenge the mentally because that's a lot of you know, plenty of guys are fast. They're strong. They're quick athletic yada yada yada, right? Not a lot of people are mentally fit or have the mental fortitude to be able to play 90 minutes or excuse me high school game 80 minutes, but be able to you know Shield off a tackle pick up your head find a pass all of that. So I'd like to think that at Gonzaga Prep we prepare you but we also challenge you intellectually we challenge you mentally and really get you ready for the rigors of a game. But then also try to get you ready for business life for a work life because There's plenty of times when you're in the office. You have to problem solve on your feet or you have to do, you know, a problem occurred and you have to jump out at it or you know, all these different things. So being able to think on your feet think quickly, but then also be challenged in an athletic way I think is really important super important and I've I think I've encountered that plenty of times in which I could Channel back to, you know, an athletic career in which you're on the field and a given moment. You got to make that split decision now we do have one. Question from a active listener that when I was speaking to him just earlier today. Justin Gates had a question for you former teammate of yes backup club and high school Justin wanted to know and wanted your input of what impact has the soccer program had from guys that solely play soccer only now so back in the day when he said that he He played he had he was like one of the only guys that played soccer and that was the only sport he played now, it seems do you guys have more Soul just soccer players I would say unfortunately. Yes, the way High School athletics are going it seems to me that you have to specialize by like eighth grade and that's a shame. I I fully believe that she could you play as many sports as possible. There's a bunch of studies out there that say, you know to sport three sport athletes are more resistant to Injuries and all these different things Kobe Bryant said that he had a lot of success in basketball because of soccer he grew up playing soccer in Italy and he learned how to work in threes and fours a lot of soccer players nowadays working one and two so, you know given goes like basketball, but you need to be able to see the bigger picture and work in threes and fours. So being able to do that is, you know, really really key and question out of it question from a listener. I like it. Yeah. No, I we love acting if the Sinners out there. And again, we want to open it up to any time. You have a question for a potential interview that we'll have with a coach because we're going to profile every coach at prep. Well, I shouldn't say every coach every varsity coach to cover my bases. If we get to more than that great. I'd love to get into as many interviews as I can. But if you have a coach where you're like when you sit down with Coach bar touch again, I want you to challenge him on this and it will hold as a feet. Fire see how he handles it but and wrapping things up today. I want to thank you for joining us. And you know, I want to throw one compliment your way. You have a consistent vernacular that a lot of tenured coaches have at prep when I had the privilege of sitting down with Coach McKenna. He spoke exactly in a similar vernacular of like yourself and kind of buying into the prep way and havin Somethin. And to hold of your own and you know, as far as buying two players and everyone having a role and you know, it's just a variety of things that basically it's just similar words in which he used and you use a as well and so it's I think that's a good sign of a quality coach when someone is already using that, you know, one year after being, you know a head guy and it's the institution to they back us. That's for sure. Yeah. No, that's an excellent point. Right. So let's just say you're out there and you're thinking where is a good place to coach? Where's a good place to send my son or daughter? Where's a good place in which I can just be enthralled in a community. Look no further. I guess it's like an Zagar prep University. We are we're in their pocket, I guess where we are their number one plug. So again, thank you for have or thank you. Well, thank you for having me. Thank you for coming on the program because that means so much to the show and so much the People out there. Yeah Nate thank you pleasure is mine. All right, go puff. So I remind you again. My name is Nathan Alfred. That guy was coach partage. You can look to see more interviews with Coach partage come spring season when he's obviously in the thick of his boys soccer season, but we're going to look to actually pull coach bar touch when he is coaching the girls team coming up this fall. So stay tuned. It's that it's not the last that you've heard of him, but remember, you heard. Erdem here first on PSP and Stay classy out there go pups.","– When Bart Bartow first started coaching high school soccer, he was a 6-foot-7 player who wore the No. 7 jersey—and now he's a 6-foot-6 coach. Bartow, who's in his first year as head coach of the boys' team at Johnny Bartow High School in Florida, tells the Miami Herald he's ""not a huge fan"" of the number. ""I think I have to go with burrito hands down burrito,"" he says. ""It was a very common one and people love to get the burrito get a little bit of the salsa now if you did work, so you did you get salsa. Did I did? Did I did? No, it wasn't as actually a big Didier Drogba fan. He was number nine, but that's the central forward number. I was a Winger midfielder 7 was for me. My mother my brother wore number seven. So I like that."" The Herald notes that Bartow played college soccer at the University of Central Florida, where he was an all-American and was recruited by the NFL's Baltimore Ravens and the NBA's Orlando Magic. He was drafted by the Seattle Seahawks in the third round of the 2011 draft and spent four years with the",0.1306122448979592,0.08163265306122448

This is gonna be my thoughts on the Sundial activity after playing it for a while. It's the central activity in season of dawn thought we should do a video on it. If you're listening to this on iTunes Google play Spotify or watching on YouTube. You can always catch me live at say no to rage.com if you're watching on YouTube hit like subscribe in the belly button helps me out. So the Sundial discussions going to Central around a couple of things like the central point of what I want to talk about is the good the better and the unknown and the reason I need a kind of phrase it this way is we're not all the way done with the activity. There are new things coming in the season there's new bosses. There's new mode. There's lots of things. We haven't really experienced yet. So this is sort of a preliminary discussion about the good it looks like things are going to get better. They've structured some cool things. You might not even be aware of if you haven't looked for them. There's different things in the game right now, you can take advantage of if you are enjoying the Sun Dial and grinding for the weapons are some good things you can do there's things you can do with the Obelisks as well as we had somebody in the community go crazy on the season pass and get really high ranked. If you guys are familiar with Chevy he did that for Science, and we now know some other things so I'm just gonna open up with the good because I actually do enjoy the activity. A lot of people were overly I think have been overly critical of it. The community seems to be enjoying it player base numbers are seem to be fine and and Menagerie was a hit. So I think more menageries a good call. I think it brings the value of the Menagerie with The non failable you can just match make in there. And since it's not failable. It's okay for them to make things kind of intense. If you go in there match made some of the activities might be kind of frustrating if people aren't doing their jobs, you really want to make sure at least some people are running Unstoppable. I like running an Unstoppable bow, and I'm in there those Unstoppable guys can be pretty pesky and then anti barrier as well. That's I think when people are probably going to get the most irritated as if they match make and nobody's running anti barrier or Unstoppable and you're the only one trying Saying that those those enemies can be a bit of a headache but the Silver Lining is that it's not failable. You can't fail the activity. You can get all the way to the end regardless of how it goes and that's good for hardcore players as well. We were going in there and it was taking us anywhere from you know, 12 to like 14 minutes to complete a run. We know we're gone pretty hardcore. We're going pretty organized. Everybody's kind of doing their jobs and there's you know, it is new mechanics if you haven't played it yet. If you're familiar with Gears of War there's Like a hammer of dawn mechanic in the one fight that I thought was really really cool people. Hopefully aren't missing that if you're not paying attention and your buddies are doing all the damage to the boss. You might be missing that there's a really really cool mechanic in the one boss fight that I like. I thought it was a cool new thing that was going on. And if you're a hardcore player that's Spectrum works I think is if you go hard and you're organized you complete it quicker, you're getting more drops more efficiently. If you're more casual and you just matchmaking you're not the contents. Held at arm's length from you. You don't have to grind and get leveled up for it. You can just play and get guns and it's set up really really nicely and it's attached to another grind with the obelisks. Now, we've had people come in and say I don't like the fact that I have to go run patrols were gather resources or do law sectors or public events. You know, why do I need to do all this stuff? I like that. They segmented the grind the fact that I can go and do the obelisks and Ewing the obelisks has a benefit in the game and has a benefit on the planet and it has benefits tied to the actual Sundial activity itself. And if you're going to compare the Sundial to the Vex offensive, I do like that the encounters are not as simple and as easy as the Vex offencive, I wouldn't necessarily call the Sundial hard, but it's certainly a lot more challenging than Vex offensive was especially with the presence of some of those Champions. I find the Unstoppable guys to be the most annoying because they're constantly knocking you back and bouncing you around and I just got one of the new things. Day on the artifact. This is another nice feature of the game is you have different different bills and things that come out but I have this one here if I staggered Ensemble Champion, it's going to temporarily boost weapon damage for Allied players. I'm anxious to try that out and just see how quickly we can get rid of those guys because they can become pretty annoying and pretty pesky. So in light of what I was just talking about with the obelisks and making things better. Let's talk about the better. We talked about the good the better. I do think this activity in the is showing itself to be one that will get better. As you progress through the season I made the mistake of leveling up the Tangled Shore Obelisk. I would focus all your attention on Mars Mars once fully upgraded to level 11 will give you double drops when you get to the end of a sundial run so you can run those obelisks and get those, you know, those increase in drops. The one that I did on Tangled Shore is one that you get I believe I believe it's level 11. I'm sorry 12 on the season pass permanently increase the capacity of Nia Sundial links by one what this is doing is eventually you're going to have all the sundials connected to all I'm sorry all the obelisks connected to the Sundial. So anytime you end it you can pick any of the rewards. You don't have to like do the do the duty of like I gotta go to the you know, I got to go to the planet and you know connect the Sundial and then she's gonna get some point where they can all be connected. And the other thing that's going on with this is that that is making your grind in the actual Sundial more lucrative as time goes on I've I still made the observation that I am a little concerned that the the obelisks have bounties or frames. I'm sorry weapon frames that may be quicker than running the Sundial once all four obelisks are completely leveled up that currency the fractal 'in the fractal lean Harvest Polar Ice crackling. You're not gonna need that anymore once all the Obelisk or fully leveled up and you can buy the frames from the obelisks. Some people have pushed back and said well, but low know you could grab those and complete them. While doing the Sundial and getting multiple drops at the end of every Sundial really maximizing your potential roles that you get here's another permanently increase the number of remaining rewards from the sun dial by one you get that at 32. So by the time it's all said and done you can be ending a sundial with multiple drops. And if you're doing the frames from the obelisks, you can really really increase the likelihood of you getting your God roles. And there's one more thing that thank you Chevy from redeem for doing this. He went crazy. He leveled his season pass up all the way. 292 to see what this was we had the theory here that it was going to be like the augmented frames from Ada. It was just gonna be an extra perk in that last slot and that's exactly what it is. So you're not you're not getting like a different version of the gun. It's just at the final perk Lane, like if you look at a gun and that final perk Lane always has one perk so I'll give an example on the steel feather right now. It's osmosis and there's nothing else you actually have to in that lane to choose from and that mathematically increases the likelihood of you getting a god role. Then you're increasing the chances of getting the perk combinations that you want. Maybe you're looking for vorpal. Maybe you're looking for osmosis. Whatever it is. You're looking for having that at their actually helps. So you have to think of it in this way as the season progresses, you're increasing the amount of drops you get and the drops them selves are also improving as long as you're being, you know weekly and you know doing your bounties leveling up the season pass and leveling up the obelisks. The actual activity itself will get better with time. Time and I think that's exactly how you should craft a limited time event by the end of the season the hardcore players looking for the absolute. Best of the best. God rolls are some really great weapons in there and some good roles some new perks and things that we haven't even had before and those players will be empowered to really chase the absolute best role or the role that they want because the activity gets better over time. Now this all leads to some question marks. Okay. We don't know again if the frames are going to be A lucrative and faster taking the frames into the Sundial activity or just a sundial activity itself. So lastly I want to end with the unknown there are some unknown things here at the gist of it at the beginning here. My impression of the Sundial is they were really really thoughtful about how it's going to feel to progress through the season and how it's going to be to chase God roles. But here are the things that we don't know. What will the new bosses bring are. They going to change anything that's significantly do they have specific drops do they do they change the fight? So the modifiers change in accordance with them? You know does does the encounters leading up to the boss change because the boss is different. We don't know what the bosses are going to bring as the presence. What's hard mode going to do we have no idea. Why is it only Legend? You know, it's only Legend. What's the power level going to be? Is there a reason to even run Hard Mode? What's the impetus is their loot. Is there a reason to run it hard mode Menagerie just was horrible and there is no real reason to run it other than the swords and even that I don't think was a strong enough motivator to go in there and put up with the Deltas in the challenge. So those are some question marks, you know. And next season. How are these guns going to be cycled back in next season? We don't know what's going on with the Vex offensive weapons. Some of the weapons from the Sundial are really really nice. There's going to be an obelisk in the tower. Maybe we'll be able to continue to get them as frames. Maybe that Obelisk will stay in the tower. We don't know anything beyond hard mode. Are there any difficulties be on hard mode? There's a Triumph that says to beat a certain boss at Legend difficulty or higher now is that generic text they slap on everything that was just kind of there as a placeholder and they never went back and change it or does that I mean there's a mode Beyond Legend. Is there a is there anything beyond the hard mode? That's launching in January? What about the armor is just going to be a good role, you know a good place to go for stats the stats on the armor are getting higher the further you get in the season pass. What about the armor that drops in the Sundial mode? What about the arm of the drops in the hard mode of Sundial is it going to have better stats is going to have better stat Trends and then you know, are they going to be any Sundial mods? You know the charge with light mods of the main reason to go toward the new armor sets this season, but are you going to do Anything with mods for the Sundial to make us run it more effectively. Now, they didn't do mods for facts offensive. So that's an unlikely thing. But those are the handful of question marks I have about the event overall. I think the activity is good. It's something fun to go and do and it's going to get more rewarding with time already right now. I think it is pretty rewarding and pretty fun for that seasonal activity. That's match-made and non failable as always we're going to move to question answer if you're listening design. I choose to play Spotify you're watching on YouTube.

It'll bring you right to my twitch Channel. We're going to jump right into the QA. Patrick says what do you think about the trials bug from Friday? I have a whole video on this. So I'm going to give you my CliffsNotes. I think it's clear that trials is very close to returning that placeholder was put there either on purpose or I think maybe because it's coming back this season. A lot of people don't think it is. I happen to think there wouldn't be a whole lot of reason to bring real crafty and dr. Lupo out to bungee in December. They wouldn't be playing and grinding and trying to get weapons and trying to practice if it wasn't if it was coming. Back in the spring that seems all a little bit preliminary like really early. So I think it's coming back this season. I mean, that's why it popped up. I even think it might be called Trials of saint-14. So Geritol. Thank you so much for thirty three months. You're the best and then sunbro. I think I think you for six months. Welcome back. Tian muggle low-riding help. How do I get for weapons linked to the Sundial? Well, you need to have two connections available. So you need to be need level 12 on the season pass or you left the level up tangled Shore. So I would think you got to pick one. I would say go for level 12 on the season pass and then level up Mars to get extra rewards. Then you can have two links which is for weapons double. You 33 how do you feel about the reward output for Sundial? I feel that defensive had more upfront rewards via the chest, but the sundials have a lot more quality to them. Well, I think because they knew. Vex offensive was likely to be the thinnest version of a seasonal activity that they give us. I think they said you know what we better give people tons of rewards. That's what I would think they would need to do as a progressive as a progression you got the first season comes out and Vex defensive is a total throw away. Not like it's a piece of nothing ultimately was very simplistic. Not a lot to it. Well make it really generous. So at least people are going in there because stuffs dropping like crazy in comes the Sundial more complex. It's like the Menagerie there's more to it a big step up from the menageries. You don't the run from activity to activity. They just warp you back and then you run out. I like that a lot. And so If you do the obelisks as the season progresses and you're grabbing the frames and you get the thing fully upgraded, I actually think this is going to be better because it's a little bit more intentional you would end Vex offensive and you could pick one particular frame to have done. Everything else was totally random that dropped so I actually think this is better. It's just gonna take some time for that snowball to get going. But I do I do think the activity by and large is a lot better on the surface. I just think they wanted Vex offensive to feel like stuff was raining on you because the activity itself wasn't that great London Bates Lord. I'm having trouble farming the currency to upgrade my obelisks. I think it's called Polar Ice crackling fully upgraded my Mars Obelisk and I still don't get any drops after Crucible match played 25 games and nothing. Here's the thing Eugene is going to resonate with you on this. He was doing some testing as well. He is come to a conclusion that that perk is broken. It doesn't seem to be having any effect at all. I think I ran five or seven strikes and got to drop like twice. It just doesn't seem to actually work. So you have to wait for the weeklies to start to roll over. There's other sources of fractally no, okay, all three characters should be doing their weeklies on both obelisks. So that's for weeklies per character. That's 12 total weeklies. If you do all three characters and both obelisks weeklies tomorrow on reset the 17th of December, they'll be more obelisks and more weeklies and subsequently more fractal lean. The other thing you can do in the interim while you're waiting for reset is do all the Milestones on all three characters at the Sundial the sundials. Milestone will give you a hundred fractal in per character. Also, make sure you go in and cash in your triumphs. There are triumphs for Season that give you varying degrees of fractal mm. Eventually, I think you do hit a wall where they don't want you to be getting a ton of it rolling over every single week. Because I think they Envision it being one Obelisk a week. If you're dedicating all of your time and resources that you get to one particular Obelisk that means for about a month. You're slowly getting every single one unlocked to somebody that really goes after it maybe three weeks but in general I would say most people are going to take four weeks to get all four obelisks completely leveled up. I think that's totally fine. I don't think they're meant to be like a hop on that day go crazy. Get all you know, get it all done. So before reset tomorrow, I gave you a handful of things you could check and try but other than that, I think they've got it Pace that way on purpose. Big Daddy Patty with three months. Thank you. Morphe says do you think there's a problem with how armor is treated each season each time. They go away and are useless after the season. I get this question virtually every QA. I think you're misunderstanding. The seasonal armor is still important. If you're going to run Garden of Salvation or nightmare hunts those mods slots matter and are super helpful. If you're going to go run Leviathan the mod slots on the Leviathan armor are All and helpful, so I don't think they're invalidating all of your armor at the same time. They have to incentivize you to chase the new stuff. I don't think people always realize what they're asking for if the season of Don armor that you grinded for never needed replaced. That's a significant amount of loot every season that doesn't matter to you at all. And if it was just purely an ornamental grind you would literally get armor to drop and then you'd be done you just like I'm done with that activity. I you know, I got it. Those mods slots matter. It just sucks needed to grind for new armor for the new slots at the proper Affinity in each season. That's no fun. I still think they should allow you to change the Affinity. Once you level of a piece of armor to level 10 one time. Okay, just once because I do feel you on that aspect you could get a pair of gauntlets and you're like, yep. These are the right stat trends that I like. These are the lights lights that roles that I want. You take the time to grind for the materials level at thing. And changes Affinity one time and then you're good to go. I don't think we need to segment the armor grind that freaking much to where you're like, I finally got the stat roles that I want, but it's the wrong Affinity. I you know what I'm saying? So like I think that's the biggest risk with the setup. Now, is there demotivating people from really wanting to chase armor because there's too many barriers between you and getting what you want because you have to think Eugene's like, oh, it's not that hard to get decent status. Tribution, that's not the point. If you're going to motivate hardcores with the men maxing opportunity. They're going to want really good stat roles. They're going to want greats that rolls and I was grinding the dungeon and the raid every week to get my drops and I was never getting anything that that was that impressive. So Bungie has to think about that then and even if you're going to say, well the marginal difference between something with good stat distribution. That is 58 and something that is 65 with terrible. A distribution that's the real issue right is it's not stat total it stat distribution because if you don't care about mobility and you get something that's a 65 but it's got you know 15 on Mobility. It doesn't matter. That's basically a 42 you you know, so you can have something in the 50s with better stat distribution. I would say in general the issue that people have with armor is they have a particular bill they want to go for and that's the main hang-up is oh I this is a really good stat role, but it's the wrong affinity and then that kind of that's kind of a bit of a hang-up. You can't say that in one breath. You can't say. Oh, it doesn't really matter just get decent stats. It has a marginal influence on your Loadout. Okay, you can't say that in one breath. And then in the next breath act like the armor grinds got to be arduous and painful and slow if the benefits are marginal then who gives a Frick if I finally God roll pair of galoshes or boots or something and I take the time and resources to take it to level 10. Let me change the Affinity one time at that point again. I think people push back on this with a contradiction in their argumentation. They say, oh, well, it doesn't really matter. You can go with a decent stat distribution in the mid-50s high 50s. Just wait for the right Affinity. You can't say that the difference is between a 55 and 65 according to the stat distribution is marginal like it has marginal influence over. For your Loadout if it's so marginal than why hold it at Bay. Like why not let people get what they want. I do think the armor grind needs to evolve a little bit. I think bungee focused on the internal mechanism of the armor leveling it up perks rolls Etc. And I think they didn't think beyond that very far with well, how am I going to grind for the one that I want? And then what are they going to do in the spring if we spend this entire season going? Todd roles they have the charge with light mod slot. What are they going to do in the next season, you know where they going to go from there? Because right now I don't even feel like I don't even care about charged with light. I'm I care out of curiosity but it's not like when I started getting mods for the raid or mods for nightmare hunts that change the flow of those fights and it changed my power structure. That's the big question I have is is charged with light even that great. And then what are you gonna do in the next season? Even to make me Chase armor. This is a situation that I think bungee needs to figure out. Now the trick could be the trick could be with the ornamental system. I don't know again if you want to say just run the new activity. And as long as you get a pair of boots, as long as you get five of the arm pieces of drop, you're basically done with the armor grind because they would just be Universal ornaments. I think that would be a danger. I think they could do something with the armor drops and the activity for you, too. Unlock that as an option. So then you're like, well, I'm not really chasing the drop itself, but I'm chasing the ability to have that armor and apply it to what I'm presently wearing. I think there's a significant danger there and saying once you get all the armor, you're done you'll up. I'm done it their all ornaments now. Well, that's not really a grind is it it doesn't take very long and short order you'll have full armor sets, you know. Short order it'll take long. So that that that's a concern that I've had. I mentioned this when they announced armor 2.0 and when they announced Shadow Keith, that's what I said scalability is my big question mark you can create great systems. You can create new incentives new perks new grinds new activities. That's all we know bungee can do that. Is it scalable? Am I going to Care in the spring for that new armor? And how are you going to get me to care? Because in one swing you can't say none of the new armor matters and The next Wing you can't say all the old armor doesn't matter because the seasons are too close together. They're kind of having to walk a tightrope here of your old stuff still matters as well as I want to chase the new stuff too. And I don't quite this is one of the first times I struggle with an answer and a solution because it really is difficult. If you're purely chasing Cosmetics. We're kind of going back to Destiny to year one where the only reason for you to go to NASA saw Rio and grind for the armor set. It was because of how it looked not because it did anything particular to your gameplay. So I actually don't exactly know what the solution would be. Other than maybe if you grind the activity enough and you get enough armor drops, the more you take that armor and break it down the more you get a currency or something for Infusion that can be used to upgrade old armor. So imagine there's a there's new armor sets in the Season and if you grind for enough of those boots, then you break them down and you plug that into your current boots. You're unlocking the the mod slot for That season, you know over time and then when you're done doing that it also then unlocks the ability for you to use it as an ornament or something. I don't know. Beer pie do you think bungee will start to lean more into mechanics doing damage for bosses now with the introduction of the hammer of dawn as you call it. I would like to see some fights take it a step further and have a mechanic to do say 1/3 of the damage to the boss. It's after repeated three times. This will give us something to do other than DPS boss fights. This strikes at the heart of a discussion. We've had many times where I've said. You don't want every fight to feel like oryx. I think there's a time and a place for fights like oryx where you can't beat it any faster than the then the other than the other team, right? It's just make the bombs detonate the bombs make the bombs detonate the bombs you do that four times and then he dies you can stack the bombs and that does shave off some time, but in general if I don't Too many fights to be like oryx. Could there be more fights like that? Yes, first things first. You gotta knock off his shield with hammer a dawn then after you do that maybe something else. Maybe you got to get swords. Maybe you got to get Scorch cans. Maybe you gotta get him to you know, step on a plate like ignites the floor. I don't know like there could be other things like that. I think the biggest barrier between bungee making stuff like that and and not is that stuff tends to you belong in a raid as soon as you start asking match made people to start doing something that requires Synergy or timing. It's going to break down really freaking fast and Menagerie as Luke Smith indicated one of his director's cut they teach you in a menagerie visually what you're supposed to do. You don't need instructions. You don't need a directions. You don't need arrows on the ground. It's just kind of a visual. It's a visual learning process. I think that That limits how much they can require of a team. I would say a lot of what they had is doing Garden of Salvation was a good pivot into Synergy and timing especially with the challenges and stuff Synergy timing, you know mechanics stuff like that. They did a they did a good job of making it to where you got to do things together as a team and time things so that it's not just a DPS bake. You also have to admit that had Garden of salvation. Your two major damage phases the harpy going down the hallway and the big boss going up in the sky. Those are very short windows of damage. So the Harvey going down the hallway is challenging. You gotta have pretty good aim. And then the guy going up in the sky again. You've got to you got to have a solid solid team hitting they're hitting their shots. Because if not, you're going to you're going to run out. Hang on. I got to let my wife know low on creamer. I didn't realize she was going out to the stores. She sent me a picture. asparagus so I would say that mechanics are always a fine fine like line that they can't go too far overboard with if they go too far overboard with the mechanics, then it breaks down. It just it does it breaks down go into Menagerie with a team that doesn't know what the frick they're doing and it can be frustrating and the in the mechanics of Menagerie are really straight are really really straightforward. So they're always having a straddle that line of We don't want things to be mundane and just bake but we also don't want to be so complex that engagement breaks down and and and doesn't go. Well, this is why. I believe they could take the philosophy and the principle of Menagerie and Sundial and apply it in a variety of ways right now. If you really Blitz these activities in Sundial you get to the end quicker right? I'm a sweet cream guy Charlie whiskey giggity you get there quicker, right? And I appreciate that aspect. But what I would do is if I was bungee, let's just imagine the one with the hammer of dawn. That attack room. Okay, I think when you Blitz it and you get it done really really well. There's like let three or four guys come out. Okay. What if every time another one comes out it gets harder more difficult or different or more things are required of you. All right. Number one that's going to give satisfaction to the synergize team. Yes, we pull it off. It's so much harder when you get to the fourth Voss, but to the team that's matchmaking if they're falling. In a part of the seams and they only got like the first of the second boss Beat. There's no harm or foul. They the time runs out and they go to the next area. That's where I think bungee needs to dig in there at that level and say can we make each encounter change and get more complex the further you get so then we could start to turn up the dial of if you make it to phase 4, it's really complex, but it's well worth it. Maybe you get a drop. Maybe you get a random drop if you if you get that done now. A lot of times the push back here, which is probably valid people say if you add extra drops or extra loot incentive for going that distance, then people are going to quit if they're with a bad team. They're going to get angry. I'm like, oh my gosh, we could have gotten an extra drop here, but these frickin numbskulls over here don't know what they're doing. I'm out of here and and toxicity goes up. I don't know if if maybe If maybe the loot incentive is always a danger because that leads to high quick ratios when you're with a bad team maybe instead of that you get a really really big jump like jolt to your imagine. It takes you to different encounters to get to the end. You have the encounter with a hammer of Dawn and then you have the encounter with the the bomb slamming you grow grab the bombs and you bring them back and you slam them but you know, if you can beat the much more challenging and complex. Fourth boss at the hammer of Dawn and counter if you know that's going to shorten the next encounter that's worth it. If it gives you this multiplier or something, so the next encounter is cut in half then you're like that's good for the Hardcore team, right? You're getting to the end faster. You're not necessarily getting more drops from a quality standpoint, but you are over time because now you're beating the sundial in 10 minutes every clip and that's increased drop rates at six drops an hour. That's more than the guys that are matchmaking. I would just always grow concerned about that is number one. If you get if it's too complex teams fall apart engagement goes down. That's not good for the game. If you have incentives for reward and loot tied to playing really really well. Then quit ratios go high toxicity goes up and those more casual players end up feeling like they can't play with anybody because maybe they don't, you know, maybe they don't understand it and it all has to be in Balance because if not, you lose one side of the community. I think he'll try to cater the game way too hard to casuals and don't incentivize the endgame activities. As actually difficult I think what you're saying is not accurate post Shadow key post Shadow keep what you're saying is completely inaccurate if you look at 9:59 any night falls and the 959 any nightmare hunts. I think you're wrong. I think there's lots of stuff in the game and then you go to the dungeon, there's and the garden of Salvation raid and the challenges for garden of Salvation. None of that stuff is catered to the casuals the bulk of the content and Spectrum in Shadow. Keep was not for casual players. At all now, there's a difference between giving casuals and entry point and accessibility and making things casual for them. That is why the structure in Menagerie and Sundial is so brilliant. No one can claim you're keeping it at arm's length. I can't get the stuff. That's not true. It's not even failable and then the hardcores can be like dude. We are cranking through the Sundial every 15 minutes. It's going really really fast and we've leveled up our obelisks and we've level of our season past and weave got a got these extra things and so it's faster and it's more rewarding and more drops and more perks for the hardcore players. So it's cocked Iraq five of the time loss frames have Guardian kills as one of the random objectives to complete for a drop. Do you think it was a good idea to have PVP objectives as possibilities from the obelisks or should have been more intentional and not included it is always weird. To get a bounty that isn't from Shacks that tells me to go to The Crucible. I'm generally just going to delete that. I'm not going to do that. I'm not gonna do that. I'm not going to go into Crucible for a bounty when I can run the Sundial really really quickly, especially near the end of the season and get multiple drops. You're not going to see me taking a frame Into The Crucible. I'll just frickin delete it especially think of it like this. We did the math and once all four obelisks are leveled up. If you do your weeklies and your Sundial Milestones on all three characters, you're going to end the week with like 2700 of the fractal lean and it's like 10 fractal lean to buy a frame. So the only reason to have fractal in at that point is to buy frames and if you get a frame that's going to take you to The Crucible. You're probably just going to delete it. It's only ten fractally. That's probably what a lot of people are in up doing. Next question is from Pescador de muerte. How should a limited time player maximize the grind in season of dawn every week take care of your Obelisk weeklies and your Sundial milestones and just anytime you're doing anything be grabbing bounties and then you'll be leveling up your season pass your artifact and you'll be getting better drops and more drops from Sundial as the season goes on. So I wouldn't it I wouldn't ignore the obelisks and the weeklies or the Sundial milestone. Arcanist while I understand bungee needs to incentivize us to chase the new armor with new mod slots every season. There's really no great way to get good stat rolls on the seasonal armor. How do you think bungee can address this? I don't honestly know what the answer here is. Like when you grind for a gun, okay, there's a different grind that's going on there because you want three perks that work together. And when you're grinding first at rolls on Armor, you're looking for numbers in a lane that's going to contribute to your overall build. So it's not as it's not as like singular. I guess nine months from now Wheezy. Thank you. As a PVP player I respect you wanting to get us some quality of life instead of just telling us to go freak ourselves and play another game. Thanks for having our back. Oh, yeah. I tweeted at the other day about that would've been a good Improvement for the PVP guys. It's more singular. It's like this gun is either good or it's not and with armor It's just tough. It's like this pair of boots might be bad for your build but good for another in general a bad roll on a gun. It's not that subjective. If you get hip fire grip on a sniper and I don't know something else. That just isn't going to help you then. You're no one's going to like, well, that's great for my build. Maybe not I mean Justin, Hands, so most of the time though a bad role on a gun isn't that subjective? You just you get perks that don't do much for you, you know, like head Seeker people think head Seekers great, but it's really not it doesn't do anything. So, I don't know how you give us intentionality towards something that is so minut but when stacked up when stacked up all those stats on all those individual armor pieces adds up to a greater whole there's there's more to it than just a perk on a gun. Sorry, I had to take a drink of water. so I don't I don't know how to give you intentionality there because if you're like, I just want tons of recovery and discipline and they give you tons of intentionality there. I think the danger would be you're going to get maxed out tears in discipline and intellect and Recovery. And then the danger would be you now never ever need to go for anything else ever again. And that's the thing with guns. Right? We got a bunch of God roll guns, but now there's new guns. Now, there's new perks. There's new things for you to chase that you didn't have before and I think that is one of the things I that that helps it feel fresh and new with guns every season. They can throw in just a couple of things. They throw in just a Coppola perks and a new grenade type and all of a sudden were like we're in there. We're in there grinding and Totals just aren't as interesting. So once you get really good stat rolls is going to be really hard to motivate you to chase new armor. But you can add perks of the season pass an increase your stat totals like have Perks it increased at of energy capacity on the season pass armor. They already have Perks it increase your stat totals though. They have six of them. They have intellect discipline in strength, and then they have recovery mobility and resilience and already exists there already are perks that do that there already are mods do that. Now if you're feeling about perks on the armor itself. Now you're getting into more layers of complexity. Now, you're going to need two layers of complexity that has the armor has Affinity the armor has 6th at totals and the armor has perks that can randomly role. That might be too much. Dark seraphim. Do you think the amount of fractal lean drops from Sundial is too low or is it appropriate for that level? Is there possibility of increasing I think it's fine. We kind of address this a little bit ago. We dress has a little bit ago. It is a it seems to be structured to where if you really push for it. You're maximizing one Obelisk a week. And I think that's totally fine. Oh you're talking about season pass perks. I don't know. Yeah, maybe there's a difference between losing an oppressive Darkness mod and you losing like 20 discipline just cuz I don't know, that'd be weird right you'd structure all your armor you'd get set and then all the sudden you just lose a bunch of stats one season into the next. I don't know Anakin Starkiller with 34 month. So close to three years. Welcome back. Dr. Cleveland, do you feel the level 92 in the season pass unlock an extra perk for your weapon drop is a test for weapons 2.0 update is this in line with your thoughts about how weapons can be updated in the future? I do not think that's what it is. This has been in place since the black Armory a year ago Ada had augmented weapons that just an extra perk was just in that slot. It pulled from the same perk pool. It was just an extra option. So you're like, oh I didn't get out la Kill clip. Oh wait. Yes. I did one of those is like an Something it just increases it just increases the likelihood of you getting a god roll. That's all Eugene says, no, no a perk in the season pass that would increase the potential stat role of your armor drops for the entire rest of the season. It wouldn't go away. Oh, so the season pass would affect my drops not affect my stat totals. I mean I could see that they have all those perks that you unlock at the bottom and they could have won that like I don't know as the season goes on near the end. It's like oh your armor can now drop with you know, an extra ten total stats, you know. I don't know. It's one of those things where I do think I don't think necessarily bungee quite knows how they want to do it just yet because if they it's one of those things I'm telling you if they give us too much control, we're all going to get God to your stats and then you're never gonna want to take that armor off right now the this is weird to say but the benefit of me not getting any great stat roles in season of the undying is that if I get something new that's a little bit better. It's really really easy to put it on and invest in it. The only reason this is the thing to that's kind of weird. The only reason I was leveling up my armor. During season of the undying is so I could put perks on mods on them. Because I wanted to run Nightmare hunt mods. I wanted to run my mods to that gave me increased reload or increased recovery or whatever. That was. The only reason I was leveling up my armor. I was leveling up any of my armor because I was like, oh, this is a god roll. This is a god roll piece right here. I wasn't doing that. I 100% was not looking at any of my pieces and saying this is an absolute God roll. I got to take this with me in the next season. I got a really level this one up with I just wasn't so I'm not really sure if they're going to want to give you intentionality. I think they're gonna want to give you intentionality over the guns because it's more clear if a gun is good or not. It's way more subjective. If you get God to your armor stats to what you're trying to build and if they give you too much too many God rolls that's gonna be really really hard to motivate you The Following Season unless they do something kind of arbitrary like they did this season where they said there's these new mods charged with light and you can't even try them out if you don't get new armor. r Yo, yo G mitsui says what do you think about there not being a raid this season. Do you think the new dotting seasonal content matches up to the cost without the motivation of a new raid Pinnacle activity? I think it's fine. I think people overstate the value of a raid. I also think for $10 expecting a raid in addition to everything else. They did is is just not really in line. I got people that are going nuts on my YouTube to like you You state every time that it's only ten dollars. That's not a good enough excuse low know and it's like the one guy said nobody asked for this. We didn't ask for ten dollars Seasons every couple of months. Really because the player base numbers seem to say otherwise and the old way of doing things with the droughts was terrible like was what was terrible going to going back to the way we did it before you spent 60 for the base game and then 30 for the DLC season pass for Osiris and wore mine. I don't I don't know why anybody would want to go back to Osiris warmind or House of wolves? Dark below. I don't know why you'd want to go back to that. I think if you look at the structure of the game where we had like kings fall and then nothing or rise of iron and then nothing and you compare it to this system that we have now, I think for $10 we're getting exactly what we've all grown and accustomed to love which is a hobbyist live service game. That always has something going on and I think that I think that's a really really good good system. I think it's working well, and I don't know what's going on with the tracking though. The tracking of the player base numbers is like glitched. It says there's like a hundred thousand players online right now just on PC. Okay. They've Dave's erode them out. Yeah, the the tracking over the weekend was glitched. It was like there's 89,000 players presently on PC, but then it said that only Thousand and played the previous day and I'm like that that can't be right there can't be that many people playing right now at this moment. And then that's the number of people that played yesterday. That's like that's like mathematically impossible. That would mean that only those people logged in and played and then they don't nobody play for the rest of the day. I think when bungees been doing their background maintenance where they've been disabling API access and some of those third-party programs and dim and stuff. I think that's probably messing with the player tracking. Ng Cassie's article ran with your trials of saint-14 idea. Did he say anything about me or is he just I'm not the one that I don't think it's original to me. I think other people have said it snow Ravens. Do you think the Pinnacle grind is over with level increase each season? I just don't care about it. I don't know. It just doesn't seem to matter. I don't need to now I've Legend drops, and we suddenly feel the need to level sure. But by the time Legend gets here. We're going to have padded numbers pretty significantly padded numbers from the from the artifact. I'm already like a plus 6 almost a plus 7 and that's after a week 15 months from insane Dutch. Thank you. So I don't I don't know what they're going to really do with leveling. I'm fine with it going away. Just let us play and grind for gear every season and the season pass in the artifact can give you your sense of leveling and progress dad bod United maybe asking for advice. I fell in love with D2 around curse really found myself with the itch to play again. I picked up all the DLC and I've been loving my time back in the game. I'm feeling overwhelmed with where to start and what to do because I've been away so long I find myself jumping in and just ending up in strikes a crucible any advice on how to tackle Quest objectives. Should I pick a planet and go Where would I start? I mean this is a really specific question, but I wouldn't be surprised. If a lot of people feel this way like yeah, I took a break and I came back and I don't really know where to set my sights. Like there's there's so much A lot of times too much too much content can make people feel a sense of futility and that sense of futility and almost like helplessness. You just sort of lock up and you're just going with what's familiar what I would say if you have season of Dawn I would set my sights. Sights on Osiris and play through that stuff with him. He has a story mission that he doesn't really promote. You got to go like talk to him and you go and you interact with saint-14 I would do that before tomorrows reset because there's going to be another version does he like another story Mission probably this coming week and then the other thing I would do is I would just go to the Tangled Shore and Mars and work on the obelisks do their weeklies get that fractal lean stuff cash in your triumphs spend that fractal lean. I would focus on doing the Mars one first. And you can always do what I call round robin. If you just if you just wanted some pretty like laid back easy breezy content that benefits you go to every planet starting with the EDC and just go around robbing go easy go easy. Then you go to tighten. Then you go to Mars. Then I owe then Mercury then nessus you just kind of go around in a circle. and you grab the bounties from the NPC on that planet, there's only three and do them all and if you do that with another person and you get the bone, you know the bonuses from XP or whatever, you'll move your artifact and your and your and your season path along at a pretty good clip and That's something else to do that that also gives you a benefit leveling up your season pass in your artifact is also a benefit and then you can always just grind the Sundial once you get your obelisks kind of level up and they're connected you can grind the Sundial and try and get some good guns from there. Have you heard that twitch has been sued by three billion dollars what I mean by three billion dollars mean for three billion, who are they being sued by the piper? Would you entertain the idea that the wish Ender bug is bungee playing around with buffing bows and tracking Community strong response to them. I don't think so. I don't think so. I would think that. It's just well, maybe they went in and try to tweak a perk or something and it fiddled with something. I don't know. I mean maybe that maybe they were fiddling with the perk and they they over fiddled. It's possible. It's possible that they were like, hey. You know, it's possible. They were fiddling with something and trying to like quietly help bows. And it did they kind of did it by accidents? It's supposed to on Livestream fail and what they're sued for I've not heard about it. So if you feel like putting some of the details in chat, I've not heard about twitch being sued for three billion dollars. This is what the frick vertov. What is Destiny needs going into D3 that makes them in game we One I believe things like the obelisks are great ideas that need to be living more in different ways make it I'm this is not a question filthy. Do you think having such potential influential seasonal mods in an overall pot as an overall positive for the current grind between inventory woes and time spent grinding undying armor. I personally find myself caring much less this season 4 mods that that will still be not be usable on new armor in three months. I don't know. I mean they definitely need to I think they need to think this through because I definitely see where you're coming from. Like if every season were like well we gotta get new armor. Now, I think that can be a little bit frustrating. Maybe there's something that we do every season to upgrade that armor slot kind of how we said like leveling could be slot related. There could be something thats related to the slot itself and we just grind for the armor cosmetically I just Now if that's the right call a Russian Media company for pirated streams of league matches. Oh, it's a suit in Russia about a soccer game. Well, it sounds like it sounds like people have been using twitch for you know, probably showing stuff. They're not supposed to show which gives Credence to what I've been saying for a while now twitch should not let any old person just stream. I believe you should have to go through an application process if you're going to stream on their platform because it's not like you'd see where you upload the video and there can be a process in the background that checks the video for its legitimacy or copyright material just to protect YouTube. You can go live on Twitch and go unnoticed for X number of hours sometimes streaming so that you have no business streaming like you could literally do a prop up brand-new brand-new stream and Streamlight copyrighted movies and then all your buddies could then go download them from that from that vaad like that. This programs let you do that so Twitches got to think about that. You can't just let people live stream and because again if they don't put themselves in a directory, there's a lot of things that could go into them, you know, doing stuff like streaming soccer games and stuff and you just again, you just don't put yourself in the directory and tell all your buddies and you kind of share your pay-per-view with them like that. They've got to think through that stuff Ashton Hollow. What what what would you say to people who say Destiny has turned into nothing more than a bounty checklist as more seems to be the only way to progress this seems like a pretty uh, pretty shallow criticism. I think there's a lot more going on in the game. You don't just do bounties bounties are complementary to what you're already doing. So I'm going to go run strikes. I can grab bounties while I'm doing strikes if I'm going to run the Sundial I can grab bounties while I'm doing that now there is a bounty drive when you want to currency and I think that's okay. I think there's something satisfying about grounding a bounty getting the check mark getting the stuff. On the Bounty as opposed to just as I've said many many times if you just sit there and run the the Sundial all day every day and nothing else you're going to get. I really I really think you're going to get bored like really really fast and that would be my largest concern about not segmenting it so bounties and things that seem more more menial and more tedious. I think are a really good way to change things up a little bit so that These aren't complementary to those of us who do mostly rating right, but that's kind of if you're if you as a player are going to come and engage with an admittedly very small slice of the game. That's more on you than bungee. Like they can't give you like a thousand raids, you know, they if like, well, I just really like running strikes Crucible or raise whatever if you pick a small slice of the game and that's all you do. It's it's not really fair to then turn. I'm like, well, it's just nothing but a bow He checklist. It's like are you doing any of the other things in the game are did you grind for the rituals? Are you doing Sundial? Are you leveling up the obelisks? Are you doing just like the round-robin like I do just to change things up to level your artifact in your season pass like you know mean they can give you about is I can complete in raids. Oh, I see what you're saying. They're not complimentary if you're just running rates because there aren't enough bounties for raids that Harkens back to a suggestion that I've had for. I think since yes since Benedict showed up with Leviathan, I have been saying we need a raid NPC that I can level up by running raids. So if you run more than three that week you can get more experience and level up that NPC they could have bounties they could have ghost sparrow and ornaments. That are earned within that season for running that raid like crazy. It would've been pretty dope to run Garden of Salvation extra times for extra XP and you know have some dailies and repeatable is on there. And then when you're doing that you're getting further and so let's say at the end of season of the undying you get a raid NPC rank of 80 and you get a bunch of cool stuff because of that and your guns look different your raid guns, your radar more looks different because of the ornaments that you got from that. Great NPC I still think I still think we need to raid NPC now Eugene's making a pretty good point a pretty good push back. You can grab the raid challenge bounties. Well, not for a garden. There wasn't a real challenge many but there's a raid Clan Bounty gunsmith bounties can be completed in the raid. The Vex offensive bounties were completed in the raid. There was actually quite a few boundaries you could do while in the raid now, but there are trade bounties. I think that's kind of the point. I think a raid NPC Be a nice upgrade for raid Grinders it number one. It'd be a really easy way for Bungie to say hey, there's now A Reason to Run The Raid more than three times and it's sort of external from the ray of the not that going in like Tinker with drops or fiddle with rate itself. Just do it externally with an NPC beer pie. How would you feel if Master working seasonal armor during the season would unlock it for you for ornamental use it would give an incentive a Masterwork armor. So you're saying if I Masterwork the seasonal armor during the season it would unlock it as an ornament. This is kind of what I was getting out a little bit ago like the idea that if you take the time to do something particular with the armor, maybe you unlock it as an ornaments. I don't dislike this idea. I grow concerned about space in the database of the game like from a technological standpoint. We're going to get really really bloated with ornaments. Now maybe bungee could do something where you go into collections and you can only have so many ornaments active. So you've got to like, okay. I want like you have your five how would they even do this? You have like five boxes and you go to those boxes and say I want these ornaments to be active for helmet Gauntlet, you know, you'd go to helmet and say I want these ornaments active like I'm gonna be switching between these ones. I kind of like these ones. I don't know I think Would I think he would start to run into a bit of a bloat a bloat problem with with the ornaments there are already a lot in there because they just kind of gave us the ones from the ever verse which was a nice gesture, but it did it did fill up the the ornament section pretty pretty quickly and the other the other concern I have on the back end of this. Is your you're running the risk of turning armor grind into a purely cosmetic Chase and I'm always hesitant to endorse that because that didn't work in D2 is launched and I know DTS launch was really thin. So maybe I'm picking an extreme version of chasing chasing Cosmetics, but if you're only chasing armor because it's pretty My question would then be when are you chasing stats? When are you chasing armor for a particular for a particular reason? So Trey says first time you are already have me hooked. How do you feel about the seasons ritual weapons? How easy or difficult? I think it's nice that they're not that difficult Bunji. I got this question another time and bungee feels like they want to meet the One season to feel front heavy because if they're front heavy that's when most people play most people are playing that. Tweak that first month and if that first weekend month feel really really fun and rewarding for the Lion Share the community. Then I would say that that's a good thing. Oh, man, I spent $10 and you know, I hit it pretty heavy there for a couple weeks and it was fun. I got some new stuff and you come back every season kind of anticipating that front heavy feeling it's weird to have like a front heavy season and then say hey these cool new weapons we offered. There aren't a lot of new weapons and just in a few of the ones that we did offer out of the out of the very small that we did offer. It's gonna take you like the whole season to get do you see I'm saying I get where people are coming from because they're like dude it took me the entire season to get the not forgotten. It's like you're all your awesome. You're cool man that that was an achievement. I didn't get that. I didn't get that freaking gun good for you, but that doesn't mean that needs to be the way that it is every single time. Perhaps Perhaps bungee could look into like an ornamental system for the rituals. There's only three of them and so maybe that would be like when you went from you got your Luna's house and you went for the not forgotten you could get your your ritual weapon. And then the long grind for the more hardcore would be unlocking an ornament or something. That would be that would be my first initial idea maybe I do like the fact they make the seasons front heavy. I think that does the game in the community. It serves them well to have it be front heavy. I also think they've swung the pendulum really hard. So you have people that are like you got to be kidding me. I spent the entire season trying to get Randy's and now people are getting this other one really really quickly. Yeah, okay, but, you know Randy's compared to a side armor or the linear Fusion. You know what I mean? I I think they're I think ritual weapons are falling right into the lane that they're supposed to fall into their Kind of like I don't want to use the word gimmick, but they're just like a unique kind of fun weapon that isn't it. It's not you're not grinding for the recluse or the or the not forgotten anymore. It's just change its moved away from that. Listen, they've admitted that Pinnacle weapons as a concept created lots of problems, which then means they're probably evolving out of the game. And this is their way of evolving them out of the game. They're just going to call them. Well every season they're going to be neat. They're not going to be unique in their perk roles because other guns can get those perks and they're not going to be that particularly hard to get and I don't I wouldn't call that a mistake or a problem. I would say that's just kind of the Natural Evolution of them saying you know what this was a huge problem and we can't do this anymore and a way to slowly boil that frog in the water is to slowly like take down how great they are and how hard they are to get and they're just there. Rhythmic injection of stuff that you got free activities. You got rituals. You got a new activity. You got a season pass you got an artifact. There's kind of all these things that are dropping. You know, when you think we'll see old ruins return September of next year King boxer. Not sure if someone asked this yet, but was Osiris not having daily bounties a missed opportunity Seasons, not over yet. We don't know what Saints bringing so I don't want to say it's a missed opportunity. Next we don't know exactly what's going to happen. Also Osiris brings with him for obelisks that will if our assumptions are correct will be eight weeklies per character Smoky dailies do seem to be missing but we'll see Smokey gaming since the obelisks are free to everyone. Would you necessarily mean that they wouldn't leave after the season Paul Tassie seems to think it doesn't have a seasonal symbol. Just curious what you think. I like where Paul's heads at. I didn't look at the The obelisks are 100% going away at the end of the season because they are tied to the sun dial. Their purpose does is it needed after the Sundial is expired but but the towers getting one and when we went to light Gigi, every single frame has an obelisk planet and then they all every single one of them also can be gotten at the tower Obelisk according to the database which I believe that means the tower Obelisk may just in Endure so you if you didn't get the frame you wanted you can always just hit up the frame and the tower spring season. It'll still be there and there are three that can only be gotten at the tower Obelisk the can be gotten on the planets. It's the to it's the sniper from the season pass the rocket from the season pass and the perfect Paradox. They don't have a plan an obelisk. But the rest of the weapons that do have a plan of the Obelisk also all can be gotten at the tower according to the database. So it's likely The tower Obelisk sticks around and the planetary ones are don't because the planetary ones are the ones that you connect to the Sundial. I don't know if we're going to be connecting the tower one to the Sundial want to wait and see I think we're going to be doing that. This week was saint-14 during the daunting. Arson at dawn. Are you a fan of bonuses being did I skip a question there? No, I didn't. Okay, are you fan of bonuses being added to the season pass that can alter the guns given the season I'm a fan of the double perk final column of the saint-14 Armory, but dang It's a Grind to get to rank 92 if I want ample time to get the better versions. You have to understand that. It's not a better version It's a mathematical probability increase right now. You might say no. No. No, it's a better version because I can switch between two perks depending on the encounter. Okay? Sure. Yeah. Okay, you get one with vorpal and you get one with osmosis maybe there's times where you want to do that but I would argue that the guns themselves aren't that much better and and it doesn't take that long to get to the to a hundred. It does it and we have a longer season than we did was season of the undying so the people that care about that. Thing about a gun with an extra perk are hardcore players more than likely and they're going to be logging in enough. I would think to hit a hundred within a reasonable time frame to get that benefit of the Season couldn't you argue that's pay-to-win content what's pay-to-win content? You have to elaborate. There's nothing pay to win the game presently because pay to win means you buy something that gives you an in-game advantage like a really God roll shotgunner our hand Cannon. Thing imagine saint-14 shotgun with demo trench or 1/2. So now the shotgun fulfills roles based on my class choice. So yeah, they're okay. That's true Eugene. There are potentials for double God rolls again. I think we'll all if you care about that if you care about that Eugene, I would think you and anybody else like you is gonna hit 92 at a pretty at a pretty reasonable clip throughout the season. I mean not everybody is going to do what Chevy did because Chevy's a mad lad but I think I just hit 20 something tonight. I mean I'm a fifth of the way through and you know what, I mean, and it's for one week. So I think a lot of us are gonna get there pretty quickly. Give a better chance to get a better role if you purchase a season pass by leveling up to 92. I don't really have time or patience to entertain the pay2win thing because I think the fact that you're here and typing that up. I think you're smart enough to figure that out on your own that it's not pay to win because that's not what pay-to-win is pay to win is when I go and say give me a god roll gun or a one hit kill gun that will give me a tangible measurable benefit in PvP. Let somebody else can't get unless they spend money. That's pay to win anybody that's ever tried to argue. The season passes paid win or the Exotics on the season Pastor pay to win. Those arguments are just absolutely silly. That's the nicest way. I can say it. They're silly. If you bought if you bought dark below there were guns in there. You couldn't get without the season pass you could argue that was pay to win. So Bungie has apparently been doing pay to win since dark below because any time they've expanded the game. And it's looped pool. You get more loot with you spend money. So I just think it's a ludicrous position. SMN says I'm kind of stuck with the obelisks. I'm level 18 on the season pass and I can only access one of the reward tiers both Mars and Tangles or obelisks are Level 4. I've yet to find any help and I'm wondering what I'm missing all three characters. If you do all your weeklies, that's a lot of weeklies and then your three milestones at the Sundial and then cash. All your triumphs you should have enough to level one of those guys up all the way because my Mars ones at four and my Tangled Shores at 11:00. So you may be having cash in your triumphs. Maybe you haven't done the weeklies on all three characters maybe haven't done the Milestones on all three characters, but that's how I did it. Servo actuator do you think trials will be back next season because the season of dot I think is potentially the season it's going to be trials saint-14 going to skip because we've already dealt with that a lot today Gold Heart cold heart. I'm sorry. Do you know what max level is for each Obelisk. I'm eleven on the Tangled Shore. There's no more upgrades a few can keep going. We don't know why you would need to or have to wait and see but presently nothing happens Beyond 11 that you would really want to keep dumping, you know stuff into it for thankless work. What are Expectations for the summer season being with the described it as a time like never before in Destiny. I'm really intrigued and finding myself looking forward to it. Love your content. Thank you. I believe that Bungie will pull at many threads to come together into one thrust in the narrative toward September which will be savathun in the Dreadnought and I believe when they pull all those threads together. It's possible they will also then pull all the planets all the activities all of it together. So the summer ER is like this it'll be like age of Triumph like the celebratory time to do anything and everything just grind City and that leads us like a crescendo to savathun in the Dreadnaught. But that that's that's what that's the only that's the best I can do is a theory I don't think it has anything to do with the triangle shifts. I think triangle ships are tucked away as an ever-present threat in the narrative that will come into play in the next game not in Destiny to but that's these are obviously just theories. Oh, I'm sorry. Smm says, I figured it out. You have to reset them to open up both. Okay. Let me make sure this makes it into the podcast smm. I misunderstood your question. And this was a problem that I encountered you get to the point where you can have two sundials connected to I'm sorry, I'd always say it wrong. You can have two obelisks connected to the Sundial. So when you end there's four guns to choose from okay, once you unlock the ability to do that, you have to go to one of the sundials and you have to reset all connections and then connect the two individual ones. It's a little silly, but it's the way that At it set up. So if you've unlocked the ability to have more than one Sundial I did it again. If you've unlocked the ability to have more than one Obelisk connected to the Sundial but only one is connected. You have to reset the connections and then connect both Tangled Shore and Mars. It's kind of a have you tried turning it off and back on again situation. And that's the that's the workaround. So if you're running into that, I am sorry, I misunderstood your question. Hopefully nobody who hearing the podcasts like off Rick. I have the same problem and he doesn't understand what we're trying to. Fix so that is how to fix that.

Hey guys, welcome back to another episode of the fashion school dropout today. I'm going over the topic that I probably get asked about the most and that is how to start your styling career. Now, I'm just going to jump right in one of the biggest steps to move in up in your style and career. I'm about to share is really no secret. You heard it many times before but it has to be said again. And again, it's interning now. I know no one wants to hear it, but it's really the best and fastest way to Move forward in your career and I'm going to explain how and why in just a moment. So when you in turn you get to learn the ins and outs of the game under a more seasoned stylist and this is variance in itself is super valuable. No matter how you go about it. You just can't skip this step. I mean I you can but it'll be extremely hard for you to get anywhere really. So with that said it's a good idea to start building your portfolio by doing test. Shoot that show off your You're styling skills. And I mean your styling skills. Not only do test shoots. Let you show off your eye for style, but they'll help you be able to book your own jobs down the line. Now, I mentioned your styling skills and I emphasize that because the last thing you want is to intern and assist someone for five years and then you get a spy will job by yourself, but you had no portfolio to show the photographer or the creative director and no matter how many shoots you help God. You can't include another Styles work in your book or your portfolio, even if you assisted so it's their work, not your so test shoots are definitely the way to go. So if you don't know what test shoots our test shoots are not only for building your portfolio, but there are also amazing for building up your contacts. So basically a test shoot is when a bunch of creative such as the photographer Silas makeup and here are is they get together and they create shoot just for portfolio content now, These people that you meet on shoes, they can help you build up your portfolio and your network. Now the biggest mistake I see young stylist make is trying too hard to network up instead of networking with people who are on their same level. Now. I always say networking horizontally or laterally is the way to go your creative peers. They'll be the ones to refer you to the job and who knows the photographer that you meet on a test shoot they could be shooting for Vogue. Harper's Bazaar in five years and if you maintain a good relationship with that person guess who they're going to call it a style that cover. It's probably going to be you now. I know you may be thinking like that's cool and all but I live in a small City. Well, even if you don't live in a big city like LA or New York here is some way to start building your portfolio. So I hope you all are taking notes. So the first one is Instagram, so if you're anything like me You're on it all day every day. So why not use it to your advantage? So if you see a photographer whose work that you absolutely love go ahead send them a message offering its Alva South earn it shoot it's a win-win situation. So you get new photos for your book. The photographer gets elevated photos featuring amazing clothes that they otherwise they wouldn't know how to where to find or how to put different outfits together. So the way that you can find photographers in your city, no matter Where you live is simply by searching up the hashtag with your city name and then photographer. So if you live in Atlanta, you've searched up hashtag Atlanta photographer or hashtag ATO photographer and hashtag Atlanta photographers with Sapporo. So you want to use every variation get creative so that goes if you live in Houston or Dallas, you've searched up hashtag Houston photographer hashtag guy was photographers simple as that just to get started. Edited and a lot of people tend to forget that Instagram. It's a photo search engine. So use it to your full advantage because Lord knows I do. So that's one of the ways that I got my start another way is Craigslist now, I know you might be looking at me crazy right now, but with all things use your discretion with this one, so if something was too good to be true it probably is and I know Craigslist doesn't have the best reputation to say the least. But they do have great job in Gig opportunities here and there from time to time. So in fact, that's how I got my start, you know, Instagram and Craigslist because I responded to a posting from a photographer who was seeking the stylist for a magazine editorial and that was one of my first published editorials and that magazine they ended up calling me back style more their covers which led to even more opportunities and that was still In the very beginning of my career, but I already had a couple of photos of my portfolio because I went to Fashion school and I had photos of my own design which leads me to the Nets way to build your book which is our schools.

You can be a source of mutual support So connect with photography students from your local art school or art college who are interested in shooting fashion and use this as an opportunity to build both your portfolio's. I promise there's photography students. They're who they have no idea how to find a stylist just like you probably have no idea where to find a creative team where to find a photographer's for your ideas. So you guys got to find each other and you know, this is one of the great places to start now last but not least one of the easiest way to build your portfolio and styling is getting some good shots of your friends. So I think we all have that one friend who thinks their model. So go ahead and use that to your advantage so you can utilize your iPhone or if you have a DSLR that even better go ahead and dress up your Mo's Model S friend and just go for it your first images. No one's expecting them to look like Vogue and the point of it is to just show off your creativity and your styling skills. And this is how I did my very first test shoot. So I remember it was the summer after graduation and I just got some friends from college got a bunch of clothes for my friends. My sister and I even went thrifting like I head up the Good Will and the Salvation Army for some you know, for some cool stuff. And this is before I knew about showrooms and all that and we just kind of went we went for it. Like it was fun. It was a fun day of shooting like the model got changed in the car wasn't even like a quote-unquote real model is my friend Tina and it's just great to look back on those first shoes and just see how far you've come. So that's the bottom line just Art, so many of you guys are waiting for that perfect moment that perfect opportunity. Like the perfect moment doesn't exist is what you make of it. So just start from where you are doesn't have to be perfect. Just go for it and you will figure it out. I promise you, you know, we all got to start somewhere and I did too.

Hello hello and welcome to v. No nothing the podcast where I probably know just as much as you but with a glass of wine in my hand. I know even less. Maybe way less. I am Lucy from Lucy on the ground the mean / pop culture Instagram account that talks about everything from what the hell Kanye is doing with this church to why Meg Ryan is a rom-com goddess. Yeah, we're gonna get into that tonight with me against his will once again is the one and only Bill welcome Bill hello to your living room. Thank you for last week. You actually promoted me. Your Facebook and also begged anyone to replace you as the guests. I'm also your booking agent now to yeah, it's a few just taking all the I didn't hire you for that. Yeah, how's it going? I had a couple of responses. You might have some quality acts lined up coming up. I feel like I saw some of those responses and some of those are not didn't say they were all quality. I just had a couple quotes. Okay. Well, we'll see you guys but a lot of you have spoken out and he refuses to accept this but You are in demand with this podcast people enjoy it. That being said you did this weekend on Thursday drop like, oh, I'm famous. Casually. No. No, I just need you to know that I'm gonna have some Flex sometimes uh-huh. Uh-huh. Well, usually we start this off with us realizing how much we drink this weekend. We're usually suddenly like no we only drink One day at four days and suddenly we're really concerned about ourselves. But this weekend didn't drink we did good. We just didn't want to we drank Thursday and that's when Bill we went to a drag bar and watch RuPaul's Drag Race and it was awesome a drag. It was at Sidetrack in Chicago. It was so I've never been before unreal the crowd was so into it and then they did a drag show in between everything. Nothing, the hosts were amazing. But when I said to Bill I was like are you sure you want to go with it? Go to this he goes. Well, I'm famous. Like of course I can go. So that's what he dropped it. That's what I'm referencing. Also. I had been to that bar. And I know it was a pretty fun time. Anyway, it's seven rooms. Its mass its you get lost. It was a it was packed though everywhere. It's not just like one room had this big TV and that's what know everywhere. It was amazing. I enjoyed it. But I also feel great because we drank Thursday we drink a bit. But then we no shots. No, but and we were out still late. Yeah, and then drank didn't drink Friday or Saturday and then we have dabbled in a glass of wine tonight. What are we drinking tonight bill or a bottle tonight? We polished off a bottle of Kings clay Cabernet Sauvignon 2017, but I got last week some of you might have seen on my story. My subscription again that I'm always meeting to cancel first Leaf I've had for years it comes every like three months just because it was coming once a month and that was excessive for me. So I changed it to three months. So I always forget then 2 cancels. It's so absurd subscription and it came last week and that was where the bottle was from and it was pretty good. Yeah. I mean the first sip we were kind of like most worried about it tasted very peppery kind of had interesting. Fruit notes to it. But by the end of the second glass I was like, yeah, I mean I could keep drinking if I wanted to right now. I feel like you're I can't even quote Parent Trap to you because she's always like well because they're terrible parents. No, we watch that. No smell terrible. I didn't mean to segment into this they are not terrible. Shadowing so it's episode. So when we do drink the wine those specially when it comes in this box, what we like to do is take a sip and guess how much that bottle of wine cost and tonight the Kings clay I had guessed was about a $10 bottle you had guy said 15 and you can find it at a discount wine store for about 17 or regular retailer 422. So this one incident, yeah, the the wine box worked out that means the other five bottles. We got probably are worth five dollars a clip but Kings clay wasn't bad. Well, of course, that's the one we picked to start off with and the first step. We were like, yeah, and then once you Google that we're both like well, that's what finish my second glass and I've been contemplating. Oh that was your third glass because I did I barely got a second glass. So once again on the second class the same no, I already had some of my glass what I had when I polish off the rest of the bottle. No, once again, you did that you'd always have more than the same time this time this time at least I'm not wrong. You just you're tricking me. All right. So like I said tonight we did drink last episode. We were just like no we're having water we were done. So couple glasses. We're feeling good. We'll see how much we slur right and Bill honestly needed a few glasses because this is going to be an episode for him. This is not the beginning he'll be into but his Nemesis comes Zup, Kardashian. Hmm But first A big deep sigh is our first topic is actually really serious you guys and I want to take a moment to address this because I hope that I can be the change that you all need and the inspiration you all need and you know, maybe there wasn't though weren't those people in your life who are showing you the right way and that's become more clear to me this week. And so with that we're going to get into That March Madness rom-coms because what the actual fuck I'm sorry. I was going to dial it back and kind of intro in and be a little nicer to you all but no, I'm actually pissed we had sweet 16 this week. We were supposed to have Ali date, but I was so shocked by the sweet 16 results from all of you that I had to push Elite eight back till this coming week. I mean I don't I don't know what happened. We lost. All of the classics and a lot of you I've spoken to some of you and it was a little bit of well, it's not technically a rom-com or it's not all happy and I just know it's no it's not I don't need Insight from you because a lot of people are also throwing shade at you. I haven't brought this up to you, but people believe that Sleepless You've got mail or because of you no, no, no stop. I will just say No, no, no, no, no, no, no. No the hooker made the elite eight. I need you. Also stop call like Julia Roberts in Pretty Woman the hooker because she is more than that, and it's rude. First of all, I'm gonna start till yeah. So Meg Ryan didn't make the elite eight and how many movies three movies Crash and Burn that's so not true and like as someone who hates Teddy Mellencamp who will be her stepdaughter at some point soon. Like you would think I'd turn on Meg. I will never turn on Meg because Meg Ryan is rom-coms Right rom coms are my grind and Tom Hanks, but specifically Meg Ryan. No, I need you to stop. This is about me now and Your Insight is so unnecessary and not even intuitive because let's talk real quick. What movie did you tell me? You hadn't seen today? Oh My Best Friend's Wedding, which also lost has not seen it you guys I need to it's not even what sweets not even an Elite 8 movie. Why would I say it's garbage? Let me tell you something you guys this March Madness to me now not real like Bible e whatever movie with the only way this becomes okay pretty woman with winds may be Love Actually, but what else we've got left. If you all let one of these other ones win, I generally agree with the elite eight. Like stop your dad just doing this to poke the bear. You could look at my bracket. I think I'm pretty accurate with the elite eight is go you because there's no overrated my grind it. Oh my God, you guys first of all, that's not true. Because you know, and you have said When Harry Met Sally that was the one seed overall that was the number one overall one seed yeah and it is because rom coms are based off that movie. I'm sorry. No. Yeah, but I think I like that movie because when we went to go see it in the theater, they let us bring a pizza in with us. And so I was influenced by the cheese. Okay. I think you're just now trying to stir stir shit up. I can tell by your smart. Yeah, so let me just say When Harry Met Sally. It's a goddamn classic like Billy Crystal Meg Ryan. Their whole story is the Journey of a romance. That wasn't meant to be a romance. They were friends first. They hated each other first. I'm sorry, then they became friends. It's a full Arc. A lot of the final movies are not a full Arc and not deep enough as deep as When Harry Met Sally. Also a lot of you were like my best friend's wedding. It's really not a rom-com. Yeah it is. Sorry that Julia Roberts is the one to win the man in the end because Cameron Diaz was a nicer person. And remember we're only fell for Cameron. He belonged with Cameron, but you know we did get A sing-along which I told you last week and I'm not going to hit the note this week just because I'm so emotional but I'm gonna go for it forever and ever you'll stay in my heart. I actually might have killed it. I'm not sure stop shaking your head. It wasn't as good as last week's but I might go into her that being said, like I said, oh my God and you've got mail bouquets of sharpened pencils. Look do Tom and Meg probably need therapy after you've got mail because he obviously lied to her and there was I'm like background there with NY 1 5 2 and shopgirl and AOL and the whole thing. They met in a chat room. Like it was probably before chat rooms were super sexual and then that caviar is a garnish Happy Thanksgiving Happy Thanksgiving back. There are so many moments in that because also Nora Ephron you don't know who Nora Ephron is. I'm just done. They're just done with this whole thing and it makes me very upset. So obviously I had to put a pause on it. So what were going into this week is just our real caliber of nonsense. We have she's all that that's probably the most iconic like mm shit on she's all that two days ago, and I said I was in high school and it was out. I saw it like a million times. I don't ever have to see it again. She's all that she literally took her glasses off and they cut her. And that was her makeover like it is that's that that's that's the plot hole in all of these epic rom-coms. Absolutely one that Princess Diaries. She had like some shitty hair. No. Yeah. I stand on that pothole Freddie Prinze jr. Like she was already hot. She just wore overalls and he's like, let's put her in a sexy little dress. I don't sense that. That is that that is in the elite eight. Yes, you have to agree that that's nonsense that beat out Crazy Stupid Love by 15 points. When was She's All That? I'm out in the early 2000s know 90s. Was it 90s? Yeah, I would say that it was a top of its time. So, why would it not be elite eight? If it's one of the best all the other movies that it went up against all the other movies I went up against I love She's All That I'll go watch it right now and enjoy it thoroughly. It is not an Elite 8 and that is my problem with see. Did you give it? It's an eight. Conduit a couple years ago. They were an eight seed and then when the whole goddamn thing if this one so cutter thing, I regret everything I've done here and it's got but it's not going to because guess what it's up against. Philadelphia Story, no, you know that loss of the first round. You're just poking me down puts it up against clueless. Oh, that's a good one. Even though clueless isn't even a rom-com. So I think she's all that wind. That's it's up against clueless. I think that it wins because clueless is not an actual rom-com. I don't even know if the Romantic lot storyline and clue is more than ten minutes of the movie. It's illegal. Also, can we just talk about or is there some questionable she is 16. She is 16 and he is in college look guys. That's her stepbrother. He's in college you thought I got pissed off at Never Been Kissed. Yeah, that's true. This is shady shit going on. I'm sure Sheriff Cher Horowitz and Josh. He doesn't even have a last name. It's just Josh. I think he is in a KU basketball hat or just a KU hat, but honestly, there's a lot to question about that movie and sure it's a classic as well. I'm not surprised clueless made it. I'm just upset that. It's going to get a really easy Road and I think it's a sketchy movie. And he's all that advances your you're really wrong on this. This is a landslide could go the rest of these are landslides except for one geniality Miss Congeniality also made it. Well, that's one of the classic rom-com. No, it's not. No, you know that it's not and you even weren't even sure it should be in here because the romance in that with the FBI agent is minimal. So it's constant banter its back and forth to sexual tension builds for a full hour and a half before they We got it on. No. Absolutely. This is not a rom-com. Absolutely. This is that it's very bare minimum of a rom-com. It's too good their veteran neither of which have an illegal profession either which pay for each other's company. You just know that you just know it's going to get it's going up against pretty well. Oh shit. What do you know about that? Good talk about your hooker. I have nothing bad to say about Pretty Woman. It's a classic and you know what? This is the problem. We can't start going into like obviously pretty woman has its issues looking back now, but if we start to dissect it, it's a terrible movie. No, it's not terrible movie. There's some questionable moments, but like honestly at least she's of age at yourself on the back for that. Wretch I don't I don't care. I know I just think pretty woman. She fell on Hard Times. She found the guy who loved her for her and she called his money. No, she only got $3,500. They negotiated. I just want your extra time and your Kiss and $3,500. Yeah, and she got that but then he and some outfits and then he came back for. Not with the Opera Coming Out musical. Yeah, it actually has some musical moments. She goes she goes to the Opera it was all right. I almost believe it's beating Miss Congeniality. Come on. All right. This one is honest to God Love Actually 100% should still be here. I'm fine with love actually still being the lead eight. It's a lot. It's a different movie. It's a different kind of style and another musical number. And Hugh Grant dancing, which I enjoyed so I'm going to let this one slide and who doesn't love all I want for Christmas. The holiday no, no, well, it's going up against that but I'm saying they sing All I want for Christmas is you that was actually not that either. I mean it was no Mariah, but well, I didn't say I was trying to be variety. I'm gonna be well, we're gonna name our child Mariah right? It's going up against the holiday, which you guys I think some of you are really confused here and I think maybe the holiday is obvious obvious movie in this whole thing that it's just like really this is what is this is what you consider to be the Elite 8 the holiday, it's clever. It's cute. Whatever Jack Black I enjoy his character. I could look at Jewel all day long. Did you say it's the most borrowed movie? Yeah, it literally got I knew it was going to ruin I should have never put it in the brackets actually know if this is what beat When Harry Met Sally which is maybe more upsetting than people like it why you mad that people like it because they're wrong. Okay, you know like and I think you all we just need to have a moment and I I knew that I should have forced family fun some of these movies leading up to my Rom-com March Madness, but I didn't want to people off to what I was doing. So I was like, okay, I'm not going to start promoting these movies and talk about why they're so great and I should have I should have led you all in the right direction. And that's on me. That's on me. Is this movie shouldn't have beat When Harry Met Sally Never never ever ever ever. So I'm just upset about it. I'm just it's whatever like obviously Cameron Diaz can cry. Like what is that story line? I haven't cried and ten years. It's like suddenly she's crying in the cab and she's a really bad crier. It just comes to her like that like how dumb I don't know you speak very passionately about it. Sounds like it's a good movie again. You haven't seen it. So no so and then our final seating which actually worked out kind of funny How to Lose a Guy in ten days and ten things. About you the rule 10, uh-huh, you know, I don't know if I care which either one makes it here. How to Lose a Guy in ten days. I wasn't surprised made it this far just because it's always on E and it just seems to be like a wrong Comcast Cana. Hey in Kate sure. I vote for McConaughey on this one. Yeah, I mean 10 Things I Hate About You is a I wouldn't be upset with either one just because I I hope that it would lose to Love Actually in the final four and that it's going to be clueless and pretty woman in the final four and God only knows what you all have to I honestly I have a feeling coulis is winning this whole thing. I don't think clueless makes it to the final four. I think you're so wrong that you think she's all that is. What wins here. Okay, let's see. All right. So up next is bills favorite subject. You were the one who actually encouraged us to record after tonight's premiere of Keeping Up with the Kardashians and I will say for someone who is having a real hard time committing to Game of Thrones really can't tune in. To New York or Beverly Hills tonight. He says you know what? I guess I won't go play my video game so I can kind of know what's going on. When the podcast happens. I was like Kardashians. This is this is where you're going to join in. Yeah, so that's Kings clay why two glasses and you can stand vaguely paying attention to the Kardashians. Well, here's the thing just to back it up for what you're saying because that's not really a fair representation of it. All King. Game of Thrones is 55 hours. I just I well that's how much we have left. I can't commit to 55 hours of Television, but I can read in 15 minutes on Wikipedia. It's just it doesn't make sense to me and I don't know all the information the bed. We housewive Hills and the New Yorkers. Do you do enough recap on your story that when I'm in the other room playing my video games. I can just watch like five total minutes of your story, you know, everything that's happening and those shows so I'm well-versed in all of that Kardashian's I could not care less about anyone in this family to the point where if no one ever said the name Kardashian again, I wouldn't even know that it was a name in the first place. Like I wouldn't even miss hearing that name. So that been said, I'm so disinterested in In it kind of like how you were with this last season the bachelor that I have to be around it. If you want me to have any sort of been put on I know but you didn't you you said you didn't care much and it ended up being something you really enjoyed that not so you're gonna ask you what but I would not watch her story about the Kardashians. I don't read when you were reviewing the Jordan shit. I think I ignored you for two weeks on social media. That's not true. And and new know because the Jordan thing happened I was almost The 20,000 and I was just looking through all that stuff again kind of reliving the moment. They're just the worst now. We're going to review this without you going down a deep dark hole of Despair. Like I need you to either decide if you're going to be quiet or if you're going to engage my commentary without your only comment being the worst. I don't know if I can guarantee either of those things until I hear said commentary. All right. Well, first of all a lot of the people who Recently follow me joined in when the Jordan would Saga began earlier mid-February. And obviously we know going into this season or we knew going into this season that that timing is a little off and we're not going to get Jordan Kylie Tristan Chloe drama that being said the trailer that came out this week before the premiere tonight was all about Kylie Jordan Tristan. Who's the other one Chloe drama, and I know that we're only going to get that in the last five minutes of the finale really? It's all gonna just be that's going to be the actual moment, but I'm here for it. I'm glad they're back. Like it's a Sunday night thing for me. I don't need much from them. I enjoy just getting a little pieces of them. But Larsa was on tonight, of course luckily. They didn't do a cameo or interview or whatever. Her but she's thirsty sucking the life out of everything Malik is a little all over the place closed or Courtney's just depressed. Khloe is still in a relationship with Tristan. And then honestly, the whole episode was really about Kanye which was new for a new fan like yourself and me. Well, it makes sense. Think about it going into the season. They had absolutely nothing you elf said this season is going to be abysmal. They have nothing going on camera. No, you said they had nothing to talk about you said that they had nothing going for them. And so they said all right. Look Kanye like we gotta get you on because we have nothing to talk about and you're kind of an untapped resource. So do you mind like putting some of your story in Cotton? He's like, yeah, I get paid off this so let's do it. That's not what I think happened here. Okay, that's fine. We'll get to yours in a second and then this Jordan And Tristan thing all went down and they're like, okay we can edit this in and make all this happen. So now they're going to start with all the Kanye stuff that they originally thought slowly. You're going to see a lot more footage of Jordan probably by episode three or four she's going to start getting a lot more face time. So everyone resonates with her and gets to know more about her character until boom. They're going to come up Swinging with the finale or the last couple episodes which will be fun because right when shit gets good with Kardashian and they're all sleeping around Game of Thrones. Thrones is it going to be getting ready to end their run and they're going to come on arrival times and it will be very fun to see which one is like leading the Twitter war Game of Thrones and I know but just for all the people out there like you that are big into this Jordan Woods thing. Hello. I won't care like okay never mind. I thought you're going to have a different reaction to 100% know like people are going to die on Game of Thrones like like the world is ending as we know it on Game of Thrones like who's more fake the characters and Game of Thrones or the people on But the Kardashians that's probably a fair question. I don't know if it's a fair question. Very fair question. I mean We don't know what world Game of Thrones is in bright. We can't call them fake or not. The Kardashians are more fake. No, then the characters on Game of Thrones. No, obviously those are real people live in Calabasas. I yes, obviously those are real people. Am I invested more? So in Jon Snow and Khaleesi and like they're in sexual relationship, of course. Like right now. Yeah, the drama of the Kardashians is real in two weeks. I will tune in to the Kardashians not probably on Monday nights when I get home. Maybe I'll watch on the treadmill Monday mornings on my fitness journey, but I will be watching her - or Game of Thrones live. Hmm and then we will be going into recording an episode about Game of Thrones. So yeah Kardashians falls to the Wayside for Six weeks solid. Yeah, but the only times I've heard all day. Yeah, that's why you have to start watching Game of Thrones. I already know what happens. I read it. I read the books. Oh, no, you didn't read a book. I heard the Wikipedia's. Yeah. So anyway, so this week's episode interesting. I'm not disagreeing with your theory that they are going to re-edit and rework because they probably cut some Jordan things and some Tristan things and they're definitely both in scenes, but they're going to Pepper them back in so it feels a little more like boom shit. Look what happened is I do think last season of the Kardashians. The big criticism was everyone knew what was going on with the Kardashians because they posted all in their social media. Everything was already out there. Even the little things even business things or whatever. I do think they try for more of a privacy route. They deleted all their Before this season not that I don't know anyone who had their apps, but I think this stuff is the public stuff but it's the behind-the-scenes reaction to Chloe finding out this story or Kylie finding out her best friend of ten years is shitty person. I think that's the stuff. They kept hidden. Well this season that it might not even be in the season but will be in second season and or next season season 17, but that will get a little more Taste of Does any part of you think they might have fabricated the whole Jordan Tristan saga? No, you don't think that they it's a they puppeteered this whole thing. No, I thought that during it at some points. But at this point with Jada Pinkett-Smith unfollowing them all this week. I think Jordan is being very oh and then there was a you've got no male this Instagram account. He just moved to London part-time and he has been following this a lot and he ran into Jordan because Runs in London and she just said, you know, it was a very vague conversation, but you can go to his Instagram and he posted just the text that he sent to a friend being like Oh my God. This is what she said and stuff. But I mean, I think I think Jordan was living in Kylie Shadow. I think some guy some shitty guy. Tristan is the worst also in news this week. Tristan is dming some 17 year old. She's look 17 but he sliding into her DM's. Tristan is the worst like the worst. I mean, we have Kris Humphries to reference. We have dark days of Scott. We have a lot of shitty guys at these people have different Montana. I mean not that French was the worst. He didn't even matter, but I'm just saying like Tristan is scum. He's some 27 year old basketball player who just does not believe the rules would apply to him. I mean he Literally went with a stripper and hooker random girl in the bar. I don't know when Chloe was due in three days. Oh, maybe he bought her clothes and they fell in love. Yeah. No, no, no leave pretty woman alone. Now, we took the I mean like a Khloe kind of got this guy not in a questionable. I don't know if it was a questionable way, but he left his pregnant girlfriend for Khloe and then he cheated on Khloe and she was literally almost put her into labor. It's shitty guys and we all can't keep thinking we can change guys and people need to stop thinking they can change Tristan Thompson because Jordan Woods, you know, she sat on the armchair of his chair and her legs touched his and nothing happened, but then she kissed him goodbye, but I don't even want to get into that the friendly tongue kiss right now. There was no tongue. That was the one specification but you know, he's also like 7 foot tall and she's five foot like it gives you a few minutes to think maybe they shouldn't have Still maybe they shouldn't happen to him. He still hasn't reached me yet. Maybe I should pull away like she had a little while to think know so I think Jordan shady, I think Tristan shady. I think we had to Shady people not in maybe Jordans not shady. I think Jordan is tired of living in a shadow and think she can do it on her own and she can't and she ruined a billion-dollar friendship that a lot of us would appreciate. You know, I'm excited to see how they line up this season. I always know the show is pretty Castrated but it is their lives. Also. I don't think Khloe Kardashian wants her baby. Daddy cheating on her when she's got a one-year-old at home. No, I don't think that part was orchestrated some of these storylines. Sure Kim and Kourtney haired she want to put it on TV. You don't have a choice at this point contract wise, this is your and that's what she says and this I mean you you do this so much your contract is I mean, you can go lock yourself in the bathroom. They could probably just by the E network. And then edit it out if I wanted to sure they only Network at this that's what I'm saying is their contract is contracted to themselves. They're just Marxist. It's Ryan Seacrest will hold them to it. Ryan Seacrest is always making money. Hi guys. I'm back and I'm back on with anchor.

Well, so they have more going on than just Keeping Up with the Kardashians tomorrow or Monday the or maybe it's the It's April 1st or April 2nd Courtney's random, whatever. I don't know poosh poosh the lifestyle. That's a Kardashian thing. I know you've been talking. Yes, it's Courtney's so and I'm not going to remember who messaged me this I'm so sorry. I'll tag you when I figure out the tax, but someone messaged me and I posted on the my story last week. Going through tag pictures of poosh for an account that only just started and I wondered how I was already following it when it started. They took - the old they had a clothing store - they took the old - account because - is closed and they change it to poosh. And so all these pictures are tagged really far back for something like five years ago. So someone was smart enough Kris Jenner to take the old - Instagram because Courtney would never Garner. Many followers otherwise because it's a stupid. I don't even know what it is. I think it supposed to be goop. I think it's supposed to be like Gwyneth Paltrow's goop. You know what that is. Yeah, didn't they have a TV show about that - this is how I mean, I went belly up. I think they Dash dolls for a little bit too. But then they have like a brick and mortar in Miami know they had stores and they might have had a little yeah, they had - I don't know that company folded. Yeah - is done. So then Courtney took the Instagram handle. And has made push which it just sounds like douche or PooPourri but a different name for PooPourri like and the image like Pooch like a little belly. Yeah, push like and it says push the boundaries like push your pants. Yeah, it sure sounds like it just and all the images like there was one with like oranges on the ground. It was two feet standing over the laundress. It's like did she push those oranges out of her but like it just is I don't understand it. I'm not totally curious about it. But like tomorrow it sounds like it could be a good like clothing line for toddlers or like newborn. Well, it says it's lifestyle and Penelope her daughter. That's her nickname push. Okay, like Scott calls are Pooch. So that's where it comes from but it's not really good lifestyle. Like if it's a beauty product like you just think of like a like dirty. I don't know push just feels like a weird like cleaning. Yeah moment something that they would use to describe refresh products. Yeah. Yeah. Like I said PooPourri, so not sure oh but the next quick Kardashian thing before we move on. We'd love to hear what you have last week. You said you would come back to us with some church of Kanye research true. I did I I talked to my sources. I did some internet Googling and research now my initial feedback on the situation was I thought that they were doing practicing for like a cat or something. I thought that he was kind of doing going to announce a world tour something. This was going to be part of it. You're about to butcher this but am I like but then it came to light he announced on an airplane over PA system that he would actually playing coach. Oh this year. So it seems like he's gonna be taking this church of Kanye concept to Coachella, which I didn't know this but he was supposed to be headlining Coachella, but he demanded having a domed stage in the middle of the crowd and they wanted to comply with it. So they removed him from Coachella, but now they are going to take the Church of Kanye Sunday. What's it called Sunday sessions first, it's Easter. No, I know but the hashtag. Sunset scare doing now, but they're only playing the second weekend, which is happens to be Easter Sunday. So he's taking his little gospel really kind of cool looking thing. They got going on and playing Coachella with it. My next question would be who is your Source on all this fight. Never reveal my sources drop me to read over your sword. No because you don't even know my sources. No, you told me earlier who your Source was, it's me, so that surprised look on. Your face when I Just Dropped a Bomb about him announcing on a plane that you told me that I'm the one who posted it earlier today and I said look kindly on a plane and his hair was different that no and then you go. Yeah, you're my source on all this like you literally said I have other sources you just confirm them. No. No, I'm your Source or and I know you weren't watching Kardashian stories today. Nope, so I have other sources. No. Me you told me I was the source sure. He's going to try and twist this guy's but he I am his Source. I'm still proud that you sold that like you did some research this week. I brought it up to you today. Just being like hey, remember you promised everyone that you're going to come back with some stuff. And you said yeah what's going on with that and I explained it to you stupidly and then you just took all my words and put them out as Your story just then not really sure what you're getting out of calling me out on this one, but we can I don't know I enjoy with that. I enjoyed it. Honestly. I just wanted to make sure people knew the truth. Next time I give you an assignment. I hope you can do it on your own rather than forget. I'll just go back through your news feed and start tagging some truths in there. Oh everyone get ready Phyllis tagging truth in my newsfeed. Whatever the hell that means. I'm excited. I'm excited to see what truths you're spilling. Let's go. All right, we'll move off the Kardashians just because I can tell you've done your research this week and your little done. And we'll move on to some TV shows this week. So we actually haven't talked about this at all. And we should because this is the one show you do watch and you do enjoy chopped. No talk about cha. We watched a great Thanksgiving episode this week that's still on our DVR. We forgot that one no Vanderpump Rules. So we're going to get into Vanderpump Rules which Bill actually watches. It's the only show you really do watch from Bravo consistently we moved in together. How long ago I don't know why I just looked at the clock so few minutes ago. We just moved into this place. Uh-huh. But when the first or when that last season it was Jax and Faith all that drama. It was the first episode of that and Bill kind of walks in the living room and walked out and kept being like, what is this little curious? And then sat down it was hooked. Maybe we've decided it's probably because we've worked in the industry and and everyone we know in the industry loves this show like things it's hilarious all these drunk messes of humans and Jax is obviously just a treat but this season has been okay nothing too crazy, but this week I found it very enjoyable. Which prior well We thought it was enjoyable a they're going on a trip again because you know, no one they all pretend like they work at this restaurant. But for how many employees are leaving on a given basis this place would be crumbling but our big thing and I went on a rant this week about it was the Katie and Tom fight and you had some insight into that and were annoyed with it because in a in a way we've lived in this like you were managing a bar working how many hours crazy schedule and he is part owner God only knows how much and this restaurant and Katie is you know, missing some attention. He's obviously a lot busier because God only knows what Tom Schwartz did with his free time before I'm not sure how much he and Sandoval are doing right now. I think Katie goes into work. Once a week just for filming purposes. So this might be a little bit of an orchestrated storyline that they don't have a lot of time together, whatever but this fight felt pretty I don't think it is orchestrated. I think they both seem very unreasonable. I think he's a mess to begin with but I know I didn't watch the old episodes. So I don't know when Katie was what from what I understand a monster but rage rage text. Yeah. She's showing a couple of times this season that her true colors last season. She was pretty nice and seemed like she was on the comeback Trail making amends with people and she just me seemed cool. You know this season. She kind of seemed I'm seeing that kind of bitchy psychopath that you say she used to be in the previous well because she had it out with James which I get that James was way out of line, but you know, she made such a point gave Lisa an ultimatum then she had it out with Sandoval and Sandoval. Sandoval had some really good points because Katie kind of acted terrible and then Sandoval's like you can totally be a bitch to everyone and say whatever you want anyone but one person says something to you and you try to ruin his life like they're you know, there's to add two sides that sword Katie, you know, now you just kind of get in karma coming back to you and now she's getting mad at her husband because dudes working his ass off opening a restaurant. She's begging him for attention during that so immediately, you know, it's an uphill battle. She's fighting she should know it's not build battle. It's not fair because I'm sure that He would and I can tell you right now because I did it for a long time a hundred percent would rather be spending time with her then at work working his ass off dealing with a lot of nonsensical bullshit. Well, and I just think a we don't know really like Different schedule and who knows how much he was really working and stuff, but it did come off that I mean when they did start this fight this fight escalated because she was rage texting him when he and scheana got upgraded to First Class. Yeah, which was the amazing part. And of course, it's scheana Tom there's shorts and she was like switch seats with me and he goes no and then you could tell by how the camera was panning back between his phone her him asleep her. She was the drinking. She was getting drunk and sending him angry texts the whole time. So then they get to the hotel you stand on that. No, I've never flown first class. I don't believe you have either have you. No, I feel private. Oh, I don't know you've been on a PJ once but PJ, I'm stassi. So one time it was an accident if I had gotten upgraded to first class and I was like, I wouldn't be shocked if I would say switch with me. If you didn't I wouldn't be like, yeah pretend to already be asleep right guy. I would I would suggest it and see if like, all right, maybe without you had a list of an argument on the way to a vague there was obviously issues and like you said shorts I can't imagine dating Schwartz first like he's a very to married to like we have to give Katie a little credit here because he's kind of a mess. I just think it was the Catalyst for this whole thing and there was a lot of other underlying things but they get back to the room. There's like a full blown out fight like and he says some stuff that yeah makes it not so he doesn't sound like he wants to hang out with her. It doesn't sound like he wants to be around her not there now and she's acting like that, but also just like I don't have time. For you, I don't like the sound of your voice. Like I don't like the sound of her voice either, but I'm not married to her. Yeah, like if you said that to me, I'd be like but also what's a lot of the offseason they don't show like maybe he works 12 hours at the bar and then comes home and she's giving him a hard time for waking her up. The two babies coming home late, and she's giving him a hard time. All of them and make them a face of this and it continues her Legacy in a clever way. I I question how much they're involved and I think a lot of Schwartz's maybe working for his part ownership. All right, Sam just doing at the bar. I think he's just you know, and I'd be annoyed to be doing a promotion tour let people know what's in there. Yeah, he's just going, you know, all three bars are next to each other and I think that is frustrating on Katie's part, but I think she just Looked like Katie just gets in a drunk stage where she's shouting shouting shouting and he is just like you said your voice. Yeah, but he said you have the EQ of a fourteen-year-old the IQ. He's an EQ. Alright it is he cute but people were messaging me saying I think that stands for emotional intelligence and it doesn't somebody else told me he might have thought it does but someone else who was a psychology something. I don't remember. Said it's not EQ. It's like ET or weird something not with it. You would think but that's probably what he meant. She's the emotional intelligence of a 14 year old their relationship is just a mess and then they filmed that also happened this week. The reunions was getting filmed so we know the reunions being filmed right now. We kind of saw the seating arrangement its boughs first from reunions Lisa was there looking fabulous and the only drama we've gotten is Jax has tweeted a bunch saying it was the most insane reunions. They've ever had like biggest fights biggest drama everything and then Kristen Instagram storied something really vague about like don't break my wings or I don't even know so sounds like she was under the attack which I'm surprised because I mean Carter is the problem there. So I wonder I don't know how to get her off the show. I hope that this is her swans. I mean she's a fun mess, but she brings nothing to the table. Just the thing is we're all deeply attached to Kristen right again. I'm not because of what I mean Kristen Kristen's connection to all of this like Christian was with Sandoval then Christian slept with Jax Kristen. You keep saying Christian. Oh, sorry Kristen. I think I said Kristen Kristen slept with Jax who was dating stassi her best friend and then Kristen laughs or to cheat on Sandoval with Jane's. Then she brings that's how James gets into the group. I mean and then James she hates James as passionate about James. It's all a beautiful mess and so much of it stems from Kristin. I mean, she knows the real Catalyst of this entire show like we wouldn't be here without scheana but really, yeah, that's how Beverly Hills started Real Housewives of Beverly Hills. This was how they like intro to you in Brandi was this housewife and that who was her husband who is now married to Not Jule, who's the singer? That's blonde like Jewels LeAnn Rimes. Goddamnit. Yahoo! Your drives. Are you got there? I'm so proud of you. So Brandy was married to Eddie Cibrian Eddie cheated on Brandy with a Hostess or a server at Vanderpump and I happen to be Sheena it was scheana so they segmented literally the episode didn't even stop a real housewife of Beverly Hills and it went into this thing and everyone was like what's going on? Where are we there was no commercial anything and that it was Long episode they went into Vanderpump Rules and it was through Sheena and everything and because Lisa was a housewife and intro in it in and that's how we got to Vanderpump Rules. So Vanderpump Rules already show and they know the story line about scheana. No, there was no no there was no show yet Bill no through a question. So at some point this season, they're going to segue into Vanderpump dogs for this whole fucking dog scenario that they've been building up and suddenly you're just going to be watching Vanderpump college and not realize it because cuz to repot a fucking dog or to know what but we're to know I know they're going to segment into Vanderpump dogs. I mean that's happening. I don't even care again fabricated story. Like this have fabricated no streets definitely terrible human and got this dog and listen idiot about it. He did what he told her to do it a promote their shows no way and he doesn't mess with them. No, he doesn't need to this drama all happens. Then he just fires people. He doesn't want to be too close to a mall and tell him what you do but this weekend they Did have Vanderpump Vegas open at Caesar's Palace and supposedly there were cameras there and all the cast was all there all the Tom's all the Jacks for there were cameras. They had Mike's on so fingers crossed. We are getting a Vanderpump Vegas. Like I know I think the an episode though. I want to show but we don't even know the character. That's fine. We got a new show. Yes, you can. Don't doubt yourself like that. They don't know Vegas. Are you kidding? Yeah, and probably I was thinking all the Lohan Beach people who like God off Lohan beach and came back because so many of them were working in Vegas. Lisa would do well to tap into a few of those to come over for her scheana's got a show in Vegas about her sex life or something and she could go she is which Lisa says she's her best employee sure. She did so I don't know. I'm pumped for Vanderpump Vegas, whatever. Happens there. Mmm-hmm. So Bleeding from Vanderpump Rules. Obviously we can kind of segmented right into it Real Housewives of Beverly Hills not too much this week. I mean, we obviously only mentioned the dog 200 times which is a lot less than most weeks. Now, the big story of this week was actually Denise Richards getting married and it was everything Denise Richards is so I don't give a fuck that it does not belong. Beverly Hills but it's making Beverly Hills bearable right now her whole style like she literally her daughter comes down to cannot walk in her high heels her six-year-old daughter and she's like Mom. Can I just go put tennis shoes on to go down the aisle to the wedding hall was I don't care. I'm gonna shit do what you want did he's like sure does not care. Her daughter comes out in her dress and tennis shoes and they all walk down the aisle together as a family to get married. I mean and she walks down the ire fire. That what was the wine again? They walk down the aisle to like some heavy metal song. I mean it comes on everyone's like all right, Denise Richards like you do you she just she just like yeah, I had a great time. This is fun. Let's do it again sometime Lisa Rinna made a good point. There were camera Crews or helicopters and Paparazzi and everything everywhere and people are like how annoying like how rude that the paparazzi's To get shots Lisa Rinna goes, you know, you know, you're still doing okay, if you live here and somebody does show up to take a picture if they don't that's when you got to go poke another gig. So I'll give credit to render this week, even though she and I are on the outs with Charlie there. No, she invited him though. He was there. Yeah, no heat they have two daughters together. But yeah, she invited him. Otherwise this week was pretty I mean Lisa Vanderpump. Was friendly with everyone at the party. Teddy was talking to her during her we're totally fine. We end the episode with this article has been leaked to probably write our online again, I think and it's you know Drita has hurt Lisa by neglecting this dog and giving up this dog in the whole story was leaked and treats like pay cash. I take a oh my God. What if people think I'm A dog abuser and it's like a nobody nobody reads radar. We only read radar because of the what voice were you just do that's dorit's pecan pie goodness. No, I don't know but I know she has like 27 different acts. That wasn't what you were trying to do Lisa Vanderpump, and I wasn't sure because I was joking tag me this that's what yeah. Okay, PK. Okay. That's how she does it. Okay. I mean, I'm going to listen back to this. It's not going to be exactly what I thought I heard. Heard and wait to hear it. Uh-huh. But yeah, so she talks but she's really upset and he PK obviously, it's like definitely Lisa leaked this and guess what? I don't think she did and radar has said it wasn't Lisa who leaked it. I wouldn't be surprised if one of the other ones leave did the try to make a story like Lisa Rinna I just ran on might have done it to sabotage Lisa Vanderpump. I didn't well I read this. I also read Just a few minutes ago because I was trying to recap in my mind what had happened and somebody tweeted that or something Kyle responded that being like that might be the craziest rumor. I've heard that Rena leaked it to make the storyline about Lisa and you guys my whole Theory at this point now is because I've been very much. I I stand Lisa those who are award I support Lisa Vanderpump still I'm still just I don't know. I don't I just think. While yes, there's some parts of her story that I'm a little mmm on and she has done some stuff like this before no one else is story is matching up enough for me to go. Oh shit. No one's I mean Teddy has changed her story a thousand times Dury. Honestly, no one should even tell anybody about the second dog for half of the I mean, it just doesn't make sense. Yes. They have Lisa Vanderpump. Boggs is a thing that's going to happen. I don't know if it was going to before and then we had New York this week. Which nothing crazy there. Dorinda's is well, you know Barbara should have an apple by now. We don't know why Barbara the tool woman doesn't have an apple. She is in every scene at this point. They've called out during de and Luann have met up. They went to lunch with Bethenny and Barbara karynda does not think she heckled the Giovanni show Luann is on her high horse and is going to kind of draw. Like this whole thing out and then Durand adjust goes on a rampage against Barbara and the end of the episode be like get out of my house. Get out of my house bitch Barbers trying to talk to her about Louis and and being like, you know, she's hurt. You're hurt. No, that's why I think to do with it. There's not much there. I mean, they're probably just giving Barbara trial run to see if she's going to be interesting enough to give her an Apple for next season's probably a tryout for her. Well, they have before like midseason put them in camps. NEOS and giving them stuff. So I'm wondering if that's what's going to happen. I don't just like Barbara. I think Barbara's doing what Denise is doing in Beverly Hills. It's just enough of a difference that she stands out in a good way. But I don't know. I think people are people are divided on if New York's good right now if it's kind of boring, I'm into New York just because we like you said last week. It's not the same storyline each episode. Bethenny has her own shit right now. Tim's more Ramona and Sonja you need the I think that they need that those two are just like they're just well Ramona is like hugging Bethany when she sees her and be like, I want to say, I'm sorry for your loss. It's like Ramona, you're going to have a real tough reunions after the shit you said last week and now this week being like I feel so bad for her. It's like bitch. You are the worst. I don't need any more Ramona - yeah. Yeah. Oh, I always need more Sonja though. Sonja's rocking this bump it right now. It's like a hair piece that goes make your care in here bigger. Yeah, so but she's like she's got extensions and she's really into them and it you know, it's kind of like seeing dorit's hair in the same style for too long leader eat are so extreme son. Just had this now for like five episodes and she still got it like in right now like, Her Instagram. She's posting things with this long long long down to her butt hair in this one big bump it I mean, it's literally Amy Winehouse style beehive happening here. There's probably more to Real Housewives of New York that I'm forgetting. But I think it's going to get better. I think it only gets more dramatic with all of them. So I think New York is going to pick up. I think it's a little not slow right now. I just oh that was the other thing Sonia just out of nowhere at the beginning of this episode, which we knew was coming at her party just starts. I've know where this woman comes out. It's like so yeah waves tour and then they just start making out. Yeah, just out of nowhere to sleep at that one. I know I don't know how I forgot that. It was out of nowhere. It was so funny because every I mean Bethany ever was like someone just waves to her out of nowhere. They start making up making out the woman just walks off. I mean there was no there was no hello conversation nothing. So can I come kiss you so undergoes sure walks out quick it was but that's what Sonia gives and that's what New York like, I don't know. I think New York right now just has enough humor. Beverly Hills feels very heavy - Denise. So to be continued on both of those. I think we're only I mean Beverly Hills next week is headed into a shit storm with Kyle and Lisa. That's the big glove fight. They intro the season with and then New York. I think we're headed into, you know during a seems a little lost right now and obsessed with the whole Luann thing, but I think Luann's gonna her ego is getting Bigger and bigger and bigger and Bethenny's about to do the whole life is not a cabaret it salt so that's what we're working towards and then the only other thing Bravo we have coming this week. We heard Southern Charm is delayed and because of the Thomas Ravenel drama and then the next day we got the Southern Charm trailer. It looks delicious. I love Southern Charm Ashley makes a quick appearance. I don't think it's much from what I had heard on the blogs and everything Travis nothing. Thank goodness Shep looks like he's going to be an asshole but I just love Shep. So I just don't really care. Naomi's new hot boyfriend in the trailer makes an appearance and then there is a comment that Kathryn and Whitney were hooking up during the summer, you know, nothing about southern. I'm interested in this whole Catherine Whitney situation. Whitney is a guy. I'm sorry, I mean moving right along. Well, that's all I had. I guess we'll end on that. Yeah, so it should be a good week. We're gonna head into the elite eight and the final four. We're going to head in the final four in March Madness actual March Madness to which let me just tell you the joy it brings me. That duke-north Carolina and Kentucky roll out. Someone message me. They're like, please talk about it on your podcast. So that's my pick my quick. Statement about that. I'm thrilled. I'm cheering for Auburn and Texas Tech if they play each other. I feel like I'd lean Big 12 just out of allegiance to the Big 12, but also Kansas loss to Auburn so wouldn't it be nice to just say we lost the best team in the country and not feel so bad the flip side to that is if Texas Tech or Michigan State wins it they play each other then Kansas can say they beat the eventual champion at during the regular season. So you beat Michigan State at the Champions classic and you beat Texas Tech. So really three out of four of these teams, you have a right to be cool with I really don't want Virginia to win their the only one that can't win. Yeah. Only one. Everything is ruined for genuine everything the whole. Yeah. You're right Elsie's whole. She's in my sister over. Yeah. I'm you know, I'm ready to move on to golf. I'm not ready for baseball or stuff, but I'm ready to move on to Spring Sports, you know next week. We'll have right before will have National Championship to talk about on both sides will have some more TV to talk about and anything else this week that you're going to research since you were assigned to the Kanye Church of Kanye drama. Anything else you want to take on this week - Game of Thrones. No, no, nothing great the farm. No. Okay. Well great. Well then. Thanks everyone for joining in you can now officially listen on Apple on Spotify on anchor and a lot of other things that I don't know but those are the big three. So we're legit now and you might have heard some commercials during this to that's how big this is becoming more excited guys. So leave a review leave some five stars or more.

Thank you for joining me this week. I'm super excited as always about this episode. Have you ever felt like that's it. I quit I give up. This is stupid. My business hates me. I don't even know why I'm doing this. If you've ever felt that way, then you definitely want to stay tuned for this weeks episode. If you haven't felt that way yet. Maybe you are new or in the business then. Maybe it's a good thing to listen to anyways, I have had the craziest week this week. It has been nuts my fiance just had surgery last week. Everything went very well. It was great. So that's good because off of work for about a month or so, so we are not driving each other crazy yet. So it's been a full week. So I'm very blessed about that. But anyways, so, yeah, just been working from home. He's been home trying to help him and make sure everything's good to go school. Starts tomorrow so school supplies orientation all that fun stuff. You know what I'm talking about? Hmm, super fun, right anyways. So today we are going to talk about nine different things that you can do when you feel like you want to quit like what the hell why am I doing this? This sucks? My business hates me all that fun stuff, right? So let's go ahead and just dive on in the first thing that I think of that That when I think of this phrase in the past seven years my business like I quit I give up I just don't want to do this anymore. Right is burnout. That's the first thing I think of because when I think about those times that I've been to that point my business where I'm just like I didn't want to do this anymore. Am I even make it an impact? Why am I doing this? I'm you know, my clients are canceling left and right blah blah blah. The first thing that I think about is burnout because let's get totally real burnout is real. And it happens and it's okay the that happens you have to expect struggle with changes and it's something that not necessarily you see a lot of other entrepreneurs kind of talk about really like freely online like hi. I'm burnout. I don't like my business today or whatever it would be but I have recently been in this situation where I'm like I quit I give up and I was telling my fiance the other day I said, I'm just Mad at my business like I'm mad at it right now. Like I don't want to look at it. I don't talk to it. I'm done with it. Right I felt like freaking given up. And the first thing that I've learned is to start to look internally on what's going on. Like why am I what's going on with my business? Why is my business not producing the things that I need it to produce for me right now and I go back to a lot of different things that I've learned and it all It's internally so it doesn't mean when you hit a burnout. It doesn't mean you got to throw in the towel. It doesn't mean something's wrong. It doesn't mean that the business doesn't work. It doesn't mean that you shouldn't be doing this. Okay, let me ruffle some feathers real quick. If you are within one year of your business and you're feeling a burn out. I could understand that. I think that you know, some women hustle their ass off some women hustle hard and potentially. Yeah, you could be in a burnout, but if you are less than 12 months into your business, And you're trying to throw in the towel or you think it's not for you or your like I've tried and it's just not working. Hush your face, hush your face girlfriend because you have not tried at all in the amount of time that it takes to build a clientele and a business. Okay. I'm sorry. If that doesn't make you happy then I am sorry, but it's the truth. I have seen women come into Industries and or start a business for themselves, and they've Tried for less than a year and they give up and guess what? It never works. I've seen women hit fail after fail after roadblock after roadblock the entire first year to in their business and they've turned around and they've made their business into a six-figure business. Okay, so you can't expect to be an overnight success. All right. So let's get back to what we were talking about. So it doesn't mean throw in the towel. And if you're recognizing a burnout in your business, that's okay. Okay, just You're not the only person that has been there. Okay, every single person every single woman has started at zero and that's the most beautiful thing about this is every person that has started their own business starts at zero. Nobody comes into this with 4,000 customers, right? So my first tip, I'm going to give you guys a nine things to talk earlier maybe to write down or think about you can actually come back to this episode. Go ahead and pause it. If you want to grab a pen and paper real quick. We're gonna talk about nine things that I have personally done. Done to help myself. Get out of this. I'm going to quit attitude, right? So number one is take a day or two. My girls know if they're feeling overwhelmed if they're feeling anxious if they are just mad at their business like if they're fighting with their business currently. The first thing I'm going to say to them is take a day take a day put your business down. Don't think about it. Don't touch it. Don't talk about it. Just take a day because you need to rebuild this goes back to our first episode you need to rebuild. Yourself, you need to fill up your own cup. So take a day. Take two days take an entire weekend. If you need to if you are feeling anxious and overwhelmed diving even more into your business when you're mad at it. It's not going to help you. So take a day or two number two. What is working? What is not so I want you to get really honest with yourself and this is really difficult for a lot of people and I want you to take a look and see what you are actually doing. Uh doing how are you how you are doing income-producing activities? So are you just scrolling on Facebook randomly posting things hoping for someone to get back with you to invest in you maybe take one of your horses or maybe by one of your products or are you actually taking the time and connecting one on one with people that are your customers or your potential customers and actually creating an engaging? With them. Which one are you doing? Are you passive or are you actually creating relationships? Getting honest with ourselves about our businesses probably the most difficult thing because we have to accept that what we're doing isn't working but not only that we have to look past that and we have to say Okay, what I'm doing isn't working now, so how can I shift my energy and instead of saying well this isn't working it's not working, but that's great because guess what now, you know, what doesn't work. So stop doing that turn your energy around shift that shit and figure out something that is going to work for you. This work for me is just creating honest wholesome relationships with my customers. So what's not working? And what is working if you haven't figured out what is working yet Reach Out get your butt out there. Try something different try something new. It can be so beneficial for you just to shift your energy from doing one thing to doing a different thing. Right? So the next thing number three is start evaluating your thoughts. How are you talking to yourself? How are you? Kind of interacting with your business. Are you mad at your business? Are you thinking like, well this shit ain't even working. I don't know why I'm doing it. Why am I even putting time into a why am I doing this? Why am I doing that if that's the energy you have? I'm just going to get blatantly honest with you guys right now. You're not going to have a great response from anyone. If you have a robot attitude, you're always negative. You don't have a clear message if you are constantly putting all of your products on. Y'all yada yada yada, whatever if you're doing all of that, you're not going to create the best wholesome relationships with your potential customers and clients that you need to have. Right? So people need to realize that you are beneficial for them. They are buying from you because you're you they're not buying your product or this or that or whatever they're buying from you because they trust you and they like you so make sure you are actually likeable, right? What kind of energy are you putting out into the universe? What kind of energy are you putting into your business and yourself as well? Take a definite look at that and really ask yourself and get super honest. If you have a negative mindset currently and what you can do to shift that another thing number four is take a look at your success so far. What have you accomplished? Have you earned a trip? Have you created, you know multiple courses online that you are super proud of have you invited somebody too. You know to listen to your podcast and all of a sudden it has over 200 plays like think about what you've accomplished so far and what you're excited about and reward yourself for that. The next one is get really fucking clear about your why why did you start this business? Why did you want to go into business for yourself? Why do you want to be here? And what sets you apart? Right? So what is it? Is it your kid? Kids is it because you hated your 9 to 5 you believed in something with your entire heart get really fucking clear about your why why did you start this? If you ever get to this point that's an awesome thing to do is just think about why you started this. Did you want the freedom? Did you need the money? Do you want the recognition? Do you want to work with other like-minded entrepreneurs like yourself? Why did you get into this business? Why did you start your own? I love this next one and it's making a clear decision. So I meet a lot of women who are half in half out with their business. It's their side hustle yata, whatever I get it. Okay, a lot of you guys probably have previously had or still have full-time jobs, and I get that and there's only so much time in a day and I get that too, but we need to talk real quick about making a clear decision. Making a clear decision. You have to dedicate yourself dedicate yourself and say yes, this is what I'm doing. This is why I'm doing it. This is where I'm going with it. And you girlfriend do not take no for an answer. Okay, if somebody tells, you know be like cool awesome move that van. Don't worry about it. Do not take know personally. Okay, you cannot take know personally move on to the next one because I guarantee you there is a thousand other women for every single know that would love. Of what you offer, they would love to have what you offer. Okay. So make a clear decision. Are you in or are you out are you going to dedicate time to fulfill your dreams and everything that you wanted when you first started this industry in this business, whatever it may be what got you excited and go back to that. Don't let that girl down. Okay, stop looking at things as problems and start saying opportunities. I love this. So again kind of When we went back, we kind of going off of one of the previous, you know tips that we had talked about is looking at things as problems and start seeing opportunities. So get your mindset, right? Okay. It's like oh this doesn't work. Then I'm Above the Law whatever you get all flustered and you get all pissed off because something didn't work and yada yada yada. I am fucking grateful that something didn't work in my business because I know damn well, I ain't going to do that again. Okay, so that's getting me closer to the things and getting me more. Clear about the things that I can do in my business just shifting my energy not even doing extra work, but it's just shifting my energy and putting the energy into something else that is going to work. Does that make sense? So everything that you have is an opportunity, I'll tell you guys some of you guys know what I do for a living and some of you don't so here's a quick little thing. I went to a party one time and there was like three women there and I'm like, oh great because normally have like 10 20 people there and this was years ago, and I'm like, okay great. Okay, maybe we're not gonna have huge sales. Whatever. Maybe I can get one of these girls to you know, join the company or maybe book a party or something like that. Right? So I always always always go and I don't care if there's 400 women there or for women there. Okay always go in and I'm like this is gonna be awesome because I can give me this many new women and this many lives I can change today in one way or another right? So I go in there's like four women there. I driven like a half an hour, right? Nobody wanted a book a party. Nobody wanted to join which okay, that's fine. I was probably about 3 to 4 years into my business at this point. I was making about three to four thousand dollars a month and it was great and I was like, yeah, this is awesome. Whatever right super high on my business. I was loving it. So by the end of the party whatever I didn't think that these girls would be Big Spenders, but by the end of the party every single person ordered almost three to four hundred dollars worth of product and I was like damn girl. Okay, so it totally shocked me I had no idea I was thinking like, oh my God, this is gonna find suck like nobody's gonna buy anything every single person there. All for those girls ended up being like a $1,600 party because she had a couple outside orders to and I was like heck to the yes, so I went into it with a good attitude. If I went into that with a bad attitude, they can pick up on my vibes. They're going to be able to tell like this girl's not excited to be here. She's just trying to rush through blah blah blah and they could pick up on that. So I kicked that party's ass and it rewarded me for it. Okay and same sort of thing. Let's flip flop that. Can go into room 20 some women in cell three hundred dollars worth of stuff. Right? So it's kind of on me. It's my job and my responsibility to show up as the best fucking version of me and literally give these people the best experience that they've ever had. Right? So the next thing I want to talk to you guys, there's two more things. So number eight is being thankful being thankful. Just at the end of the day if you guys listen to the previous episodes, you know that I love my journal my brain. Dump the end of the day right three things you're thankful for. Okay, even if it's in a note section, even if it's on your calendar and your phone, if you're you know, waiting at a red light or whatever just take the couple minutes and write down three things every single day that you're thankful for. I promise it will help change your mindset and the last but not least is ask for help. There are women if you are in multi-level marketing direct sales you network marketing if you have your own business, it does not matter. You can find someone to Mentor you who you look up to and someone who is going to be a positive impact in your life. I don't even care if they're in the same industry or not. I don't care. It doesn't matter find someone that you look up to that inspires you that really fuels your fire. Every time you see their shit online or talk to him or whatever be like God this person is fucking awesome. Let me reach out to her and just tell her what I'm struggling with or him. It doesn't matter get one-on-one and sometimes maybe these people may not know you you may not have a personal relationship with them. But I guarantee you you have a group of people who can help you whether it be in, you know online groups or maybe in your business industry or maybe someone that you have coached with or maybe you know, something like that find a mentor and ask for help. If you are not asking for help and you are a little bit unaware on what to do how to take the next step ask for help. I am always here. I don't know how many women die. We intend this is the entire reason why I started this podcast is because I have women from multiple different companies coming to me. How do you do this? How do you do that? I I'm experiencing this my business. How do you get over that? You know things like that and I'm like girl. I don't even know I just saw sex. I was okay, but this is the reason why I started this podcast is because there's women that are my age in the same sort of industries that need help with these things and I cannot give a pat on the back to their upline because If your person is reaching out to you and you're ignoring them shame on you, if you were a person who is in a business like mine or industry where you have a sponsor you have an upline things like that and you're not reaching out to them for help shame on you as well. You have to ask for help. We are in this industry together. No one no one is going to turn you down at least in my company. No one is going to turn their head. No one is going to shy away from you. That's We do we are here to help so you're not alone. Okay, I'm going to wrap this up with this You are not alone. You have so many people that care about you and your business and I guarantee you you are not the first person to experience this. You're not the first person to say Fuck this I'm out right at all because girlfriend I've been there. I've quit my business like 48 times. All right, I'm not even gonna lie to you. I remember walking downstairs just bawling like I quit that's it. I'm done. April really sucks for me and I really don't want to put this out in the universe but I'm just being completely transparent with y'all. April sucks for me. It's my birthday month. I don't know if I just don't give a shit, but I have no great luck in April. It's not the greatest month for me when it comes to business and that's okay. I recognize it. I move forward and I change things every single year to try to set myself up for success, but I have had five parties cancel in one weekend. I have had people quit on me. I have had so many. Things happen that have shifted my mindset and I'm like, okay if this I'm out, I'm quit. I quit. I'm done. I don't want to do this anymore. Right? I take a few days. I have done all of these steps and I come back to my business with a fresh brain a fresh mind and a fresh Outlook. So take a little bit of these write them down, right the ones down that you're willing to do and the next time that you feel this way take a look at this. This list and try a few of these things.

I know that I know that employees and jobs and you don't really like feel like this. I know couples trying to get out of that feel like this. I know people that are believing God to bless them in a bigger way, and you know, you're in a small space. I know you This West I want to make this confession over your life. I said I want you to say this is significant. This is significant. This is significant running a vacuum cleaner. This is significant changing a diaper. This is significant coming home. Just being a good husband. This is significant. This is significant the devil won't like it when you say that because the way he gets you to leave your assignment is to convince you that it doesn't matter what you're working on. It's so small. so small, this is significant and don't wait to say that until it seems significant because that takes no faith. This is significant this this this not just that this is significant. Have you ever wanted a new car and you picked out the kind of car you wanted and the next thing you knew you started seeing that car everywhere. You went what happened? They just flooded the market with Car all of a sudden Google has an algorithm in your brain. And so they put the cars in front of you perhaps we're probably coming to that day, but it went to Amazon baby. It was your attention. You started seeing it. When you started searching for it. You want to like that matters make it matter. Make it matter make it matter. This is significant. It's a cloud the size of a man's hand and alleges that let's go. That's what we've been waiting for. It sucks. But it's a start it's small but it's a start I barely see it, but it's a start. We got a long way to go because we got in this famine three and a half years ago, and it's not going to be over overnight, but it's a start. It's a star and my start is significant. Can I show you one more thing? Can I if you need to leave go ahead and leave but I'm gonna take 10 minutes with everybody who wants to hear because if the enemy cannot get you to stay listen. He wants and I don't know if you believe in the devil, but you're brainless. Let's approach it from a psychological perspective. If you don't believe in the devil, you don't have kids but just in case you don't have kids and don't believe your brain is wired for survival. Okay, so when you're living in your head, all you're thinking about is survival. What has Elijah been doing for three and a half years before the drought was over? survival which in that three and a half year span was success because sometimes just making it is what matters just making it is what matters I mean just still being in faith is Victory sometimes but when the shift happens I wonder will you be ready for the rain you've been praying for because your brain if you stay inside your brain, your reflex will always be to run. What is Elijah been doing for the last three and a half years. What Come on talk to me Church. What's he even doing? He's been running surviving and running and surviving and running and surviving. So in the rain comes he runs and for a little while, he's running ahead of the rain. He's running in front of the Chariot because he's ready for his next. Simon is ready to serve Ahab. Now, he believes Revival has come to the nation. The bill profits have been destroyed. The answer of profits are laying at their own Alters dead in their own blood and now revival can come and so he runs 17 miles on the fuel of his faith on the fuel of the promise of God coming to pass in his life. He runs ahead of the Chariot. He runs ahead of the rain and then something happens because if the enemy can't kill you in the Is ability stage? for the insignificant stage The only thing left for him to do to keep you from receiving what God is pouring out in your life is intimidation. He can't keep God for making it rain. But maybe he can keep you from receiving it. You can get your run. Because I'm a runner. I'm a refugee and I'm a Rainmaker. But now I'm a refugee. What what what what what happens watch what happens when when Elijah should be celebrating the storm. I'll come back to that another week celebrate your storm celebrate your storm. We always preach about storms like a something we want to get out of what if the storm that God sent into your life was to prove his presence celebrate your storm celebrate your storm celebrate your storm celebrate. The storms just survive and celebrate the storms when they come because you know God is with you in the storm. He is an ever-present help in the time of trouble. And when the storm came and they have went down and told Jezebel what Elijah had done she knew that her days were number so she sends a messenger to Elijah and what happens next is going to shock you because you just watched the faith of a Rainmaker. And now you're going to see the fear of a renegade or runaway a refugee. And The Messengers come to Elijah. Come on. Let's play this out and they say Jezebel says she's gonna kill you. What we expect the scripture off the screen what we are expecting next is for Elijah to tell Jezebel where she can go with that noise and what she can do with her threats. Come on. What are you wish Jezebel would try to kill me. So what comes next to shocking against the backdrop of the boldness of a profit? I'll put his head between his knees and waited for Ray. Oh survived, three and a half years of drought was fed by the mouths of birds and at the house of a widow and now the rain has come and how the drought is over. And now first three Elijah was afraid never thought I'd see those three words. Never thought he would I mean I would have understood if he ran one of the drought. Was still in progress, but it's raining now. It's raining and Elijah the one who survived three and a half years of drought. Is running the Bible says he's running. for his life I don't buy it. I'm sorry. I don't buy it. I don't believe Elijah that you're afraid that Jezebel can kill you because if she could have killed you. She wouldn't have sent Messengers to warn you if she could kill you. She was Center bailiffs to arrest you, but she knows she can't kill you. So she's trying to contain you. Don't you know the devil found out a long time ago that he can't curse what God has blessed don't you know, the temple could have killed you by now, he would have killed you by now if he could have kept it from raining. He would have kept it from raining if he could have taken you out you'd be out. Assessing couldn't kill you and tries to contain you so he intimidates you and now Elijah is running. Please catch this he is running from the same rain that he prayed for some of us are better at surviving in famine than we are at living in blessing. What I mean what what I mean is when the rain started the one who ran ahead of the rain started running away from the rain. So the message God gave me for somebody today. You know who you are is that you are running from the rain you are running from the blessing of God, you are running from something that has already defeated you are running from shame that the cross of Jesus Christ has already taken away. You are running from a pal. Of sin that has already been broken you are running from situations that God has already worked out to our running from an outcome that you don't have to fear. Just what God's going to deal with Jessabelle and back in the right direction and run towards the rain. It's raining now, the trout is Topher come out of the trout. It's raining now. Why won't you run from the rain? Why would you run from the blessing of God see when you run from the resistance you run from the rain? When you run from the battle you run from the blessings when you run from the problem you run from the promise when you run from the problem you run from the Harvest. Why you running from You really believe that Jezebel can kill you after all you've already survived you really think Jezebel has the power in her mouth to stop what God is doing in your life. No, somebody shout. I'm coming out of the drought. I'm coming out of the trout up in try too long to feed it to all depressed too long discourage too long. It's a new season in my life.

I am very very excited as per usual to be recording this one here. I have a lot of different things on my mind for today's podcast. And so let's just Dive Right In the first one. Is that my life. Is not in a very good balance right now. I've been talking about this on various social networks over the past over the past little while and I want to talk about it and discuss the discuss this topic on the podcast. I think if we attack this if we attack this topic and we discuss this topic and we and we delve into this topic. I think it can help a lot of people who are listening to this podcast and I think it'll actually be very very good for myself as well. I find that when I talk about Whether it's to myself in this kind of podcast form or to someone else in real life or whatever it is often. It really helps me. So, you know the past I would say three to six weeks and most facets of my life. I'm not super happy with how I have been choosing to spend my time. When I look at my personal time, even though I have personal time and I'm putting time and energy towards things that matter to me that I enjoy. I'm not spending them in the way that makes me happiest. For example, when I look at the amount of YouTube, I'm watching I enjoy watching YouTube that is something I enjoy doing in my free time. But I'm so I'm watching too much like I would rather be doing other things with my free time and not spend that much time watching YouTube in other words. Maybe I'm watching whatever it is 5 hours of YouTube in a few day span and instead, I'd rather I'd rather be watching 3 hours of YouTube and doing two hours of hanging out with the Friend or something like that. I'm just not happy with the balance of where my free time is going at work. I'm also not happy. I'm working as much as I typically do not is not really something that is changed. But when I look at what elements of my work, I am putting at my attention on I don't feel right about it. I think it's too much time going towards certain things and not enough time going towards other things and that is a little bit of a problem when I look at my health and nutrition. I'm not really happy with where it is. I am sleeping about the same as I typically do but I'm not getting the same quality of sleep that I would like to be getting in comparison to what I used to get. I'm not getting the same quality and I feel that and I don't like that. I look at my nutrition and I'm not eating as well as I would like to be eating and I haven't been doing exercise for a good six weeks. Now, that's a problem. I was in a really good stretch for anybody who remembers when I came back from Taiwan. One I had a really good habit in place for a long time. There was a good I mean, I don't know four or five maybe more months where I was doing really well with my acting my physical activity and fitness and things like that and the past six weeks. I've fallen out of a lot of those those positive those positive habits and you know, these are things that are not good and I want to share this here because I think there's probably a lot of you who Either a are listening to this and thinking to yourself that man. I'm in a similar position right now. I'm not super happy with the balance of where I'm spending my time, and I'm not happy with the decisions that I'm making and even if you don't feel that now odds are that you felt it before or you're going to feel it at some point in the future and in my experience whether it has to do with language learning or really any topic, sometimes it's really difficult to see where You are like to see to really understand what you're feeling until you hear someone else talk about that feeling often with myself. I find that someone will say something that I believe in and that I have believed in for a long time or that or that I feel I feel the same way as the person who said it but I didn't consciously realize that I felt that way until that person said it and then I'm like, right I believe that you just put that you said that That in such a clear way and I didn't know how to express that feeling that I had inside me. Great. I have this extra level of clarity. And so hopefully me sharing this can give a couple of you an extra level of clarity of aha, that's kind of what's going on right now. That's why I don't feel quite right. That's why I'm not as happy as I typically am right now or like oh right six months ago. That's why I wasn't feeling quite good. I wasn't doing blah blah blah. So hopefully this helps a couple of you. How you know reach that extra level of clarity? I will share this today is a much better day for me and yesterday evening to about and yesterday as a whole lot actually has been a much better the past couple of days have been a lot better and I have been better with that level of balance. For example yesterday when I eat when I ate dinner, I had a cucumber like half of a maybe 40% of a long cucumber and I had half of an avocado with my dinner. That was a good decision. I have not been eating enough vegetables with my dinner for quite some time. So I felt really good about that. I had a pre bedtime snack and I ate spinach with my snack. Like I had some hummus. I had some some pita bread with it. And then I had some spinach and I was like, yeah, this is again not the most healthiest amazing thing in the world, but definitely pretty damn good. So, you know, I slept a lot better I made. Sure that I made the right decisions to make sure I can get a better quality of sleep. So ultimately I'm doing a lot better and I want to continue that continue that positive that positive momentum changing gears a little bit. I want to go in a language learning Direction seeing as this is obviously a language learning related podcast. Um, and I I want to talk about something that has been on my mind which is about Rote memorization or rather wrote language learning strategies. Maybe that's a better way to put it. So when you look at a lot of language learning classrooms and quite honestly, when you look at the mains many of the mainstream beliefs around how one should learn a language based on their personal experiences. There's quite a few people who believe in and very let's call it traditional wrote style of language learning strategies things like doing a whole bunch of work. Eats things like writing out verbs over and over and writing out their conjugations things like doing a whole bunch of repetitive practice dialogues from a textbook. These are things that people many people around the globe around the world that they do and I want to spend a minute or two discussing these because I personally am a little bit maybe a little bit conflicted about them on one hand. I believe that they are ineffective and they're not very why they're not great because they're so done engaging they're so boring most of the time and therefore it's something that is difficult to learn from often when it comes to learning a new skill. It has to be something that engages the mind and that gets you interested that keeps you engaged for lack of a better term. On the flip side a part of me also believes that these rote learning strategies are also quite effective and can really assist language Learners quite a bit because when you take out a piece of paper and you do these drills and you're writing out these verbs over and over or if you're doing spoken drills with different with different, what do you call it with different? Repeating certain scripts over and over like repeating. Hola como estas. Oh, I stoie bien Hi, how are you? Oh, I'm doing really good. How about you doing that repetition over and over will help it stick and I'm conflicted and I'm trying to figure out in my own mind. Like where is the line is it effective is not effective. Should we be doing rote learning strategies? Should we not I think my opinion as of today as I'm recording this in December of 2019. I think we're my mind and where my beliefs relieved lie, as of right now is that they work rote learning strategies are effective but only to an extent. So if you're struggling to remember for instance, the past tense conjugations conjugation rules for verbs in Spanish and you just cannot remember them and you keep forgetting them. I believe that it is going to be an effective activity and an effective drill. You just sit down for 20 minutes a day and actually write out seven different verbs in the past tense. I ate you ate. He ate she ate we ate in Spanish. It's way more complex than not an English is actually pretty easy. It's always ate but write it out over and over and over do it with another verb right out some practice sentences do the same thing again tomorrow. I think that can have that. I'm be effective and eventually your your brain is going to remember. Oh, yeah, I ate you ate it all over. Oh, yeah. I did. I walked I and your brains gonna start getting used to it and you are going to become a lot more familiar with that over time by doing those kinds of wrote boring types of activities. But here's the catch. This is where might this is my opinion as of today. There's a catch where eventually The effectiveness of the wrote style of learning where it tapers off. It doesn't quite it doesn't help you as much after a certain point and you have to start following up that rote learning strengths look rote learning strategy with other types of strategies. So for example, you know, let's say I was consistently forgetting some verb conjugation. Let's stick with that example and I spent all this time writing and over and over I did these written drills I did worksheet. It's and now my brain understands these conjugation rules on a theoretical level. If you give me a worksheet, if you tell me to write it out I can do it. But now in order to transfer that skill into a real-world environment where when you're speaking with an actual native speaker, and you actually are in a situation where you must you have a need of communicating something incorrect, you know in a grammatically correct way and saying it properly and getting your point across, you know, that's it. French skill set. And even though you've done a hundred worksheets, even though you've written it out a million times, even though you've done those you've done your role plays in class, right? Even though you've done it. It's a completely different skill set being able to apply that in a real-world environment and you will likely have to practice in real-world environments for the skill of writing it out on paper and doing rote memorization style drills. You're going to have to do something different in order to transfer that skill over. / and apply it in the real world. In fact this in my perspective as I'm pondering this right now. I actually think many skills and life work this way. If you look at being a I don't know being a surgeon my assumption. I don't know a lot about being a surgeon but my assumption is that you've got to write a lot of theoretical tests. You need to really understand on a theoretical level. How does the body work? What is human anatomy? Like, you know you have to The organs you have to understand the theory of what kind of scalpel is this? What kind of knife do you use in this situation? How do you operate on a kidney? How do you operate on a foot? How do you do this? How do you work that machine? What do you do if the blood pressure drops during the surgery? What do you do if the person wakes up from the anesthesia? I'm sure those all sorts of theory that these surgeons have to learn but being able to apply that theory in a real-world is something that's completely lately different because maybe they know okay if the person starts to wake up from the anesthesia, you know, I'm supposed to follow this procedure. I don't even know what the procedure is, but I'm sure there's a procedure to follow but maybe what they didn't expect is a person wakes up from anesthesia and they start to get scared and like oh my God, what do I do? And then the nurse who's helping you out knocks the scalpel off of the counter because she got startled and you're like oh and then you get startled you being able to Handle that situation is completely different than you being able to write the test and and complete the test in a classroom environment though for you to even have a shot at having any level of success in the operating room. You probably would have had to have learned the theory and studied the theory to an extent and done some of the memorization drills and written the test done. All of that. You would have had to have done a bunch of that first in order to even have the shot and a prey Rare of being allowed into the operating room while language learning is nowhere near a life-and-death scenarios such as an operating room potentially could be and there are there are way less dire consequences of making a mistake with a language. Then there are in an operating room as a surgeon. I think in many ways these Concepts kind of apply if you haven't studied something in a classroom environment. In fact, let me rephrase that if you haven't learned how something Works and on a theoretical on a knowledge base level whether that be in a classroom environment whether that be because you have someone taught it to you whether that be because you followed a study at home program hack whether that be because you went to a real life scenario made a mistake and learn from the mistake and you thought about it and he pondered it and blah blah blah, you know, and unless you'd actually spend some time learning how something worked there's no way you're gonna be able to properly apply it in their interest. In a real-world scenario, it's going to be really difficult and therefore using a rote learning strategy is one of many techniques that any of that language Learners can utilize in order to learn the theoretical side of how something works in a foreign language. Please understand that it's not the only way that's not the only way that a language learner can learn the theory there are so many other ways you could do it, but I think Stan's my position as of today as of this December 2019 is that rote learning strategies are not necessarily bad, but it's less than half the equation. It's just one tool that partially remedies and partially solves the problem of not knowing how a specific thing works in a language and being able to get closer to understanding it digesting it and being able to apply it but it's not going to be the only thing that one has to utilize it reminds me actually have a podcast. I heard it reminded me of I don't know if you guys know of The Joe Rogan podcast. I don't list. I think it's called The Joe Rogan Experience. I don't listen to every single episode to be perfectly honest. I just listen to certain clips from time to time on YouTube. If I if it happens to come across my feed and there is this one interview this one clip that I listen to whether discussing they were discussing. It was either being Bodybuilder and something with physical fitness or it was around financial success. I don't remember what the exact conversation was. My gut is telling me right now that it was about physical fitness that's kind of where my mind is going and her on bodybuilding. It's kind of like saying if you look at bodybuilders, you know, all of them have big muscles and let's assume that they're very very strong and very good shape and it's like saying, oh all of them drink Water that's why they have big muscles. It's not true. Right? Yes. They drink a lot of water. Yes, that is important. Yes, that is something they have to do but it's not the only part of the equation they do so much more. They go to the gym. They eat a certain way. They have personal trainers. They they they learn about how the Body Works they they learn about how to recover when they have an injury, they learn the so much that they do and it's not just about drinking water and I think that When you look at these wrote strategies and really any language learning strategy, I think anytime someone goes and puts all their eggs in one basket and they say that this strategy is the way you know, I always go in my mind. Yeah in many ways sure. Yes, and it's probably a part of the equation most likely or it'll work for some people but not exactly for everyone and this that the other thing so this is a definitely a massive thing that was on my mind today that I wanted. To share on the podcast the final thing. I want to share and then we'll wrap this podcast episode up has to do with my personal Mandarin my personal Mandarin studies and I want to share a learning point that I've had a bit of a realization that I've had that I believe can help a lot of the people listening here on this podcast episode. So recently in Mandarin, I've hit this kind of level of comfort. I've hit this this point where I'm like, wow, you know what you could stick. In front of native speakers and while I'm might still struggle while I don't know all the words while I still haven't studied all the grammar. I've achieved a certain level of comfort where I don't get as nervous as I used to and I'm able to navigate situations way more than I could before I had a I had the situation yesterday where I was with a friend of mine and we were hanging out and she speaks Mandarin. We only speak in Mandarin together. It's kind of a new friend that I've made recently. And she was helping me with some my Mandarin studies. I helped her with some Spanish and English things like that. She helps me with mandarin and we're sitting there together and we're going through this particular page in my textbook and she's like has earned. You're still taking Chinese classes and I was like, yeah, I still take classes. I'm still learning. Like I still have a long ways to go and she goes but but you can understand everything I say and we can talk about anything and you can get your point across. I understand you you understand everything I say. She's like, why are you learning? She's like, why are you learning Mandarin? Why are you continuing her studies and makes no sense. You're already fluent and that in that moment. I was like, oh is that how I'm viewed by many people are there people that view me that way like, oh, he's fluent. Why is he still learning? So that was a big moment for me like a big moment of success and second of all what I told her and this is I think many language Learners can relate I told her that yeah, of course like yeah, we can sit down we can talk. Talk we can we can we can and we can we can we can communicate and blah blah blah, but I still have to stop you sometimes and say hey, can you repeat that or I'll still have to ask you o what does that word mean? And you'll have to use a synonym and then I'll understand it or then or you'll have to explain it and then I'll understand it and she's like, it's not a big deal. I was like what's not a big deal, but I want to get to a point where I almost never have to ask you to explain something. I almost never have to ask you to repeat something. I almost never have to be like, how do you read that character? Like I want to get to that. Late fees like oh oh and anyway, what I wanted to point out was a couple things first of all, it's been a five-year Journey for me. In fact, maybe even a little bit more than five years if I'm thinking back, I believe my Mandarin Journey started in September of 2014 if I remember correctly and we are now in event December of 2019. So when in fact if I'm not mistaken, it's been more than five years now a little bit more. So it's been a little bit more than five years in order for me to achieve a certain level of comfort with this language and I was reasonably consistent with my studies. There were moments in time where I wasn't studying there might be a three-month stint right in studied and practice vitamin a six-month stint here. Like there were moments in time where I definitely wasn't practicing and studying but I think it gets made up with the fact that I've done a lot of intensive study. I went to Beijing for three months. I went to Taiwan. Or Taiwan for we think two months. I did a two or three week intensive stint Rose being four to eight hours of Mandarin a day in Calgary. So I was like in online lessons for four to eight hours a day. So that was something I did. So I've done a lot of intensive study. So I think which makes up for a lot of the lulz where I wasn't doing any kind of study consistently so generally five and a bit years of pretty consistent study. D in order to achieve I would say kind of like a mid B1 level a mid intermediate level which is a very respectable level than in my perspective. It's really to be honest. That's kind of the level that most a lot of language Learners are trying to achieve in their target languages. They don't want to be super super duper fluid like a native speaker. They just want to have a decent level where they can talk to native speakers. They can hang out they can have some friends. They can talk. They don't it's not a huge mental strain. And so that's the thing. I want to stress for everybody. Like it will take I've said this a million times. It will take a number of years for most of you in order to achieve that level second of all, I want to point out that in order at least in my experience in order to achieve a reasonably strong level in a language. I believe you need a mixture of two different types of language learning strategies that are happening simultaneously at the same time. Number one you're going to need some let's call it more academic style of learning what I mean by that is you're going to need something whether it's a teacher whether it's a study at home program, whether it's like an unofficial teacher. It could be a friend who just helps you out whether it's like a YouTube video series whether you're going to need something that helps you build the foundations in your target language something that helps. Understand at least at a basic level how some of the pronunciation Works how the writing system works how some of the grammar points work how what's the difference between this vocab word and that vocab word like you're going to need something. It doesn't have to be super structured and super traditional or super boring, but you will need something that is slightly more. I'm going to use the word academic something more on the academic or structured side of things to help you build. Build the foundations of the target language and then on top of that you're going to second part of the equation, which is some more casual styles of practice listening to music doing language exchanges traveling abroad getting a boyfriend or girlfriend and dating someone for a bit volunteering somewhere and getting some real hands-on experience could be something like who knows right could be there's a lot of ways could be starting a YouTube channel where you try and talk in the language. Could be who knows something that's more casual something that is more taking place in the real world. I suppose you could say in my perspective. I think a healthy balance of the two is a formula for Success at least for me in my experience and based on what I have seen what works for different language Learners. So I want to talk about that. I want to share that piece of advice for you because it's been a big thing that's helped me in Mandarin in French and in Spanish and heck even in Gujarati and every And every foreign language, I've gone out to learn that has been a massive a huge part of the equation for me, and I think I can work for a lot of you too. Anyway, this is gone for good 25 minutes. So, I appreciate your attention. You guys are the best and we will talk very very soon. Bye for now.

But yeah, let's get into it on so I we actually just told me I'm a sports agent talked about this beforehand that we believe this Countries were standing there saying it is. Um, I don't know if you saw bro, but he won on the some kind of podcaster radio station last night and basically was talking about the injury dude, and he said Mike from Moneyball. Yeah, since it's hurting him that money going awesome. Yeah, and I maybe thats reason why he came in late to Michigan State no one even mentioned that maybe you think it treatment on I don't know. But anyways guys, so what it originally started off with Tom Is it saying he'll be out, you know for Sunday's game against Proctor's it could be you know a day situation, but then the people that were on campus saying well now he's in a boot, you know, he had snap chats with the boot so I can confirm that screw. And then now it's to the point is I was saying the other day that are you currently paying off student debt interested in improving your financial literacy or looking for new ways to earn income and today's ever-changing digital landscape on the talk money with mesh lakhani podcast. Astro file paperwork shows travels experts break down complex ideas to bring Clarity to the mystical Financial phenomena.

Oh now my Pita week to week to week basis any might be out. He's right about that. Let him talk about in a minute. But that means that's what it sounded like to me guys. It was a was it a stress reaction if I'm not mistaken. Yeah, something wrong with this dress. Yeah, so the stress reaction guys and it's now as I was saying, you know could be he could be out a week and then I don't know if it's true, but I heard someone say week the week and that's exactly how the jobs Lankford injuries started out. But yeah guys, that's basically where we're at with rocket. I think the news is a lot Not this he's not the news. I think the injuries. I'm not going to say a lot worse, but it's definitely a little worse than what they say to that person. What do you what do you think about the whole injury and just about everything? You know, you could I don't care whatever you want to talk about. I mean, I think it I think it could be something minor like like what they're saying is just taking a little bit longer to heal than expected. But to there's that possibility that he could be out for the whole year like we don't know dude like it sounds crazy to say but they did the same thing with link Roots like I don't know what to say. Spectrum like MSU be Ballin understand football they always lie to us about injuries. And I don't know why it's a good point that you just brought up because I want a lot of you guys to listen when he just said they like did not that they lie to us, but they're very they don't inform your very big brother just raw numbers are very stingy with like giving out information guys. It's not like the NBA were all these guys are calling. Whoa Janowski telling them what the news is Michigan state is not liked to open their mouths about certain shit, but I mean with that case Eyes, that's why we never you guys are asking me. You know, what are we gonna do for whatever its football fields of corn at all this I tell you I don't know because dantonio doesn't say shit. I mean when slurry comes on here and I'll text them here and there dude. He doesn't know half the stuff. I mean, so basically guys, I mean we can we can talk a little more about it because we didn't really discuss that much but Another thing I wanted to bring up just because people are going to buy one each, you know here we have to think what do you think about the whole medical staff and you know, you know, I mean you saw the post I made guys about the guy in Twitter saying should we start questioning the staff? Oh, yeah. I mean, what do you think there's you know that it's just bad luck or like or it's actually a terrible medical staff because at this point, I feel like one year you can say, oh, we got unlucky with injuries, but it's become. Like a theme in the pattern, especially the football thing like since 2016 did we have been just absolutely plagued by injuries, like like like I've never seen before it's ridiculous, especially in football and basketball. I feel like it's been more unfortunate. It's not with medical staff will feel like they do a good job, but the football team and Spotify you can listen to all of your favorite artists and podcast in one place for free.

So you never miss an episode of MSU sports podcast that it's a concern. I really think someone needs a change there and I was going to just break before you said that you're like reading my mind. I was going to ask you when do you think the injury is started and to be Did you do I don't remember the football happening until floor key sophomore year. I mean, yeah, he got hurt that game against Michigan not even the work you guys I'm just saying in general major injury, like I don't ever since he broke his leg against Michigan. Okay, but he believes he didn't even play that year that they just threw him in for a game. Like I don't the McDowell injury that your do those this car. Was it McDowell Malik McDowell. Yeah, but I mean other than that. Didn't get hurt that your two Bridges about for a while to not yeah, but I didn't mean it like that year. Valentine missed a few weeks at his senior year, but that wasn't any major and then it started coming up guys then it was Ben Carter for basketball and that it was obviously Kyle arms the last basic last three to four years. It's been hurt. But yeah, I mean, I don't really know but I wanted to you know, just talk about that because a lot of people do a lot of people are going out my neck for that one saying, you know, we have one of the best medical staffs in the country. You don't know what you're talking about. And like I said in the post guys I wasn't I've seen the medical staff. I just said is it time for them to start? I don't know what the right word is to use but you know just start I guess questions also use I don't know dude like with do cash his family. They that he gets hurt. They say like something like oh it's going to be a month or two like Christmas when he's gonna be back. He's back in four days. What is that? Do they have like a special substance like from Karate Kid? Like, what is that? How'd you do? And that's honestly I don't mean to be like this guy's but that's funny Coach K would literally said we don't expect him back a day before Christmas, maybe New York and he legit like do coverage came on here and he was right. He said he maybe was going to play against us. Yeah, he wasn't he was almost right guys to the deeply the next game a Virginia Tech One game with that injury. What was he maybe maybe was out what six days if I mean, so I mean, that's all topic but that is a good Point to make you know, that mean basically what he's saying guys is that when they thought was worse ours are steaming like every time we think it's not as bad as it is and it turns out worse. So that's the case with his rocket one. I mean, we don't really have to make this a long podcast, but I think I mean doing or nothing. Bringing up rocking how and is that the same thing like I don't understand that. He hasn't been really much things good for us to share his thoughts were play solid defense. Dave has been very consistent. I'm sorry if he played more minutes. I think you've been I mean, I'm all right. How about to say that? I mean you're on the same page as Gabe. Ron II don't know why he wasn't starting to begin the air. I think yeah, maybe a few games. So strong here and there but the thing is he's not just a few terrific said like I don't know if you've been watching us, he's been rebounding awesome crash the boards. Yeah, but what's he doing wrong? Like you're saying that is those not complimenting some complimenting them enough? Like maybe not is he not also in his heart, but he had that crazy dunk that one game you seem to always go hundred percent, but you know, it is all dude. Like he just really likes lockdown Defenders. I think that's the reason why he's been really Pro rocket this whole time because let's just be honest rocket has been phenomenal on the defensive end but his shots been atrocious and It's been as bad as probably Draymond greens was last year with golden state and that's a lot. I mean if he was shooting the ball, he was expire guys. Like, you know, we'd be up here like rocket there's something wrong with the rest of the year. She watches the man, but I don't know what happened. I tried to tell you what happened and you eat it. I mean not that you didn't listen, but I'm pretty sure he's not playing this position dude. I don't think he played that good of art first great player will follow Wednesday. You don't drop see me like three four points per game. It's just how I don't get that should at least be putting up 10 per game, especially if you're starting you did drop 64 your right foot. But then again, he was a highly touted one. So then the clock, you know, it's like I don't know but I think is over saw an offseason. He was struggling so he said put more emphasis on the defense and that's what he did. I don't know though, dude. I don't know. You know, I'm not I'm not nearly given up on ragi. Yeah. I'm actually you know, but I think the guy is really good. He has a lot of potential but He shot his husband phone. But to close this out guys. Basically the theme of this podcast was about us saying that the rocket injury could be worse than is Owen all of them expected in that. They're all telling us. I don't know about you, but I don't anticipate him to play Saturday against Oakland. Do you? Yeah, I mean, like I said earlier if you guys didn't hear me, he's he's been seen walking around with the boot on. Oh, yeah, like I mean dude like oh, yeah, maybe I'm overreacting that but that's the second hit. What dude I still I'm actually seeing things more than the original statement Will C be out for like two weeks and then all of a sudden two to four weeks six days two to four months out for the year like just progressed and I don't know. And we're not laughing guys. We're just saying like how the uncertainty behind it is. Like it's just crazy how one minute it could just switch like that, but I don't remember exactly what the length of the injured Lankford injury was a soldier. It was something less than a month. I remember I want to say I'm like what the fuck is going on? Okay, maybe. You might be right because I think it was three to four weeks because I think he got hurt like December 20 something and then we were like, all right. He might be able to play. I don't know what the game was. We're like, all right, maybe Michigan know I keep thinking I'll miss you was two months. Yeah, so no, you're definitely right. It probably was a lot shorter than six weeks. But basically guys, I mean like you said, we don't anticipate rocket to play this week. We know we're not experts or nothing. So hopefully know What listen to this is going to you know, get out our neck, but all we're saying is we think the rocket injury is a little worse than is on them stated up first rocket rocket even clarified that in though the talk show last night saying he's been a sea bass. He hasn't been himself put it in terms sense summer special. I mean, basically Okay, but here's something out of yeah, but here. Maybe by mrs. Terrible to say maybe by March Madness. He'll be himself. We don't know guys. He might be back literally could be back Saturday could be back could not play against Michigan for all me and you know, yeah ridiculous. I'm gonna but I mean that's basically all I have to say you got anything else to add, you know, that's about it. Yeah, great this we didn't yeah exactly. I was going to say we didn't want to make this one too long guys and drag it out. We just want to get to the point. But the last thing I was going to say is, you know, I'm going to text, you know few people that I know that are close to see what they have to say. I'll let you know too. I mean do this is just nuts guys. I mean, no looking for no rocket. No Hauser ovaries. Keep mounting guys. So put it like this. I'd be more surprised to see a tweet. Come in saying rocket is playing this Saturday against Oakland for this Thursday against Oakland, then they started yet then a tweet from the end saying he's out for the year for like that. Yeah, I'm not going to I'm not going to put it at that extent but I don't know like like I would be more surprised be playing The Saturdays and if he's out for the Earth like it's no I mean, yeah, if you're going to pin me against that that I'll agree with that because I don't think he's going to place at it's just fun and like like like what's his name Cassius Stanley? Like people are like, yeah like Christmas nothing four days later. He's playing like, what is that? Oh and you know, it's cool crazy. I mean ya know basically that's it man. That's all I got to say. I'll tell you after I was in this like we gotta find a way like if a player is hurting through like a leg injury throughout the summer and throughout the weekend of the year. How is our medical staff not like treating that with Ultimate Care. I don't understand just just telling like to every need he has before after practice. Maybe they are doing that. Maybe it's just another excuse or just something that just came up. I don't know but I just feel like it gets old at some point. Having a for too long something needs to change and that's that's the landed on guys that statement you just made is absolutely true is of crap. I forgot the last thing you said, but basically he was saying, you know that not that they're lying to us, but that I don't know. I don't even know what to say. I'm not going to spray along with some bullshit. But that's a good statement to close it out on will probably upload this one after right. But yeah, I mean, yeah, yeah, you're gonna want to hear this so I mean nothing more to add on. I'll be back tomorrow. We got two guests coming on hopefully so they yeah, dude. We're going to be a lot of gas coming on this offseason guys. But yeah, that's it. Basically right man. Yeah. Sure appreciate you guys for tuning in and then go green light.","– Michigan State basketball player Branden Dawson suffered a season-ending injury in the first half of his team's game against Rutgers on Tuesday, and ESPN's sources say it's more serious than first thought.

ESPN's sources say Dawson tore his ACL while going for a rebound and was injured on the same play in the second half. Michigan State coach Mark Dantonio said after the game that he didn't know for sure whether Dawson would be ready for the start of Big Ten play in January, but he said he was optimistic he'd be able to play, per the Detroit Free Press.

Are your hosts Fred Hicks and Sam Jones. What's up, guys? Hope you're having a good Friday when you're listening to this Sam. What's up? Not much man. Just sitting out here getting ready for lacrosse putting some stuff together start to pack up. So having a having an Oktoberfest and enjoying the evening. Yep. So you had a pretty big weekend, huh? I saw Yeah, one too shabby wasn't too shabby. So you went out to a little late called Waveland and caught a few fish. You did more than just catch a few fish. You won the dang thing. Well, you know, hey is my day I guess and I beat Jim strong. Yeah, hold on Jimmy. Yeah, I fished with inside a gym all day and you know, we got to we got to chat a little on the water. So it was a good tournament, you know, unfortunately for the rest of the field fishing was pretty tough and a lot of guys didn't get to see what Waveland is really all about. Me and Jim were the only two with a with a limit. Actually, I believe there was one of the guy chip who may have had a limit or for fish. Like that. I can't remember what I heard but never found signal to upload and didn't have enough to really stress about it. So but yeah, it was definitely a tough event. And you know, I was fortunate enough to come out on top. Yeah. I'm sitting here looking at your to 17 inches, man. These things are pigs. Yeah. They're the they're fatties for sure that Lakes got you know, six seven eight nine Pounders in it that are caught pretty regularly. I mean, even if you look at the 14 inch fish, I caught well almost 15. But yeah that they all had some pretty good girth to him. I mean in a way and tournament that would have been a good bag, you know? Oh definitely. Wow, so and they were they fought to man. They were they were fun to catch. You know, they were deep well wavelengths not a very deep lake but deep for Waveland and you know, it was it was a good time. There's a good time so is definitely a grind but you know, I was able to find five of the right ones. Yes, you want to go through those results for that? Yeah. Yeah, we'll talk about it here. So again, there was only two limits caught myself and Jim Strunk. I landed 81-75 Jim coming in at 78 25 really making me kind of sweat it all day. Funny enough the the to our Shores spots on that life that I planned on fishing. He was on one of them and I was on the other and we neither neither of us never left our spot. So I knew he was going to I knew he had the potential at any second to crack again a six seven eight nine powder. And so did I so I finished the last second and so did he and then rounding out the top 3 was Randy Doris with 59 25 for for fish. And then yeah kind of we had Chad Howard and fourth place with 5775 just one shy of his limit and then Thomas McNulty which 4175 and fifth place. So Club Championship 14 Anglers out there on Lake Waveland. I had to qualify for the event through either win an event throughout the regular season or by points. And you know, we got out there conditions were tough. Russians were very tough. In fact, we had multiple weather changes. We went from 92 40 back to 70 back to the low 60s day of the tournament. We started out with clouds and Rain then it a little sprinkle anyway, and then we had a downpour then we got sun and clouds then clap Sun than clouds with a little bit of rain after the tournament. So kind of interesting weather and it made things. Go for a lot of guys. Luckily. I was on the offshore thing. So that is little less affected by those quick changes and you know had a good event good stuff. That's awesome, man. So that's your second one of the year, right? Yeah second win of the Year second win in the kayak first championship and the kayak. So super excited about that looking at the two little Club trophies. I got sitting on the The Shelf over there here in the garage and kind of be prouder. You know now we got one more we got to go to La Crosse and get it done. Oh, yeah, that'd be dude. If you win. That would be awesome. Well, heck if you or Brian wanted that would be awesome. Well, that's the plan man. We're going to go up there and represent it. Hell. Yeah. Hell yeah. Hell yeah, that would be cool. So there is a there was another tournament that went on on Saturday and you know apologize to tie and Ryan Lambert and the guys the tournament directors over there. We missed it on our report last week, but we want to make sure we go over the results this week. So the tournament of Titans hosted by Native Watercraft went on October 5th. That was on the Big G, Guntersville. You know, there were gosh. I heard there's a lot of guys their ton of guys there. I mean there was over 70. I know I'll look real quick. I'll pull it up here. Yeah hundred hundred eighteen guys competing in that one of which was Bassmaster Classic Champion, none other than Jordan Lee out there fishing with these guys and it was one heck of a lot of it. I watched it all day washed away in live afterwards and Really impressive. So I'll just kind of round off the top five here real quick. Yeah will do top 10 will do top 10 real quick and you know give these guys some shout outs but really cool event. And I think we'll be seeing some more of these in the future, you know, the winners got like you top five people. I think God to tighten boat and plus was less their price later Max. No, I think I know I don't think it was later Max. It's a sweet boat though. Cool. Boot. Yeah, I think it was just the regular Titan 10.5 I got was so but Covenant with 9250 and first place Nick Huddleston really impressive bag had a 2075 in 1925 1850 1775 and a 1625. So really strong bag coming in second place with B5 he was gunning hard for this one Ryan Lambert out of Tennessee. We all know that name third place another angler out of Tennessee John McClane Lima cleanly 91 inches Randall Wallace coming in fourth place with 90/50 Chris Lowe rounding out the top five with 90. Even we had Tony Yang out of Georgia with 88 75. Five. Mr. Jim Clark himself, Alabama native there 8850 Christine Fisher. No surprise there grabbing another top 10 just crushing it out there this year 87-75 and then our Bassmaster Classic Champion Jordan Lee with 8750 coming in ninth place and then rounding out the top ten. Drew Russell of Kentucky with 86 75. So there's your top 10 right there. Again, Nick hosting grabbing the wind with 9250. That's awesome. Yeah, absolutely think big bass for that event was right at 21 inches and you know, really a lot of a lot of big fish actually a lot of fish over 20 cotton out of it. That's cool. Real cool. Next one we have here is Virginia kayak Bass Challenge Classic on the Chickahominy Lake / river. Shout out to Casey read. This is his Tournament Trail out there in Virginia. First place was Bruce deal. Eighty four point seven five inches second place Steve Bishop 80 and a half inches and third place was Micah Marlborough 79 inches Big bass went to Dustin good 22 inch bass. So good. Yes it is. Okay. Yeah, next one we have here Massachusetts kayak Bass Fishing catch em all full bro. This was public Waters. This one was really interesting. So I didn't really read like the rules or anything but after looking at the results, like wow, this is crazy first place Steve and Scott 471 and a half inches. So I think they totaled all his fish. I think they totaled everybody's fish altogether. So there was like no really no limit. So if you cut it's like I don't I'm not 100% sure I didn't count. How many teen was it was? I think it was 15 baths wasn't it? I'm not sure about that now can a man 471 inches. Yeah, that's great. 271 fish were caught by 27 Anglers. Group 471 that is awesome. This is no limit tournament says so. Yeah, so it says is there was way more than 271 fish caught I mean he caught 36 fish total for 471 inches. So it was MLF that style format. Yeah, you know and they got Fish Public Waters so very very neat format and you know his big bass I think was 19 inches. Steven Scott so really cool. Yeah. Second place was Alan cynic with a four hundred four hundred sixty two and three-quarter inches third place was John Farah 414 and a quarter inches and big bass Cameron Burke 19 and a half. So real cool tournament there. I like that. They it was just how many you could catch. That's that's real cool. Yeah, I'd like to do an MLF format at some point. I think it would be fun to do. I'm still you know, I prefer the five fish limit. Yeah, you know as far as the tournament format all together, but I wouldn't mind fish and some MLF style events. So definitely look we'll be looking out for That next year to do one of those. Yeah. And then the last one we have here is the rtt state championship by the kayak Bass Anglers of Arkansas. Like watch atoll. Chris Jones came in with a hundred seventy inches second place is Jeff Watts, a hundred sixty nine and a half inches third place Steven Lee hundred fifty three inches and big bass was Bill Campbell with 22 inch bass. Okay. So those those numbers I try to compare it to the FLW kbf cup date. They were around the same type of numbers. It looks like wow. This is a little bit higher. But yeah as a little bit higher and then like the thing with the kbf event, you really saw a a huge drop off after kind of like that top top five. It really kind of started to drift off off. So this is a little bit more consistent little further down. Out in the field. You can definitely start to see that the lake start to heat up or cool down and the bite start to heat up. So, you know tournament in a Champions here in about a month. It's going to be it's going to be really cool to see what's going on out there. There's been a lot of a lot of tournaments held on this Lake this year and I think we'll continue to see that because it's just it's got some really awesome potential. So Tournament of Champions is on watch at all. It is. Yep, November November 10th is when that one will be held so and unfortunately, we'll talk a little bit about this here in a minute the Turkey Bowl which is a tournament that I host. I mistakenly scheduled that for the same day as the Tournament of Champions. So some of the guys that would have would have been able to make it unfortunately will not be there. So, you know we Live and learn. Yeah, it's all good. That's all we got for Recaps. Absolutely, not a lot of cool events happened last weekend. Yeah, you got some some cool events coming up that will be will be talking about here in just a minute after we do an interview with our epic guest tonight.

Welcome back to the real down guys tonight. We have our epic guest Eric Siddiqui. He won the crossroad Crossroads classic and Newton Lake and Illinois. We were just going to get him on and talk a little bit about little bit about that. So, how you doing? How you doing? I'm good, man. Good. How are you stuff, man? I'm doing good. So let's start off by. You telling the listeners who you are, like what kind of kayak you're in? What got you in the kayak fishing? I'm Eric Siddiqui. I'm from Cincinnati Ohio been calculation for about five years. Currently. I'm fishing out of a ho BPA 14. And yeah, enjoy it. That's what year is that PA 14. So 2016. Yeah 60 run. Are you gonna get into that 360 Drive Otto will see after row see if I can get out of that 16, you know things got Mojo. Yeah. Yeah one or two tournaments one or two more tournament wins. You'll be fine. You'll be able to upgrade. Yeah, we'll see. So how have you been fishing your whole life then or just yeah have of Bank fish most of my life. I grew up here in Cincinnati and my mom's from Corinth, Mississippi. So I'll go down there in the Summers and fish Pickwick and just get dropped off the lake and try out different lures and stuff and kind of taught myself how to bass fish that way as I got older I got, you know a little bit. Better tried some different stuff and then it was about five six years ago. I started watching chat over on kayak Bassin and I was like, I can do that. Yeah, like and I was fishing the lake at the time where I was catching some big fish and I knew if I get out there on it. I could you know Hammer I'm so excited to go get a kayak and went and got one got out there and That's always your first kayak first guy like was in Ascend FS1 28t from Bass Pro. Nice. There you go. So that's funny. Everybody start slow and then work their way up after a while. Yeah, man. I took all the hatches off it resealed it. I add a huge marine battery on it to run my lights and Fish Finder. I didn't know anything much about you know, all that stuff. So I just got a big one. It was I got it. They had to weigh 50 pounds and that on the back. Is there a reason you cheaper? I mean I couldn't get a boat on a lot of the lakes that I was fishing around here in Cincinnati. Yeah. What was your favorite? Steady, like I like I like the gravel pits around Cincinnati. Everybody got overlooked some nobody. Nobody really fishes them everything that gets fished hard around here. Kind of sucks. So yeah. Did you just did you just try to like Sly your way into finding out Eric siddiq? He's like honey hole is that it's so yeah, we'll get GPS coordinates after this. Yeah. I'm just joking, but let's get into the tournament stuff. This Crossroads classic at Newton Lake. How many days did you pre fish for that? I got there Wednesday night and I plan on just you know, crashing at the boat ramp and up early and free fishing, but when I got there they were just kind of going off crushing the crush dad and I was like, I can't take this I gotta get out there on the water. So so I got out there and sun was setting as I got in the water and I pulled around in this little pocket that was full of hydrilla and start Runnin ChatterBait over top of it and I had 99 Doesn't two hours out there, so I was there that's pretty special place. We're gonna have fun and get out of there the next day and had some deeper stuff marked. I wanted to look at and on the way I have to say to one of those spots. I found this road bed Ed with a bridge on it that wasn't on any of my maps or anything and and it had some fish on it. So 10 casts I had a 21 and 19 and 18 and a half. Half and it was decided probably just look for some shallow stuff around there in case I had trouble getting a limit because I know how those roadbeds go like you're tough. So yeah guys there was a connection issue you thought you heard him say Road bed and bridges. He was talking about brush piles and 25th little are you heard that wrong or I think of the I had a few drinks at the tournament and talked a lot. So I figure the Secret's out by now anyway, Yeah, it's not too much of a secret fear for anyone who's been around the lake long enough. But yeah, very cool. So I know by by you stating that but for the listeners cold water or hot water side, were you on the generating side or the cold water side? I was on the cold water side. Yeah. Yeah. Did you pitch it all the hot water? I didn't I didn't go up there even. When I got there ones and I didn't really know anything about the lake and I just happened to go up the cold side when I was fishing and I just kind of stayed over there. So what's the temperature difference between how cold was the Cold Water side? I want to remember it was around 81 maybe. Yeah, since the other side was a lot warmer than that, obviously, so there it was up there. The 90s resting when I just might yeah, I know it should be in like the high 90s right now in the winter time. So like in January, it should be in the 70s. The weather wasn't miserable. We'd go out there on January 1st of the year. Now that's cool. It's real cool. So, um did this tournament have like a different field and other major tournaments you've fished. It was it was a lot of fun. I had a good time. It was kind of a relaxed thing. I went out and that month and I started on Pickwick lake and after that first tournament I kind of decided I wanted to just stay on the road and Fish on my tournaments that I had coming up. So I and I wanted to qualify for some extra money at the cross for the Alan stuff I'd only fished one online. So as I did I could stay on the road and kind of work my way around the tournaments. And so I Pickwick first which is an Alabama fish that Alabama online Mississippi online Arkansas online and Missouri online. So I started a Pickwick fish that tournament had four good fish the first day couldn't get that last one and I end up with second biggest bass both days behind Chris. Dean Fisher and so then I had I left there and went to Mississippi official Lake on over there for a nighttime put up like ninety eight and a half inches that day and I went over and fishing Arkansas with Cody Milton stay with him for a couple days. He turned me on to a lake and brought me out there and I decided fish Jackson's tournament also and went out that next day after after a day of fishing the lake and put 109 in between 7 a.m. And noon. Yeah, I select the tournament. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah and up with a hundred and ten inches in Arkansas and then left there went to Table Rock. It came in fourth there. And then I went from there up to Kansas City Fish for with Am A Lash for a day and then I headed over to Illinois and for some by then. I was almost ready to get home, but it was It was it was good time. Enjoy that tournament a little more relaxed and everything else. I've been through the whole time. I was I pretty much compost everything I wanted to in my trip. So kind of the pressure was off. What do you think about the the team style? Yeah. There was a lot of fun. I like that type of stuff. Yeah. It was a good time. I try to give the guys as much help as I could but We I think we had a fourth. Yeah, I was about this. That's about to say did you guys like do any kind of strategizing for that tournament or what trying to I mean, I tried to tell them how I was cashing them and what I would do and you know, but everybody fishes differently. So yeah, you know almost in their people by spreading the word too much right? Let's try and do stuff that they're not comfortable with. Yeah, right kind of put you in like the middle. There because you you're wanting to do well yourself for the individual part, but then the other side of it you you want the team to win also write like it's like you I don't know. It's kind of like I'd be stuck in that situation. I wouldn't know. Yeah, I pretty much told them everything. Okay, cool. I mean everything that I knew I let him let him know but you guys were sharing spots and everything then. I gave him some spots and stuff like that. I told me come fish out there with me if they wanted but I don't think even really wanted to do that. Yeah. That's cool, man. Yeah, I've never fished a team tournament like that. So it's interesting to hear. Yeah. The first one I ever did was the team cup for the kbf national championship this year. Yeah. I was a good time. We did early in it. After that first day. We did talk to the guy the guy that was on the winning team of that earlier this year. I think yeah came out of the movie x-series. Yeah. That was real cool. So let's let's get let's get The tournament day number one go into some detail how you were fishing what you were using like the type of areas you targeted. Yeah, well see I started out I had a long way to go and I was happy we had a shotgun start. So I was pretty happy that we were able to use Torpedoes that I have one of those on the back for three. Yeah, and I was pedaling as hard as I could and we have that torpedo on full blast to get out there and I still lost five or 10 minutes by the time I got there and yeah, I had a pretty good pretty good morning at. Three good ones. Well, I'd to pretty quick. I think it was 21 and 19 and a half maybe pretty quick and then I decided it on that spot all day and I got five bites that day and I fish clean Landing them all but yeah, five bites and I know about 95 inches. How long did that take you to get that Linda took me all day. I think I got the last ones out. Go maybe wow, that's crazy. So what was so special about that spot it held Big Fish. There's a big fish sitting on that spot. I marked them but they're they're kind of scattered, you know, so and but there were certain little sweet spots on there. And when I when I can get on them, right and I could feel when I was on him, right? I knew I was gonna get get bit but it was with the wind and everything else. Sometimes it was hard to get on it. Right, but when I made that cast I could I could feel I was probably gonna get bit. Yeah, I literally as you're talking I'm like just remembering old trips out there. And I know exactly what you're talking about is like like I'm living a reliving the moment with you, right? I want to get out there man. That sounds like a blast. Oh, yeah. Yeah. I was catching on a big football jig 3/4 ounce. That's one of my favorite ways to catch em, man. Yeah. I'll see your fun. Mmm. I was what's up? Like Legends or what? Just I rode bad that bridge came up to about 15. I think it was. Yeah. Yeah 19 to 21 foot spa. Yeah. It's pretty deep. Yeah. It's crazy. Right? What is brave? Oh gosh. I was trying to remember is probably almost what five not quite five miles from the ramp to that Spa like, oh, no it was yeah probably two and a half maybe from the ramp. We launched that got you. Yeah, so it sounds like you know this exact spot then me. Yeah, there's not much on that. Like, I don't know that's another super fun that I couldn't fish it out. I was surprised when I nobody else showed up on that spot. I was I was pretty sure somebody was gonna be there especially with that. We had sellers on a 25 boat tournament out of the cold side on Sunday and I thought for sure some of those guys know I thought for sure some of those guys were gonna be on it and I left the spot twice because that second day. I had a lot a lot hers. I'm I fished shallow first trying to get on top water bite just caught a bunch of small ones that didn't help and and I said, To go hit that spot kind of 19 and a half and I sat on it for till noon and didn't really have that's all I had was that one fish. So I made a decision to go. I came came down and looked at the spot and I'm us all boat pull on it and they sat there for about 10 minutes and left and I went up past it and went on to this Creek that I've found in practice that I was pretty sure I'll be able to get a lemon in and watch them. About as I was leaving pull up on it and they can to stay long and 15 minutes probably took me that long to get out there and they were gone by the time I got to where I wanted to fish. So I pull back in that Creek and started throwing a white spinnerbait and I caught a 1414 of quarter 15 and a half and a 16 and a half on about 40 minutes or so, and I was able to as soon as I got my my limit I turned around and left and headed straight back to that road bed and it was my best chance of Cole and I was able to catch a 21 and a half and a 17 in the last hour and a half just sit sit on that road bed and pulled out those 14 s ended up with 89 three quarters for the day. Nice when they were they on bottom or we feel like they were suspended just out there were some big fish suspended that word just hammering shad and I could not get them to eat only ones. I get to eat with the ones on the bottom and yeah. in there when they're suspending like that just above man. It's so hard to Target those fish. Yeah, when that wind picked up at the end of the day on day two. I was pretty sure I was gonna be able to call because that's usually when they started sucking down the bottom for whatever reason then so that helped a lot and kind of got those fish down there on the bottom more active when that wind started blowing. Yeah. I was on a similar situation to situation at our Club Championship this weekend almost the a exact scenario, so It sounds like day two is a little bit tougher than day one. Oh, yeah, that's the stuff it was that way for everybody else. I figured it would be tougher because just because I'll hard the lake got hit up on day one. It's not a huge Lake and I mean even those boats I was pretty surprised Wednesday when I slept in that ramp and I woke up and there were had to be 20 Boat Trailers there in the parking lot by the time I woke up. I was like Wow and I was like, it's a brother and they were just beating the bank's all which is another reason why I decided deep. Yeah. And I need to learn how to sit still surprising. It's still surprising. You didn't have some company out there. But yeah, I was really surprised. What are they out on the points at all dragging the points or where they all dead right on the barrel. There was one point in particular that I'd Mark some fish on and there was a boat on it. Every time I went by both days. Yeah. Yeah, but yeah, there's one that first day when I was catching on pretty good. I had a bunch of boats around me on both sides and At one point, there's two on one side two on the other and I started looking and none of them were fishing. They were just watching me trying to figure out what I was doing out there think they're looking at each other with walkie-talkies. I think what else this guy's is kayak doing out here. He's crushing on always makes me happy. Yeah, so why are out there managed only big swimbaits know? No, it didn't I thought about it. I threw a little bit of a smaller one a little bit, but I can hang with it and that water is a little dirtier than I like throw swimbaits in any way so I wasn't pretty dirty. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. It's a rain early on just before the tournament, right? Yeah, I think so. Yeah, well in the wintertime man, that's that's where I learned to swim Bait fish. Oh, yeah there yeah throwing big big swing base and then fig guilds to like, you know, Matt lures and stuff like that. It's pretty nice pretty sick on the on the warm water side in the winter time. Yeah, but some Glide Bates might be fun out there, too. Yeah, they might work. There's there's some donkeys in that like yeah for all the listeners that aren't watching this video man. Sam's over here like to shut up now. There's not too many Secrets out there. Well, they won't be after this. Anyway, it's all good man without that 21 and a quarter. I bet that thing was 8 pounds. If it wasn't it was close to it. It was yeah so fat. I mean there's so much Shannon that laughs that's crazy. Oh, yeah the bait in that lake or just huge, you know, so they're feeding on just huge baitfish. So even even the white bass or massive in there. Yeah. Yeah. And then they have a full Year's worth of growing season 2 on the waters. All right, you know rights. And so yeah, you're getting that that Alabama, Florida Georgia, you know, South Carolina North Carolina type growing season and the Heart of the Midwest it's just and then they've managed it really really well. Yeah. That's real interesting and I've never been out to that lake. So I'm I'm kind of like my mind's kind of blown a little bit just like well, there's a lot of warm water lakes out there. But this one in particular just to set up perfectly to just breed big bass. Yeah. I bought a year license. Nah, I'll be back over there. Yeah, sounds good. Well, hey January 1st if anybody wants to meet up The weather's not awful. I'm down. Yeah, tell me about there. I think we should have a powder right you dope out there meet up at Berea had some good. Yeah. Well Brian's is quite a ways away. So all this yeah. Yeah, he's probably crying for hours and maybe because you know, he's Northern Illinois and this is this is east-central. I mean, yeah, so he's probably a little ways away but there's there's some cool places to stay out there. So yeah, I'm only four hours away here in Cincinnati. So yeah. Yeah, it seems like it's further than that. That's crazy. Right. I was pretty surprised if some like 6 hours from Chicago. Yeah, I'm 5 gotcha. Well, that's cool. So I guess we can get a little bit back in the day to since we kind of missed a few things. But did you notice like the pattern change it all from day one? It definitely got tougher. But then I Spent A Little More Time On Day 2 in the morning. Going for those shallow fish just the field on that top water. Yeah, just yeah because I didn't have time to stress out and I didn't really work out. I was pretty stressed all day. Yeah. That was another question. Can I ask you how you're feeling today one, but we kind of skipped over it. Yeah. Yeah, Ivo pretty good after day one, but I mean I knew how tough it was out there. And yeah, so I knew I was gonna have to grind to get it. That's why I was hoping Pull maybe one good one up Shallow, maybe feel a little better you kind of was hoping but I didn't really grow up go that way but his work out anyway. So that of those backup plans? Yeah. Oh, yeah. Those are important. Yeah, it's always first priority you get your limit before anything else. Mmm. I think I asked you your limit or how quick you had your limit on your second day. It took you all day right all day. All right. Yeah. Okay. So yeah. Yeah. Yeah, you were pretty stressed. I'd imagine and then Heck you probably had a lot of time to sit there and think about the leaderboards and watch them to while you're fishing stuff. I'd imagine no we didn't have leaderboards for this one. It was we brought our right that's what to the ramp and the first day. We had to go. We had to check in over the was a place called cabin. Some little Islands by right the cabin and so we just brought her pictures and and did it all there. So I didn't really know where I was outside of when I got to the ramp. I saw Dusty a cure there and it's like it's doing a good he's like, I'm not really good for this Lake and I was like, all right, then Todd. I talked to him on the phone. He knew talk Patrick knew that I had gotten pretty certain. He had said something about me having 94 and Dusty turns around goes you at 94 inches. I was like 95 And he was like damn it. That's cool. Yeah, I did forget that you guys did your check-ins and measuring at the at the ramp, but I think Brian was the one saying that you you almost ran out of time getting back on because that right. I stayed to the end so we had to To fill three to fish and then we had I think to lose it 3:45 to get back to the ramp. So II started going and I was pedaling as hard as I could but I'd use my torpedo a lot more that second day, so I didn't have a full battery. So I ran at full blast halfway back pedaling as hard as I could and then brought it back to halfway, so I didn't run out at all and went Helen was hard as I could the rest away and I made it back with six minutes to go. Ooh. Yeah, my torpedo battery was on the 0 when I got to the ramp, but it was still running. That's crazy. Yeah, what's your top speed with the motor full blast and pedaling as hard as you can man's probably Five and a half maybe close to Six. That's all you know be man. Yeah. Yeah. And you said yeah. Yeah, that's pretty good. Today gold bars pretty fast especially loaded down the way I have it. Oh God. Just getting ready to say that the big batteries and fifty pounds of soft Plastics and all kinds of stuff on the thing. 712 rods. Yeah, heck. Yeah. I only only carry for with me but I can't you know, I can't afford that many of them. I can't help it. Oh, yeah, I was saying people people say they know that bass fishing changes day to day but the changes hour to hour, you know, I mean, you just never know what you're going to have to throw so I like care of them with me and I don't like have to cut and retie if I can avoid it, you know, so. Yeah, I was way more time. Sometimes you just have to you. All right, so we're going to get into some other stuff here. Just so people can get to know you a little bit better. Is there somebody in the field of these tournaments that you're always looking for like like arrival, I guess type. I mean, yeah, who's your Rivals? Oh, man. Yeah, Christine Fisher's one. We're always up there together kind of switch back and forth Cody Melton's another one Josh Stewart as another one. Those guys are always up there. And if you throw tournament you could bet they're gonna catch himself. Yeah. They're they're the ones I'm always looking for it. Did you have these you just did you name off the Hobie team for 2020 just now helmets are for Cody if he can one want I'll be come with us. Yeah, I think that's in his backyard. So I think that's the player though, right? Yeah, isn't that yeah that the strategy right now. I don't think so. Cody gets forth a lot. He's really consistent. So, you know me Josh and Christine decided that we'll just go one two, three, Cody could have forums bottle roll down to him. There you go. That's who's buying drinks in that scenario afterwards is that Career. Oh, yeah, that's well, I guess it depends who takes first. Did you hear that? Did you have your eye on anybody in this Crossroads? Classic somebody that you wanted to be? Not really. No. No, I mean I heard about some guys that were good on the lake Patrick putti Tharp already is really good. So it was you know, Dusty accurate hers fish a lot stuff like that. So cool. And if I beat those guys, I probably had a good tournament. Anyway, yeah, right. So what was it like lodging with all these other guys from all these different trails? That was a lot of fun. I had a really good time. They some of the Wisconsin guys brought down some spotted cow. Oh, yeah, I've heard of that stuff. Yeah of when I was up in the cross the last couple of couple times last year. I got to know that beer. It's really good. We'll talk about it. I've never had it but for a lot of people talk about it to find out Baker talking to sleep. I'm not fishing actually built this he reveal all his Secrets or eyes and a mouth obviously, but I don't know. I just know he's talking he woke up the guy who was staying and on the couch too. It's like what is going on? Yeah. Hey, you know, so I don't know for sure but I think I think Oktoberfest might be going on up in Lacrosse week were there really I think I'm not sure if it could be I think it is. I think it is odd to check but they have a big Oktoberfest up there in the city of La Crosse every year. I feel like every time I've been there it was Oktoberfest. Well, I mean so for for people that don't know much about lacrosse it is a like Bruce city. That is I mean, that's what it is. On for is all the microbrews there. So but you know, it also depends on who you're hanging out with, you know, so you can have Oktoberfest any time of year if you really want so all right. Well Society has the biggest Oktoberfest outside of Germany actually, so I'm pretty familiar with it. Okay. I didn't know that that's good to know. When when is that? When does that go down? October yeah, yeah. I'm not even sure. I've been out of town a lot lately and start drinking on October 1st. And you know, see how long I can so do you have some kind of preparation or mental preparation you do for these tournaments? I try to put my time in with my maps. That's one thing not try not to take it too. Seriously because when I just I get really stressed out I fish poorly when I do that, so I've found I just try to relax, you know things seem to go a little better the first couple years. I did it. I was real strict I'd wake up at the crack of dawn every day in practice and you know all that type of stuff and She's not the way understand really work for me. So, you know, I just got to stressed out. So once I started relaxing and taking a little easier I started doing better. It seems like it's the that's a common theme with everybody we've talked to they're always like yeah, I just need to chill out. Yeah. It really helps them. Yeah. Yeah sleep in a little bit to on probably sleeping more one of the guys who really doesn't is Cody Melanie gets up. The crack of dawn every day and he's out there. Maybe I'll sleep in I figure if I could figure them out later those morning fish will be there. Yeah, like started catch them when that sun gets up. Yep. That's true. So I all right. We have a lot of listeners here at paddle and fin lot of new kayak listeners and I like to like get a lot get information out there for them to learn I guess and I'd like for you to run through your routine of submitting a fish to the leaderboard, okay? Well first I got to catch the fish after that. I'll lay them down in the in the bottom of the PA. So it doesn't really work for a lot of other kayaks because the PA has so much, you know floor space compared to a lot of them, but I lay it flat in there get the picture just to make sure I have something you know, oh just if it jumps off the board, you know, then then I've got something out of them then I'll lay Flat my lap on the board and I'll take the picture that way get the you know from the tail trying to get as much as I can out of them. and then I'll take usually five to fifty pictures of the fish. They can best one. I'll fix the best picture and I'll put a little little heart favorites favorite it on the iPhone. So what I have a little hard on there and then I'll I usually open a new folder and I'll I'll style and then I'll after I take the picture of the fish and I'm done. I'll do one two, three with my fingers once I catch over five then I turn around. Throw with my thumb and go the other way so I can tell him this, you know separation between fish. Yeah, it's a good idea then then at the end of the day, I'll go through off news of my favorites and I have all the best pictures for each fish in there. I'll move them to a new folder and I'll well I'll just go through pick out my top five and I'll move them to new folder and that I got them there to submit right? Yeah. See you don't submit right away. You wait till the very end of the day. It depends on how the what kind of fishings go. I'm Doing if I've got time if I'm fishing slower especially deep sometimes I'll submit fish. Yeah as I go. If if it's something I feel like I could cast right back in there and catch another one or whatever then I'll try to get it done as quick as I can and you know, we're worried about submitting them to later but it's not like Sting. Yeah, I've been accused of sandbagging a lot lately, but I never really used to do that. It was just just kind of the way it's worked out lately. Yeah, I wouldn't worry too much about this. Those guys saying that man it's all good part of the game. Yeah. So what's your plans for the rest of the year? I got two tournaments left going to the cross for the kbf championship and that I've got the Tournament of Champions down and watch it. Aah. Oh, yeah, I forgot about that and I cool got man. That's the stack feel too. Oh, yeah the Champions. It's real unreal. Really? Yeah. It's basically a national championship want to look like a smaller scale. So yeah, there's really has its they took all the winners from the satellites and the top six from every open and then turn out to be stacked field. It's going to be a very tough tournament to win anybody ones. That is gonna earn it. Yeah. Now one's going to be real fun to watch and recap. Yeah. It's gonna be it's gonna be interesting. Yeah. So play it plans for next year. What do you got? What do you got to focus on? I really like the Hobie schedule actually myo is actually who I was representing at noon Lake from the crossroads and they have pretty good schedule to summon try to hit some of those and I'm gonna go through and kind of pick and choose some KBS I think and look at the pro series and stuff. Try to work out a my schedule try to have a little bit of everything. It looks like the bringing Border City Classic back on Lake st. Clair. So I'm gonna try to make sure I'm up there for that. Nice can't miss it. Right. It's like letters been too good to me. I can't be missing any tournaments up there. Yeah, I think I remember her here in another interview with you. You started Muskie fishing in the middle of a tournament or something. All right. Yeah blows the it was in practice. But yeah, okay. Yeah. I had them out. Um dialed in pretty good. So Christine is a Big Muskie fisherman. She's talking about going I was like, let's go. I'm ready. She's like, well, you know, nobody catches on the Timeout I'm like, let's go. It's all right, once we get out there and I think hit like a ton of bricks, but I didn't have a Musky that so I got them in my yak attack. That and it's you know Tails hanging out. I'm just holding both sides of it. Like Cuisine was like are you serious? It was good time and some fun and then everyone ended up going I want to and that tournament to after yep. Obviously, we're pretty comfortable with what we're on. Yep. I remember we captain that one. I was pretty impressed with that was fun. Yeah. Well Cool man on fire this year. Yeah. She is. Yeah. It's impressive. There's like I mean, geez, he's always someone that was in the conversation anyway, but now it's like yeah, she's an amazing year. You just expect that. She's gonna be there. Yeah. Yeah. She's tough to beat. Oh cool. I think that's all we have tonight. Let's have said no man, you don't already follow you feel free to shout out your socials and hit up any sponsors and want to thank or anything like that. Yeah, yak attack would be one tell you that that Landing that's been amazing for me if it's a what if I don't have that didn't float. I wouldn't happen that most of the time because I've dropped that thing in the water Ohad specially landed fish, you know when you get get those fish going coming in and they turn around and just dive back down. You got to let go of that net and try to bring them back in so I don't have to worry about a thing, sir. In the bottom, that's a big help. Yeah fishing on lines another good sponsor mine and they've got a new line of tungsten out. That's really cheap and I've been using all year. So it's not actually cheap. It's just the cheapest honks and I've seen yeah, you know, it's not cheap stuff. So it works really well and angler is another one there the they have an app where you had a waypoint and you can it'll show up on the a app so you can track your whole day. It'll give you some extra information barometric pressure and stuff for when you catch a fish calcoast mix a lot of good stuff donkey Lucia use a lot their battle box is awesome. Lawrence is another one that Elite 9 is awesome. I've got the live transducer yet, but it's it's pretty sweet. Yeah, I'm looking to upgrade to that. I got the hook to right now, but I want to go to the Elite 9 for next year. All right. Yeah, it's it's a huge step up. Its the biggest difference for that is the sides game clown minutes. Yeah. I didn't even like using the side scan on my ti to be honest. But yeah, it's night and day difference with this and always run a point one with it. If you know, I don't know if anybody listen in uses the ranch and doesn't have a point one at the big mistake, especially if you're trying to fish deeper stuff because you know exactly where that way point is makes a big difference. So yeah the bomb anchors just got on with them. They got they make a pretty cool. Anchor be worth going checking out if you're looking to put an anchor on your kayak. Yeah, cool new product there for sure. All right and Torpedoes been pretty good to me. That's that's changes the game and change the way I pre fish, especially more than anything, you know, a lot of tournaments. I fish I'm not allowed to use it but I can still use it in free fishing and I could hit a lot more spots and do a lot more with that thing. So absolutely that's about it.

The Wisconsin Club Championship on Lake Waveland featured 14 kayakers and was won by 26-year-old Matt Hollenbush, who caught 17 fish over the three-day event, reports the Wausau Daily Herald. It was the second win of the year for Hollenbush, who also won the kayak championship last year. ""It's a great way to end the year,"" he says. ""It's a good way to end the summer."" The Daily Herald notes that the weather on Waveland was ""very tough,"" with ""multiple weather changes"" over the course of the day. ""I fished with inside a gym all day and ... we got to chat a little on the water,"" Hollenbush says. ""It was a good tournament.""",0.1176470588235294,0.0784313725490196

Welcome to a new year with the MMO s.com podcast Episode 205 and I'll die here. Join this year by Remo and there it is this year all time 20 20 20 20 and there are still no good and most apply. Uh still well, here's the question. Or will this be a clear year for a more fiji's 20/20 vision? Listen, hahaha. So we did there with 20/20. I do think there's more hope this year than other years. I didn't wanna jump pretty quickly to our game of the year section because we did mention a few upcoming is ripe for and what was good this last year what not, but I think everybody's over and my friend mentioned something to me and it kind of made me think we feel really old and we're talking to pregame about getting old and we're not that old. You know you 31 I'm 30 and my buddy. He's a he's 30 as well. He mentioned I do you think We're going to be like top 1% in a game again unlimited think know who feels bad. Like it's like I was really good at League. I was really good at Starcraft 2. I was really good like and a lot of games I did even though to back when I first met I would say they cannot stop bumper setback never did it to maybe like top to 3% But nowadays it's the last game. I was top one percent at was probably still League of Legends. It's kind of hard to kind of combine and moves into it because like, yeah, you can find like you're a raid parses you could 99. Parsons certain fights, but like if you're not like if you're not that person everything I guess I would consider the top one percent but Emma was a kind of like a different beast and you really just optimizing at that point. I think it's look at 99 in 2014, but that's not really a good Benchmark. So to me I do see it kind of difficult kind of visualize myself being top one percent and like any competitive game again, you know, I feel like we're getting old or a reflex or dying. I think we're getting all definitely but as I think there's a bigger Trend to and that's a trend of the scope of the gaming industry. Like like when we were growing up right ten eleven twelve how many It's where they're playing even like DOTA 1 even like Smash Brothers Melee at that time. Nobody like very few because especially competitively because the logistics weren't there and even there was a million globally right now would like Fortnight. There's like a hundred million people playing for a night. So to beat 1% of her night, you got to like crazy with your you know, with the building, you know, like even even like we think about like when were playing SNES, you know growing up. Well, there's Mega Man X or knockout country compared Donkey Kong Country or thigh or Mega Man X right on the SNES. So any like new age Nintendo switch like Mario Kart switch or the game literally plays itself for you. I did like Mario Karts which has a default autopilot mode on where you can hold a and you close your eyes, you will go through the entire stage successful. Okay, you couldn't do that back in like any old school SNES game these games were more hardcore. So I guess if you are able to play Donkey Kong Country or Mega Man X. You were like probably top one percent by today's standard. So if you look at it that way I think gave me was just a smaller Niche so because the thing because well, here's the thing. Here's some problematic. To your buggy keeping right the the difficulty of games itself was gatekeeping, right? If you're afraid of your family bought you one of these Platformers when you were like 10, and you couldn't beat the first level you probably got turned off from gaming, you know. But is it possible that I could probably still be top? 1% a game like TFT or you know, though down the Lord stuff like that because that's more game knowledge where reflexes aren't as important the way there are some your maybe people will be hard times like that. Do I feel like I've never really been committed to Hearthstone already ccg. I played a lot of Shadow verse and hurt somebody and not enough to like really, you know be good at those games, you know, but I think we have three capture that sense of competition locally. One of the great things about those older style games like where Fighting games arcade or like early councils is you don't have to be the best in the world. If you were just kind of competing with your own like your own school grade, right or like, you know friend group that was enough for a sense of competition a sense of success as a sense of like a pecking order. So I think hopefully I kind of I kind of wanted to go more in that direction rather than just trying to compete with some kids in China who play 18 hours a day, you know, but do you think like the current like trend of matchmaking and online games have I kind of made kids like lose self-esteem? Like there was always a kid was like, oh, yeah. I'm the best. I've never lost a game of like Mortal Kombat. I've never lost a game of like Smash Brothers and like at that point back then like there was no online play for these games. You just played locally and he that kids probably not lying. So he was in his mind. He was a really good right? He might if I was like the best ever right, but because there was no online play too kind of like smoosh you and let you realize how shitty you actually are like people felt good about themselves, but now with online play nobody feels good about themselves. Everybody knows there's somebody better than that like every knows there's always somebody better than them. But back, then you could pretend like you're I am undefeated. I play Bowser. I don't know how to do anything in melee by be all my friends with suck and we put it items only that's how we that's how we rolled it. But that's a good point ever thought of that. But so I think I really do matchmaking is an engine for frustration. But yes, that's interesting is you point even if you were not good there was literally the case that in your friend group, you would win ninety percent of matches, right? You still lose some but 90% that you would win but online if you match making everybody wouldn't exactly 50.1% recognize you Better it puts your gets better people so you can never win more than 50% of your games. So you never get to feel like you're achieved anything because you never get to feel like okay, I'm good. I can relax because it's always it's always a Razors Edge your next match making match. That's a good point. Maybe that's why life will get you know, pretty toxic on games. Like we can know that we're because you're always winning like about 50% and I feel like you kind of know that it's designed that way but then it makes it makes the law streak feel exceptionally bad. Well, if you lose like six games in a row and you oh my God, I felt so far I was supposed to 50% but I didn't am I horrible what's going on? Let's try teammates if those guys you know, like if it does create engine of frustration and interesting way it's obviously unattended mechanic, but I still think it's still a net positive I think because it has to be that positive. Otherwise every game company in the world wouldn't do it. Just easier to make a game online than the coop. You know, I think nobody's cracked the code of making Co-op a local local competitive popular, you know, there's a few companies we talked about in the past like Super League Gaming and stuff trying to organize small local tournaments for certain game. Eames I know even the local Dave and Buster's clone. What's it called game shops only the trying to do like local Esports tournaments. Mmm, but somehow somehow they haven't really caught the Zeitgeist. It's true. Everything is kind of defaults to like this matchmaking. Now, you know, you always competing against people online though. I would say Nintendo still kind of has that like that couch gaming feel of other titles only because Nintendo online just tends to suck ass, you know, not by like I'm sure they wanted to go messing around and they do have matchmaking smash, but just all line is always frustrating with end of titles. And play with your friends online is frustrating to because of the friend codes, but just until I get hot mess playing online in general so that came they came still gets a lot of catch boy. I'm curious if anyone has had has had this experience where what? I feel like when I'm climbing matchmaking. It's always adrenaline never dopamine. Yeah, but if I'm playing like smash I get invited to someone's house with eight people they all take to basically it's me facing them one by one and I keep winning but it easy. It's fun for them where there's looting stomped every game. Well, here's the thing though. At least I'm having fun in the matchmaking. He's having fun. Everyone is an adrenaline everyone on adrenaline 2014 the whole match and if they win it's because it was this close and then the next match they try they have to be focused again, it's always a Razors Edge. It's never like a stomp. So I don't know other did you do any proposed solutions for the matchmaking conundrum? Like it just seemed like that is mathematically speaking matchmaking solves a problem with like different skill balances and does a mathematically good job of doing that by giving you 50 50 games which like you said though. They do end up being a on the razor's Edge and they become all adrenaline. Stressful no chance to relax. This could be a test at a big company like Rekha do make it so one out of like 50 Games 1 or 20 games. One person the match is vastly over class to everyone else but the deep but the game is to tell you this so that was stopped. He got to stop that game and he so at least and then they measure this so he is now his dopamine whereas everyone has adrenaline, but you kind of naturally get that don't you apply from just like having enough 50 50 games for one guy gets ahead. He Stomps. Anyway, I tell you we kind of kept that on and automatically know but most won't make it like I'm you know is what what the result would be if they just put you in our like in a playpen with kids and just get to smash them how well the do for your you know, desire to keep The game will make up front 20 bad games. You had another promise those other nine guys. I have a horrible experience getting awful stomp or Five Guys on your team of four more asymmetrical games. So this could not happen only would you have to be a new game but you know things like was again called the one with the one guy's a monster and for people at survivors, it's big on the five days to die for days to die. Yeah, and we talked about forgot to name the dead by daylight then ideally dead by daylight so dead by day like Do you have an asymmetrical game where people get to take to evolve is also known as a similar one where you know one guy got to be overpowered compared to anyone another guy's gotta like in a work together to overpower. So at least everyone gets a feeling of power and the feeling of you know, helplessness and it kind of rotates. Maybe that's what gunbound was trying to figure out when you played random and you got the nose. Remember this come about example could only place combined anymore or everybody remembers it but we played random and gunbound you get a random character and like there was 200 P characters. You can only get by random a very low chance you get dragon of he got a night or something. Good night, if you got either those get a huge Advantage, so I guess it kind of play with that idea. We random chance to be happy. Actually, you know MMOs are uniquely situated to bring it back to the most. Thank you Durfee, but I think I'm RPGs are uniquely situated to test these asymmetrical Power Systems where you could have like the top player, you know be a lot of old Korean gives it this where what top player could be like the king and he could control a giant Avatar but then everyone else has a mob or something, you know, so they could be a lot of ways to play with it. And I think in the end it will slowly have to do this after people can kind of get tired at this, you know, 50% grind matchmaking stuff, but that's the thing about no mo. Versus more like Competitive Gaming right thing and most of the sweet spot where it's not like a matchmaking South Competitive Gaming where instead it is very asymmetrical accelerated in some team comps some raids. If you blink a pug group in ff14 or wow, for example, you will get certain players at carry other players and like you do feel good when you care other players, you always feel good. Like you looking your damage charge these scrubs hitting like 6K damage on a black mage. I'm eating like 12 can't come on. This guy really knows how to play. I'm going to carry him and you feel good being the bad ass, you know, yeah, so he's eating Hotel. A to make everyone everywhere has have a chance to feel like the bad ass once in a while. Hmm But that's the thing it beauty of him was it they're not competitive in the same way, you know League kind of strike don't know what not are so if you like you could still kind of achieve this through other, you know other avenues in MMOs. Yeah, it's all about this before but a few games achieve this by accident. So games like Counter-Strike with this crazy headshot. Mechanic Right One In A Hundred matches. You'll have the bad player just basically spray walk forward and kill the whole team, you know, like the whole enemy team just off five spreadsheet that and a guy feels great for the next, you know, 50 rounds of losing that's what the argument that the orangey of like the spray patterns and being generally unpredictable makes those mechanisms possible. You could have like a five best csgo players and one like awful. Just one in a billion games the one-off a player could could theoretically Ace the five best. Yes, go players. Yes players in the world by literally closing his eyes and just mashing the soup on do you get absolutely lucky but that can never happen in a game like chess or any game without RNG. It's a little bit would never happen on this guy. Just throws game attention Okay, so is it isn't it? Maybe was course we can tackle next time. I'm gonna think about it. How many people playing league right or Dota or Counter-Strike are going into it with the chest mindset versus the play mindset so I know you are. The more competitive and player when you qu for for League you viewed as a basically a chess match like in terms of like I play whatever game you play to win, right? Whereas I think a lot of people the majority of people play to play like they just knocking things down killing stuff you're trying new moves or you know, just do shit in the game at that's fun for them right with the oh no with winning being preferable obviously, but it's not being the dolia matters. I think for most of the playing ranked and people are very rank stresses of real thing. I it just seems like most people are going into it just to win games. It's about going into it just to win games you'd be playing, you know normal motor on Ray. All right. Well, yeah, I'm curious about that. Hmm. Did you want you want to talk about that League AFK thing? I want to hit our game of the year thing. That's it. Lets it the game of the year award first. Alright, it's a beginning of 2020 the most highly watched Game of the Year Awards in the world. Alright, I am most.com. All right, there was a bidding war for the Game of the Year this year. Okay, we had we had a blizzard. We had Square Enix just begging to give us money to make them number one, which obviously I'm kidding they weren't but while classic took the number one shot over here, and I don't think It could be underestimated how big of a game like classic is. Yeah, and honestly, I'm kind of relieved that while classic came out this year because the rest of the field like member we only give our game of the year two games that came out this year. It's not improve games, you know, just this year. So the competition was very very sparse here Estella online a few, you know, no name and where he I feel I would feel dirty giving it to us Talia like you win by default because they're like, no other game is launched in 2019, like no other PC and more peaches really launched in 2019. So it I would feel dirty even to study. So even though wow classic is kind of a relaunch it squeak by we gave it to them. Yeah, and what surprised me was how big the launch was so all right over there if they won and we had all the same problems you have in a huge new launch, you know in the past where they had opened more service and they thought they were 12 our cues to get in. You know, those 12 are cues lesser like a month. All right. It's like you always had to stay logged in if you want to keep playing. They give free transfers to new servers. But if you want to plan your initial Choice there was there were queues for you know weeks remember the server's launched initially which only called charting which is multiple copies of the whole world in each server and they call they collapse those now they're gone now, so there's only one instance of the world each thing, but they clearly were ready for a big influx and they got an even bigger one than expected. So it shows you that people well classic is on a meme. It's still going still big. I see a lot of people still playing and yeah and Beyond The numbers I just recap the quick numbers real quick on the fund and Activision Blizzard earnings report. They clarified that with the launch of our classic. Wow, had the single biggest increase in quarterly users and subscribers in the game's history the law joão classic increase subscribers more than any other quarter in the game's history. So they've added millions of subscribers because of our Classics launched that that was a huge boost the game's popularity and besides the actual data all that have some anecdotal evidence is just fun story as well. You know, when the game launched when my buddies quit his job Basically pretty well class of all that he prepared. He quit his job is ready to go the moment the game launched. He never stopped blank. I asked for his / playtime. He's got like four level 6. He's now three or four levels sixties and he's been you know rating hardcore video. Obviously one of them. I think the game watched it was it like September 1st or they August right? Yeah, and he basically has like if the case went out for like 70 days, he has like 45 days of in gameplay time, like literally non-stop playing since the game launched and my other buddy who's playing with him I play with him as well for a bit. He was jealous because he had a he had a job. Right, and he was like since wow classic launch team made a commitment. I am going to get fired from my job so I can play with class called a because if he gets fired he clicks on employee benefits if he quits on his own, he doesn't get unemployment benefits. So he was trying to get fired for like months right and and they just wouldn't fire him. So he just got so mad and just quit it. You know what Battlegrounds came out? I don't want to get fired anymore. It's taking too long. They won't fire me these guys suck and he quit his job when Bee Gees came out for while classic so he forfeit his unemployment benefit just to play while class right he was Trying to get fired you're begging to get fires. Are you play? Well all day but now his wish was granted. He quit his own job. So you think it's benefits by he's playing well classic all day and every day so it's a remarkable. It is insanity, but it shows you the power of World of Warcraft and how how addictive a truly good game can be I think honestly, I'm jealous. I'm envious of my two friends are playing more classy this much because it's been a while since I've had this hit where like I have to be like being able to sit down in front of PC if my computer Her and just play a game and not realizing 12 hours have passed. I miss that feeling fortunately for me. I think I've had you know more recently than you with various tiers of how bad he's working. Ray's coming out. I do get the like brief brief periods where I'll play like literally 16 hours a day and that realize 16 hours passed and it's a great feeling for some reason but it only lasts for me like about a week or two weeks before, you know, clear the content. I move on but that I miss that feeling and David having that feeling for months at a time. Obviously. I should have missed it. But I know there's a guy down the street called scats. Whoo. Some heroin. Okay. It'll try it'll give you right where you want right Honestly though. It is giguere addressed. I still get that feeling. There you go. It probably it don't think it's unfair to compare it like a drug it because it really is an interesting feeling where you can just literally play 16 hours. It's so amazing. Like I kind of look back at it. It really does feel like I was probably like on drugs or something because that that feeling of just like being so immersed in what I'm doing right where I'm forgetting to I eat well eat nothing all day. And before I go to sleep. I eat like I like seven Uncrustables or like like five Hot Pockets, right? That'll be my my dinner just like get sustenance for the next day. But it's it is it is a remarkable feeling and while classic is is firing on all Pistons. I think I had the Dave add a new service and players, you know, the Q times are gone. So if you want to play it's still Mega popular and you know, it's still doing really well. If you if you haven't even if you like it back into our classic, you know World of Warcraft others. It's a good time to do. So, I think wow classic success and the success of other progression servers MapleStory. I'm On guys MapleStory pre-big Bang official server is going to launch this year. That's my guess. They've already done experiments with you know, the lab servers. I think when you get a pre-big bang MapleStory server this year speaking MapleStory. First of all, they got to fix the client. I mean that the class but shit for it is like a 70% chance when you launch people story. It just doesn't open you got to keep trying that is unacceptable. I don't know what's going on with that, but I actually got I mean a new character guys level 200 before the end of the year. It's like a little ritual I have I been Basically make a new Burning character every holiday season and see how far I can get in like a week and every year it gets easier because it made the experience easier. So I did hit 200 my first 200 but doesn't mean the anymore because now the max is like 275. Hmm. But I was fun. I I still enjoyed playing MapleStory. Let's move on to our game of the year list. We have our best expansion the year. I really not too many contenders even made it to this but we gave it that 14 Shadow Bringers. I think as I think a lot of websites already did as well. In fact that the IGN gave like the best continuing game if F-14 chatter brings as well and a lot of other I think Shadow brick is one of the highest rated Final Fantasy games period in the longest time and this is a 5 out of 10 or something. So it's pretty universally liked I played through story. We talked about being immersed in the game when I was reading it for 49 to get that 14 hour 15 hour. Right, I do nothing but rate, right but whenever 14 shed Burgers came out, I'm playing MMORPG the more traditional sense where I'm just playing the game. I'm leveling up. I'm going through the story doing some dungeons. Like that was my experience had a brain is where I was playing non-stop. I beat the I faced the main story quests all the content Shadow Burns pretty much in the first the first week it came out. So I was playing all day for that first week and that was really fun as well. So I really enjoyed the game. I actually I've been trying to get Alta to play through Shadow broker just experience the story of an MMORPG. I do think it's the first expansion. In the game with a really good story, you know, I thought was better than Heavens heavensward at those a lot better in the base game story and a lot better than the there's the storm blood story. So I actually really like the storytelling of Shadow Bringers. I'm just kind of afraid that they're going to take it to a really bad Direction the future but of the wait-and-see for that. I think that's one of the crowning achievements of Final Fantasy XIV that they combined a good rate system housing Guild of these trading, you know Marketplace these MMORPG fee social features. They combine that with a traditional RPG sink basically single-player write the story basically single-player experience and it's and it's a pretty lengthy one. Right? Like how long does it take for my God human you character and growth in just just the main story quests 0 side quest. Let's say 1 the current expansion. And at least 30 hours, that's a that's a full-size game right there. Pretty much. Yeah, and we're saying you ignore all the side quests and there are million sides. Well you do I say do do as you hit him like you don't go out of your way, but you just but still again every map is designed to give you a million sidequest like you can really like what I've worked. This really was they do tell you the lure of the world like through optional side-quests. You won't know a lot of like my new shh about the game. If you don't do the side quest, right? Those are just there if you really want to like get encyclopedia knowledge of like starting events in the game starring character in the game how things unfolded and you really get That through the side quest but the main story quests like you said is basically single pair RPG. Yeah, and this game you have a fantasy has combined those two really well and they do it over and over again like every two years he spent in sell. Well, they grow the population keeps going up. So that's good. It's a healthy game. We're not going to get an extension this year, right? Because oh no, no, no. Yeah. So yeah, but uh, I think ff14 and ESO a really the only like big Western what ESO is Western developed. This is Japanese developed right here. The only two big like and more pge's in the west along with World of Warcraft. Obviously, these three games are really the big the big three OS old school RuneScape think I've been running for a long time as well as also super popular but doesn't have like the same, you know main story quests the main like jrpg style storytelling as a game like we're big story time the way ESO or fancy 14 does and this is an all-time high in popularity, you know, 514 brings reported like the highest ever quarterly earnings for that mode division, which obviously compared to certain like mobile game is still not a lot of money, but we still have a few games still thriving. In this environment where you know basically mobile games other like and mobas and battle royales are doing really well. We still have a handful of games being ff14 World of Warcraft old school RuneScape and ESO doing really well. And as far as wow, the classic did really well this year, but I think the the retail expansion did not age. Well, I mean people were excited the first month quickly kind of became disaster. The population went down and I think we've mentioned that very it's very possible that wow subscribers to actually dipped below final fantasies for a bit. But obviously with the launch of classic. I think it's great hundred percent with Wow classic there there Mulder much higher than 14, but I think there was one point where and if Think about how your number now that's move on to our most anticipated and this one is interesting because when I actually had a chance to play the alpha for tempt him just before the podcast. So most anticipated obviously it went to tempt him and this is after last year's going to Lost Ark so I think kind of lost our kind of dropped the ball because it came out with two years ago now in Korea and also all of them last year, it could have been out here too. But I think it just took too long and I've lost theme when other more viable products. I've been introduced like tempt him isn't you know string us along the alphas out. Its playable Weaver and I both played it and it's it works like a charm. It's smooth the graphics look great. It's bright vibrant and does it does exactly what it says it's going to do is basically, you know Pokémon clone. We've only played for about 30 minutes. Somebody asked is overrated. It's going to be launching with only like a handful of ten times in the game. So it's not gonna have like a crazy number of likes a crazy amount of content. They've already said that with the Early Access they can be launching with some pretty limited amount of content. So because of that like don't expect a full-blown, you know Pokemon MMO RPG just yet. But from what I've seen it more be really impressed. It runs really well. So the Early Access to gonna be locked with a 20-hour campaign with for boss. Tojo's which I guess would be like Jim's the game is Co-op. That there'll be semi 610 times to catch obviously not nearly not my kind of Benchmark was with a hundred fifty-four there is a Pokemon but you know, that's just with the Early Access. This customization is breeding system. The shiny tempt mspb battles and play of the world Explorer, but they can be adding a lot more when the game comes out and fully launches. They expect over a hundred sixty-one 10 p.m. You know, there's a pick and ban drank PV system and this game I was so impressed already just just the fluidity of the game and I launched the game. I start walking around. I see other players walking around the persistent, you know world of tempt him. In the actual battles themselves, they're really fluid and it's just a really it just feels good to play like a production value is there. You know, there's a there's a there's an unquantifiable element when you launch a new game either keyboard and mouse are controller and you just move you just you just got look you live left, right you walk a little and you can tell right away if it's got that smoothness or not, you know so many like indie games or clunky games just you could tough in the first five seconds at okay. It's one of those games like it might be fun. But you know, I kind of feel weird moving but I 10 times is not like that. It feels smooth right off the bat. So they go ahead and show this if the interesting thing when you make your character because in the Games character creator, you don't just pick a male or female the way you would do in any other a lot of other games. This is the first game I've seen where you just kind of chooses to male ish looking body or female is looking body and at the end instead of picking a gender you pick your pronoun. Yes, sir. I've never seen this before. I mean we kind of mean the batter for a while in the past, but this is the first time I'm seeing a guy so there's no mail jet in a female and once you're done with the character you can choose your Oh now she heard he him they them now obviously, I think a lot of people going to get kind of like a knee-jerk reaction to like, oh my God, that's you dummies are ruining gaming but like I thought about it for a second like who and I realized who cares like it's is this really hurting anyone's experience of the game and my answer is no I'll thank you, so you think no and here's the thing though. I would prefer you don't pick a gender or pronoun. Just make a character. Like what do they need this part? Oh, that's a good point. Maybe just leave it with the body because like you can choose a body beginning with like kind of, you know, you got boobs hanging. In out and then the broader shoulders is one the body types. So just choose a by type and then your product doesn't matter that and if you communicate yourself if you want in game going to choose your name, you know, like so if your name is Rima tables like hello remote a like what's up don't have to say hey him or hey, you know, like when would it come up and chat? I don't know add them. It is not a sponsor review. If we get paid to talk about any game we do this close it pretty openly we mentioned how much we get paid we talk about certain games, but I wish they paid me we do get a free copy of the game though. I've requested. It actually didn't give it to me. I know that. When I want you got the offer, you know, give me that hook up bro. I got the Hook-Up. So yeah, we only play for like 30 minutes early on but I was really impressed with this already just because like we've seen so many Kickstarter games like kind of flop and nothing came out of them. But this game is already kind of delivering what they wanted. Like, I've seen the battles already it very much feels like a poke Innovation Wise It's that really Innovative. It just took Pokemon and made a freedom and more version of it. So I could be free to play a launch. It's a cost money, but I'm surprised it tend to drop the ball this long I can see all those carrots. We got Brock in the and as I met Brock as my character seemed like a band, you're not gonna get been obviously. It's so funny to how much they copied the storybook him. I like it's not easy to copy the world like you kind of like you wake up in your mom's house and they go. Oh, you gotta talk to a professor. What's his name over there? You know, you're going to be leaving to become a Pokemon trainer or something and you leave your house you choose from one of three Pokémon. They always want to three and then you the Battle of in a battle your rival in this case. They're called Max. So like just just like the setup. Is so identical to the Trope and that the basics of Pokemon, which are these okay, that's not a big deal. They copied that but I'm just surprised it Nintendo didn't do anything quite like this on their own. I think Nintendo is one of those companies that needs competition to act. So I'm hoping we get more competition. I know this game called War Groove. It's kind of like it's kind of like Advance Wars but like fantasy it was really well received. So hopefully they make another Advance Wars game now, we'll see but I think I think Nintendo needs more people to clone them just so they can kind of Get off your lazy butt make you know better online games better quality games. My focal length sword and shield is they've Stick it to so much with that but they're not and I think tempted might give him the the heat they need to start working harder then see where Show gameplay video. I will talk a bit about a few of the differentiating things. I mean the games have player housing as well mention it launches which is which is pretty fun. But just the idea of like this persistent world Pokemon MMO where you battle other players and they can be adding pick and ban drank TP. I mean, this is gonna be a real Pokemon game in the beauty is Do a few design decisions that put you on doesn't do so, I liked your unlike the other video, but first to show that just show the gameplay. I will talk about the game actually is no RNG. So from their design perspective, they wanted to design a Pokémon like game without the RNG if you've played Pokémon before you know, that RNG is clearly a pretty big part of the game. It kind of influences a lot of decision-making in Pokemon. I mean, whether its accuracy and stuff like that, I mean there's a there's no accuracy in a intense and violent your hit space canal and every single time. He hits take a while to charge up. So they've kind of Solved the RNG mechanic by by adding a stamina mechanic the game. So if you want to use certain powerful abilities, you think it more stamina than other abilities, right and other abilities to use them. You cannot use extra tax at the beginning of a fight, you know, you have certain tasks available on the first turn and your second turn will start charging up and you only use after it's fully charged that point is charged with you can use it then and then start recharging up again and obviously more powerful text take longer to be able to use later in the fight as well as the require you to have use a more stamina if you use abilities, we add a stamina you take damage yourself, so Database we try to design the game around a hundred based skill and strategy rather than RNG which Pokemon is notorious for I mean, you could just lose a game to crits in Pokemon and and missing attack. You know, how many times have you know, if you play Pokemon Showdown you get a 10% profit or you miss a 90% attack, you know stuff like that is was clearly something tempt them didn't want to have so it's not just purely casual game as well the designers by attentive clearly thought about making something more more skill-based which is interesting considering their look and feel the game looks very much like on and looks very much like a casual game, but I think they're going for a pretty hardcore feel to them. They want to do is pick and ban rank system as well. So they're try to design their game around, you know, building a good team and making good good, you know try to predict your opponent's moves and whatnot. So if you're just in that they do talk about a bit of the design philosophy on there and there is no Kickstarter page. I'm trying their website as well. Yeah, I mean, it looks great at anything. Like I said earlier is going to be a competitor ranked competitive matchmaking to another my matchmaking but like a rank system. But it looks pretty intense again. I'll tell you I've only played red for the broadcast began. I think the alpha has just started last night as well as putting a chance to play it but I'm probably gonna play it later today as well and I'll folks funds in on Thursday. There's a few stress test from here until it the middle of the month and I think it should be coming on Early Access this month to yeah it decide this again that we put us, you know, most hyped games. That's actually coming out like this month last year again, we talked about Lost Ark and lost ark is still not out here in the west. My prediction is Lost Ark will launch in the west this year. That's my prediction. All the other we can happen, but it's got to happen because if it doesn't happen this year that I was all gone. Is he like blade stall over again where people were so high for Blade and Soul, but the launch took forever. Alright, so next moving on. Here we go hordes dot IO for most Innovative. So I have you seen this one. I've seen like I once again twitch play for like 10 minutes, but I didn't play it myself. I know you said you give it a try. Yeah. So this is It's online. So I don't knows IO sites just going to hold it out. I owe you can still make a character. There's two factions PVP open world PVP. It was Monsters levels. It's like a full feature MMORPG on any browser no download and it just works everything works. You can make parties you can you know, whatever it is drops is a PVE or just pee pee Repeat npv. Okay. Yeah. So this is a team-based PVP and it works it works very good. And I think it's smart that they jumped on this IO Trend because these IO games are huge, you know, all the kids play them at school and under under the iPads or whatever so great. It's I think it was a very nice little gem and I think it's I think it's maybe like two people one artist when one coder so it's amazing. It's very impressive that IO games. I only have played that a bad IO game yet, whether it's you know a gar. Our whether it's servio the put down the pub G like Battle Royale in the browser for there's hordes IO games it for whatever reason I've been very very good. So yeah, the guys are on a PC right now. You can just probably just check it out while you're watching maybe when people play it after the podcast and there's something to be said about just being able to launch a game and play it right away. You know, there's a buildup. Look when you play it up for Dean to begin, you know, quote playing ff14 because it's got that jrpg look and feel, you know, you're not really gonna be playing the game for at least an hour. Okay between just like introduction, you know walking around town like killing your first enemy, you know, it's being an hour before that happened. So with hordes I owe you just jump right in. Yeah, so that was last year. We gave it to a again that shut down like within a week, you know, it was like what was it called? It was like the one where it was kind of like Realm of the Mad God, but when you die, you keep like some traits that you get well, yeah that that was actually really cool game. I forget the name of it to now. Yeah, it's dead though. It died like within like a month ago. What's funny is think two years ago that we give it to another game to shut down. Already, that was the show that that year as well Masters, man. Yeah, so we gave them a strikes Master with shut down that year Survivor give it survived by which also shut down during that year and maybe I'll take maybe the curse of the mo is not kind of most Innovative award hordes that IO guys confirmed the shut down this year. All right, because what if we could have whatever we give our most Innovative game to just shuts down. Alright, well, we'll see. Miracles it was a both those games. I think we're really really impressive in terms like their design features, right? I guess work commercially viable, but I think at least Master x master a lot of made a lot of weird mistakes and like who they were aiming to cater with that game. So I'm hopefully hordes IO doesn't make that mistake. In the end best Battle Royale I can you believe it over that. Apex. Legends came out in 2019. I mean that one it just it is wins by default for that. Yeah. Well, I was a huge game. What else what else do we have in a couple of like me ones? Yeah some Duggars but Apec Legends kind of pulled off a pup G that in terms of it came out of nowhere, right? Like a peasant was like a total surprise to released by EA and respawn right? And it just it was huge. It just took off everyone was playing this game. It did slow down, you know a few months after launch, which is normal, but it's still a huge game qg sports team. Going around it. It's fluid. It's fast. It's good. It's Council NPC. It works pop G kind of suffer from like lag and hackers and cheaters and disconnects. I feel like everyone's way smoother Than The Punchy is but it feels nicer if we talked about with temp temp. So if you play puppet you today even today it's going to As you move around its gonna be like buggy and laggy and like you're going to feel conquered but we play by students first time smooth. I'm not sure clunk heard is a word all that but I like the way you use it though, because I feel like the width just sounds like you know, it is what it is Clunkers moving around and probably still doesn't feel does it feel right? You know what he launched publicly for the first time you invite a couple friends into your lobby. It seems like eats eggs appear in the background it just you just know it's not going to run. Well exactly. I wonder what the term is for this but there's some kind of unquantifiable feel like your games like smoothness Factor. Yeah, when you launch a game of the first time you run around you you get that right away. I knew from the get-go like the puppy was a fun game. I played a lot in beta if I Played it more like before launch probably than after it launched. It was a fun game, but you're always fighting with just the way the game felt. Policy was made for Windows 98. There you go. So I think last year we gave best battle royal to ring of Elysium, which was actually a growing game at that year, but I think it says that has kind of fallen off on Steam charts. You think what? Yeah, let's see. Yeah, it's free to play written by Ten Cent. It gives you nice spyware in the computer. But you know at the cost of progress, let's see ring obviously see ya deadly fell off. I mean last year was peaking at 63 thousand players on Steam. I have since Fallen quite a bit average has 4,100. Players now. Wow, it's it's Fallen quite a bit. Just huge fall. I think Apex allegedly took a lot of steam out of this one. Yeah, it looks like to launch in early 2018 that kind of correspond to that big fall off. That's crazy from 60,000 over 60,000 to now 2,000. So it just went a bit with a new battle relegating with Aaron big income that they really isn't that much room for number three or four player, you know and Wrigley's and was like, you know could be the number three player potentially after after 49 plus G. Right, but now you have a text editor to the firmly took that number three spot. Crazy don't make sense. All right. So that's that's Battle Royal, you know better world. What do you think of the genre? I think we all pretty high hopes for that. We're going to see a whole bunch of flood of these games and we say I think we have more of a trickle like there was a few big games a lot of really do games but I think really in the middle I'm disappointed honestly, very disappointed with us till the genre has been I feel you could be way better. I remember reading remember when pumps you first came out. They said they want to get em for like more players in a single map. Yes. We're still a hundred players in Pub GI. Come on. I hope like was really cool about battle relative. Wow, there's a hundred players and we got to see The last one standing why not two hundred players one of 300 players, like wait, why can't we do that? They'll be way more fun and intense just so much Upon Jesus spent like there's a balance between like running around picking up blue and fighting and I feel like when I'm playing pomp G so much time is spent not fighting. Yes, and if you just had more action, I think it's more fun and more rewarding if you with more than 100 players, I think most players prefer that as well. We need a good Battle Royale. It's maybe not a shooter. You have a few companies have tried that as well. But nothing has worked. I mean, what's it called - of creation apocalypse. There was like Nine Dragons one, right and Nine Dragons comfort me nothing. No one's played that game, except you and me. Alright, literally nobody but there are those actually bigger game that kind of went for the whole Battle Royale with without guns, but it also kind of flattered Did this is another one in development forgot the name of it. I get emails about it once in a while, but they're trying to make a non-shooter not FPS Maplestory 2 had a battle. Royale. That's right. So did Black Desert like desert? Yes building permit might be doing a little break. That's the one it's TJ. Thanks. Mei Li play the call to battle royal enjoy it as well. Battle right rip out. All right, though. The game is pretty dead right now. What was the paladins one called over the pedals Battle Royale those kind of big for like a hot rubber rail realm Royale was big for like a month and then I bet it's dead now. I think it said to you but no no I think was making a bit of a comeback. Last time I checked on Steam charge. Let's take a look. Let's take a look. I enjoy drummer. I thought we were popular it is. Yeah. Yeah. It's been a quiet now. It's been it's been it's been dying. It's down to I mean it really just stabilize probably begin this year kinder. I can't have from January till this January. Yeah, I don't know the bleed is I think it's kind of stopped bleeding lately. All right, it's never had that big again that I got a hundred thousand. Yeah. We'll see. I don't know. I don't know. We'll see it doesn't look good not looking good boys not looking good. Hit that hit that worst one all-time most disappointing. I lost my Spoilers, it's Anthem. See how both disappointing as Anthem. That's right. Yeah, not to what is to be said about that one. I'm everyone's already talked about this for a while. Well, yeah, there's one thing to be said about this. All right. EA has other divisions, right? Why do they keep tasking BioWare which is like the king of our single-player RPGs. Why do they keep asking them with these online only games, you know, like point right? Just get get one of your other Millions to you know, they bought yeah. I actually bought an MMORPG Studio the one that made Fuck Mythic Mythic, right? So within the close it whatever but clearly they have other divisions that could make online games. Why are they task and get to the guys known for these isometric D&D RPGs? Right? And I don't know so it's crazy and it's in a very strange thing like you said because their Arc like Paradox for example is where room very well known for making their grand strategy games, right and to keep making the same kind of game. They're really good at making let by where make the games are good at making don't distract them with this online, you know and-moe Style. Among Anthem. It just it is very strange. Now you have other Studios for that. Like you said, you know 476 was also you know, that was was up there for most disappointing. But the thing is at least at for whatever reason there are some people playing Fallout 76 still whereas Anthem is just basically dropped off the face of the Earth. Me did you put the bug zone 5 times 6 or pretty notorious? I'm sure you've seen internist or and videos. Yes, and you haven't seen those well worth checking out. These other videos do like all the disastrous launch of that game. And how many problems that had there's actually more recent book with Fallout 76. You can actually walk up to people and just Loop their inventory. Nice that seems like a pretty game breaking bugs has it happened in a non like indie game, you know, if it's an indie game with one developer. Yeah makes sense, you know. Yikes. What a great. Buck. Yeah. Nice. There's some funny YouTube videos of people like doing it and people going where's my stuff? Also in terms like what's coming up next also related Fallout times. He's kind of with you about New World outside. You think it's gonna succeed, you know, what's funny you're coming out, you know, it's actually an app is coming up with a totally reworked some big chunks of it. You know, here's the thing first. It was about going to the new world being America, right and then, you know fighting the natives and stuff, but then they got lash back from imperialism or like, you know, like some kind of white guilt stuff. I don't know like they literally just want to make a game where you know, you kind of reenact the Age of Exploration you come to America, but that they couldn't do that. Because of the PC police so instead there's like a magic Island now with like magic Roman legionnaires the skeleton Romans now it so I changed a lot of the setting these people and it seems that they moved away a little bit from the whole survival aspect. It's more like an RPG with like, you know, it's combat and normal Story. I mean additionally still crafting stuff too, but it does seem like they move the bit away from the original like yes, it's trust. Yeah. Yeah exactly. So it was a new world. This was back the frontier like America is settled America's but now it's just like a serve-out you just basically on his weird magic Island doing magic Quest and killing skeletons and the game's combat May 20 2014 Bucks on Steam and one of the big changes they made is that PVP now is opt in so you can't attack skill a shame that that's a drastic change from like your design philosophy were before it's more like rust where if you're wondering on outside town, you know anywhere you could just die. You know that that's what this whole point of Survival game. They took away PP from being, you know, anything goes Frontier to being opt-in which I think isn't this really a bad design decision because Obviously the hardcore, you know, the hardcore survival element doesn't have big audience, but it is such a drastic change from their initial like Vision, you know, it seems kind of strange that they decided to make a hardcore game and then the date the way the hardcore I'll mention later on but you know to their credit they flew a bunch of people in and they did a few Alphas faith in testing. So maybe this is a feedback that got back the people just didn't want to play what they had, you know, so I can't totally blame them for having to change. You know, I'm just always so worried when a game changes in that much. Can it really be good? Yeah, it's certainly possible. But I don't know. It makes me hesitant to really like jump into it, you know. Yeah, but I mean as long as it's free, I'll test it out. We'll see how it's not going to be forever. It's $40. It's $40. But here's the thing. If you how do you pre-ordered it when it was free would you could have done on amazon.com? I didn't bother because I thought if it's free who cares I'll do. I why pre-order I'll just get it when it's free. But so now cost money, but anybody who pre-ordered it gets it gets to have it for free. They got an email. Wow should have should have pre-ordered New World for free on Amazon ripperino. There you go. Huh? I mean I know cash you'll play it for quite a bit. He talked to me about it, but I'm not super optimistic. I hope it does. Well the only because I do want to see more and more is out there and they're clearly even if it's like this weird mix of MMORPG and survival and more like it could be interesting to do it. Well, so I'm always rooting for I think I like to think I'm an optimist even though we do kind of shit a lot of games on the podcast but I do always hope for the best like but even start citizen honest, I hope the game comes out and I hope they deliver like even half of they promised. I mean, there's no reason to root for someone's demise. You get the what's that word trend of food a have something like the German word? Yeah. We were both passing horribly wrong though. Like I really do wish Asher creation and starts engine come out because I do want to see a more thriving Amo atmosphere. No crowfall still not out Leo of we did this point like it feels like yeah, of course, it's not out dude that gives different come out. Stars what it is. It's a little bit of an update on Star Citizen. So with crytek is trying to pull suspend one of the counts as sewing for so one of the in the lawsuit one of them was so you start system one licensed one engine license, but they're making two games right Star Citizen and what it was it was the single player 1 Squadron 42, so they want to they want to suspend that one so they can because they don't think the game's gonna come out anytime soon Squadron. Alright this quarter The one that's actually to come out to single player game. Well crytek doesn't think it's gonna come out in the next few years. Otherwise, they would have not, you know suspended that one interesting note that this is a speculation based on lawsuit progress. We will see what that means actually. Hmm. And I said we got one more category here and that is Black Desert mobile as our mobile game of the year. Now. This wasn't exactly an exciting category for us. But with how big this MMORPG specifically are now on mobile we had to at least talk about it. There was actually a pretty big list of mobile images this year being Tales of wind Donna vials world of kings, but all of these are very generic names as you can probably tell at least Black Desert online. I feel like they kind of put together. The best package with the generic pieces of this job mobile shop, right? So it's not good. It's not any different than world of kings the little more polished right little more original in terms of like the visuals and worldly Kings looks like wow you just copied while so where I was like guys are at least a little bit of a unique aspect to it was perfect world mobile any good. It gives you a pop finish Ina, I downloaded and played it but it really just felt like I was auto-playing and I'd rather autoplay in Black Desert mobile. I was taught to playing in a peripheral mode perfect world mobile did a really cool RAR feature where you can Actually, like take your character in game and like superimpose it with the a are in that you living room if with the camera feature and looks really stupid but was really fun to play with I it was it was so dumb that it was fun and you can of course make you care to look absurd mean that's kind of like a signature staple a perfect world a you can make your character creation like ridiculous. So doing that with the a our camera was pretty fun in performance, but beyond that is the most fun. I've had you know in Paris Rome. Oh, I mean RuneScape Israel on mobile as well. So there you go. I probably first capable one our award last year for this category. There's nothing quite like it has come out this year fortunately. It's also like a real and more PG. No RuneScape Mobile versus you know, he's other auto play game. Oh, there's a little update on mobile here. So Tales of wind, which is a mobile Reggie. I think they actually launched a PC version recently. So if you want to check it out, but he was also really bad but usually check it out. If you want to play a bad game with hilariously bad voice acting. Yes, and I'll tiny plates like the first hour just like just a list of the voice acting it is so bad that it's funny. So read the story list of the voice acting you'll get a good laugh out of it and you understand an hour and you'll call it, you know a little fun little mini session of gaming over there, but it's so bad that it's fun. Also Chinese auto play pay-to-win nonsense game. So although we talked about we talked a little bit about old school RuneScape mariinsky about they did you hear about a bloodstone know, okay, there's a game called Bloodstone and it launched. I think just a couple days ago actually into free-to-play. It's a present. He's a Brazilian develop game. That's so thick with this game. You just get like a ski like 55 seconds the show the actual I gameplay for around there. It's available in both the English and Portuguese and it's it looks a lot like tibia and RuneScape. I mean, it's very clearly inspired by tibia. I know they love tibia and RuneScape down up down except the right just like tibia. Yeah, but it looks looks a little bit different but for some reason, I don't know why I actually I kind of like the graphics here. It makes me want to try this game. For some reason this this is more attractive to me. There's a lot of like more modern looking games. This was like some of the old Ultima games as well. Well, I think the era of remasters is upon us. So remasters remakes and spiritual successors of these old classic games with, you know, similar Graphics gameplay, but with a new engine so smooth and runs on Modern Hardware. I think that that's it. There's a bright future in that in that ditch me now Leo said, that's exactly what it looks now. I mean, you mean exactly exactly like a pretty sure it's supposed to be a different game. I don't think it just got out of the tibia private server. They don't think it is right. It's not billed as a tibia fracture isn't exactly. It's like It's super inspired. It's like tempt him I guess and yeah at but what anybody say more so because even though like the art style is probably a little bit different but here it looks like even visually like the exact same artstyle as tibia. By the game is available free to play on a bloodstone online if you guys are curious. And it's a lot better than like a poorly made 3 D MMORPG and I'm saying like yeah. Yes, exactly 100% There's some you know. Let's go you can you can judge a lot about Amanda autoplay. So I'm looking up as auto play in the background. We got the some beats. You can listen to on the right side. You got some Joe Rogan. You got some you have some Rudy from Elf Investments be another bad not a bad setup a little baby. I music. Well, I'm just reading stuff. Yeah, I'd be so embarrassed always show. What's on my autoplay, right? Oh, that's my stuff comes on there. Sometimes they're right, maybe maybe after hour after the podcast and we can think of There but that was no game. I think it's pretty cool actually do want to give a try and make your first look for it have that the first open a while because we have any real, you know, PCM more piece to cover but this just launched so I mean, I do want to go first and 4/10 him as well. They'll probably come first good. Hopefully 2020 some nice Games come out so I can play some good games. You know, it's been a it's been a dry. It's been a dry year in 2019. Well, we do have a you just say remasters. We do another game coming out this year that probably should have came out like five years ago, but it didn't Sega opened. Up there close bad sign ups North America for fancy Star online 2. It's actually going to happen here in the west. Finally, you know, this is a game. They had the website for coming soon forever and it is shut the website down thing last year. But now you know what they with the partnership with Microsoft PSO2 is going to happen. There's no other he's a firm release date just yet and I think this first closed beta was only for Xbox users, but there will be something for Windows 10 and PC launched this year. And you know, honestly, this is definitely one of the better of the of the instance dungeon person helped style games, you know, they really there's a whole lot of games like this. They get a whole lot of games like vindictus so worker closers, you know, it does a million games that follow this formula and this is one the few, you know, this one the few Japanese developed and more BG's. All right all those areas if this is a little bit too little too late though, how do you think it's definitely it's definitely late. All right for sure, but the Japanese version this game still popular. It's not very popular. Whoo. Good point numbness The Wanderer, he's saying Sega only now she's they can hold onto their entire stock price and block private server attempts. They don't actually want to release it, which is very strange because this game no, I don't think that's true because I think that being paid by Microsoft to bring it here. Yeah that too Microsoft wants explosives in North America so they can compete with his station also in psychos earnings report. Like I look at all these Japanese companies our knees presentations and reports and PSO2 is consistently listed was a top games for Every single quarter so this is probably the biggest moneymaker for Sega out of all their games. Wow, the PSO2 still makes tons of money for sex and it's only out of Japan. So the game is consistently popular and profitable in this homework of Japan which makes you wonder why it took this long to come out why they have to wait for Microsoft to bribe them to launch this game in the west like why I do it on their own. It's clearly a successful game. It is strange and I think you know someone who doesn't play Xbox whoever had an Xbox. I'm kind of grateful for Microsoft because you get cut off all day. Hello. No, no going on. We lost them. I'm here. I'm here. If you just lost me, yeah. Yeah, I just lost it for a second. All right. Anyway, Microsoft is actually doing this a lot of favors this year because of bringing us finished our online Cartwright Kart Racer and Crossfire. So a lot of these big Asian games are coming here because of Microsoft. You're out there. I'm going to I'm going to I'm going to challenge you right now. All right, who can let's take turn Japanese developed. MMORPGs. All right, I'm gonna go first a cheat and say Phantasy Star Online 2. Go twelve thousand fourteen. My way but I didn't hear you again like this course, but you know, you're not coming through on this Core Final Fantasy XIV when you say Final Fantasy XIV. All right uncharted waters online. Well, yeah, it's weird. You can't hear me I could now she all right. He's Fantasy XI. Okay, you you know you just cheating go I should say I should have said I have eleven I Dragon's Dogma online something in chat status. I stole from him. Okay Dragon Quest online. You got dragged Quest 1111. I drank West online are really right, isn't it? I don't know. We're drunk last night. Somebody help me out over here. Are these things called request online those requests love is a new one, which is usually called request online. Yeah, those requests X. Alright as Dragon Quest X. I'll tie it straight. All right Phantasy Star Online. Hmm. What is it? What's another one? Poof. We got the Square Enix ones. We got there really aren't that? Oh, I I got it. No, I can't hear you actually for talking. That's I can hear can't forgot the name. Forgot the name boys. They even have like an anime like opening the name. So if I didn't win I win no, no, hold on any one of the 10 seconds 10 9 8 and then closes Koreans and Marie 6 5 4 3 2 1 and what do you got goal that Megami tensei. Imagine online make a tent. Okay megaten booth. Let me see what I was thinking of him. Look it up all the crystal Japanese. I that's also Korean a lot of these ones are created when you guys are mentioning. Blue particle is Japanese. Its by Namco. I was thinking onigiri. Oh, I'll also do I get it to but those old words Japanese, isn't it? Is it I don't think it is it I think so I think so. I'm pretty sure it's Korean. I'm gonna check it. Developer lion game and they're Korean. I've almost started and the Wizardry online was Japanese. I met in the chap. I didn't think it was for some reason. I thought you had her pinned or saga. Yeah, there are so there are so many and more pee. What is wrong with our audio? I can't hear this game other launched in 2011 shut down 2014. I like it was a blip, you know, it had no impact none zero zilch. The checkout Pandora's I look at that you I'll tie this screenshot that we use is perfect for this game. We got this sui and my favorite part of the screen shot on the home page and that page is unregistered hypercam 2 that really captures the feel of 2011. All right amazing. No one's hurt. The beauty of these old resolutions is that you I was like half the screen or more mmm. Hey there, just really aren't that many Japanese developed a more pgs. They're on they're on the ball with mobile games, but just not a lot of you know, you know P CMOS. Let's SOG online. There's a bunch of other like yeah get ant Cosmic League from really weird games. They want to hear still around onigiri is also available on available on PC and console. That's guys we talked about earlier. I mean I'm ready for it. But it just seems like they change the game quite a bit since their original Vision that it is hard to imagine to come up good. So again, I'm hoping I'm hoping it goes well. I got a little funnel of story. All right, so ncsoft is a has read their logo. Okay. Let's see the new corporate logo. So here's a local boys. I don't like it. I've killed one better. It's so Bland, you know, they paid good money for this that you know, they like hired a design firm who like they said, oh this encompasses the culture of ncsoft. They don't get it connected, you know on a Cooperative company where design And this all come together. It's a window to the few clouds and bullshit aside. That's her. So here's what they said about this logo. Okay, guys, let's see how much I disagree with it's going to CEO Kim Tech gin the new CI represents quote craftsmanship enthusiasm and endless challenges furthermore. The sharp edges found on the new company logo was set to symbolize quote Cutting Edge technology with the letters and and see connecting to imply a connected World. Finally a new company tagline was announced window to the Future outlining NC soft. Eat to build towards the future. That's some corporate bullshit doesn't mean anything right? I did call the NSC being connected me some kind of Cooperative thing. Alright, I'm connected thing. You know, they wrote some BS exactly. I mean this is their bullshit but good for them. I did like kind of the role of a better this is this something that has no character. What's not a fan Who characters? Yeah. It's got no soul. All right. It's got nothing. I was all that and we talked earlier about potential as Delia being the Game of the Year by default by no competition, but the curb but the Korean version of study shut down this year. That's right. Yeah, so even you know, it's already shutting down. So I'm not that makes me kind of hesitant about the Western release the obviously said the Korean shutdown is going to affect us but you know when the games just sign in one market everyone's thinking Hmm Hmm. What's going on boys? It's shutting down to one market people in that Mark. You don't want to play it. You know the whole Market to not just any more cute. Yeah, so I just can't imagine it doing it's not a good sign when your game shuts down in his homework. It just it's automatic oof. Again, yeah, she's scars my estimate for lost our quest for for the come out probably late this year as my guest. We've had, you know smile gate announce some hires on their website for an English production manager or something. So they did work on English release and with the Russian release kind of rolling out. I think the next Market is going to be an a Honest, I think a lot of Dickinson blessed fives in terms of performance and in a celje. It was definitely better than blessed. Do you remember are? When's that happening That was supposed to be in beta like two years ago. Yeah, that never happened that that was a blessed 2.0 potentially the visuals of are looks so much like blast. Hey, I don't get why do they tease that trailer and then literally not launch the game and give us no updates in like two years. Now, what's happening how to how does this happen? It's amazing. I don't know. It's going to be so dated by the time it ever comes up. It's on unreal 3, it's already like two years late from when it was already an old game. It's just I'm not optimistic at what the weird part is like are like the Southeast Asian publisher. I forgot who it was they've released are in like some State and I closed beta like last year. But like that was it like it's making some weird launches other like Parts like in other areas why these going to happen calling, you know, what's gonna happen with there is nothing will happen for two years and then all of a sudden the game will not be playable anywhere until years, right and then all of a sudden game fours with his license. As they are is coming out in two months Italy some half-ass unfinished version, which is just what they did with no working on the fire to yeah just came out of nowhere. So something like that could happen. Is very strange. I'm still kind of Amsterdam. I'm kind of surprised that Kim on the fire to came out like that, too. I got some overview of numbers for the whole industry aren't for 20 1981. Take a look. Yeah, I love thinking to this industry number. All right. So let's look at this big old chart right here. Oh God. All right costly. I'm call it console games and mobile games are going to be growing. Everything else is going to be a shrinking its 2019 according to these dudes, which is New Zoo smartphone gaming was 46% which is smaller than what I thought but I think this dis NEW Zoo one counts physical sales still sorry. So this is still counting like the For just for Nintendo the PlayStations games you buy at GameStop. So this counting that keep that in mind. So we got 46% from mobile 30% Council and PCR boy is only a 24. our boy So nice mobile nine point nine percent year-over-year the most growth I think PCS I should shrinking. How does that make you guys feel another PC Gaming revenue shrinking? It's Embrace mobile. All right, I put a little bit of bra Stars this last week quite a bit of rock stars actually had some friends over and we went Ham on bra Stars last week. So there it is. I prefer super data's research. All right to do there is I think it's more interesting for the most part. I think I'm super dead stuff, too. The other twin 19 year in review I got check that out. Did you see that one might be an old one actually. I wrote down the numbers. I don't have the actual link to it though. So Fortnight May 1.8 billion a year according to stupid data. I'm I'm going to link you are the super data report take a look at it. All right. Look at the 2019 year-in-review sure. This is a It's a new one. I mean I can't they can't do a year in review without the year being over. So let's let's let's skip through this one together should be some fun industry data on this one. I got to open this way. They do one of these every year I do like these are free considering most of the super data industry reports are generally very expensive. All right. Well, that's true as well a kick a 55 is always a nominal revenues are growing not architecture. It doesn't matter. That's true. But I think actual revenues shrinking for PC. So it's not just market share. It's you know nominal Revenue. Let's take a look at this. So this one member superg data only looks at digital. So that's why consoles a lot smaller smaller here than it was another one because this is only counting digital sales on Console. That's still the one area where you know, it's Constable physical still exactly is still some physical going on consoles and mobile is sixty four point four billion versus digital PC like but a PC games are basically all digital. Anyway, when was the last time you bought a PC game in like Like a CD and installed it like never right? They do you remember the last time you did that but GameStop used have a PC section like literally died five years ago and they got rid of that five years ago. There's no more PC games like a physical format know there are yesterday dedicate doc. I am fine like the only time you'd ever use a series like maybe if you want to install Windows XP for the reason, otherwise yourself my USB anyway, Yikes. Yeah this I haven't you seen these in Forever, you know even physical game that kind of cheating now, like if you bought the Spyro game or the or the Crash Bandicoot Trilogy, you want a physical copy the disc that came with only had like one of the first stage on it. The rest has to be downloaded. Hmm. So it wasn't even like do you think it the full game on a disk now? Did you see how much money for night made in 2019? Yeah, 1.8 billion so you could try to change boys 1.8. Billy free-to-play gaming accounted for four out of every five dollars spent on digital games between 19. Thanks to mobile games. Number two here dungeon Fighter online 1.6 billion on our Kings 1.6 billion and League of Legends 1.5 billion. So guys dungeon Fighter online makes more money than legal Legends an amazing things that shitty mobile MOBA makes more money than League of Legends. It's insane legal Edge was before I firmly number one or two area. Yeah, but don't you fire a line guys is is the most popular free to play game. I'm curious this list includes Our World of Warcraft that we pretty much nothing, but these look at the These are the other can only free to play games that chart. The body playlist is not that exciting FIFA 19 made Center a six million apparently. While I was going down, but they said they had a huge uptake with. with the classic launch Pokemon go still made an insane amount of money. We want to go. One point four billion dollars. Is it amazing Pokemon go almost made us it might as a is League of Legends. Yeah insane. Yeah. I wish I wish this included World of Warcraft Revenue, but it's been really hard to get a good look at how much my World of Warcraft this make I mean glitches and pretty moan about it. And these industry reports have rarely spell Out World of Warcraft by itself, and they some of the old super data reports did have it to three years ago, but some really meaningful today. I just haven't seen a good number for World of Warcraft like this year. We're honest. Even like 548 specifically though. We'd have a good proxy for that by just looking at the entire Mo division for three nights and just pretending it's all fancy 14 2011 bunch of rounding error Dragon Quest online. Isn't that popular? You have missed a pinned area on CD. Nice. There you go. You got you you still have PC game scars. Me to master time. I still see people playing Pokemon go like in the wild when I go for a walk through on therefore. I see them play Pokemon go all the time. Yeah, it's not only is it alive? It's making one point four billion dollars a year since same. frequent order boys 1.2 billion the wife of collector a bunch of players people exactly a lot of kids still play it too. I mean I a kid who he prefers Pokemon go to the actual Pokemon switch games. He'd rather spend $40 on Google Play gift cards so we can fund his Pokemon go no currency and by the actual Pokemon game, I'm actually amazed how much money that games making it cheering. It's like it just seems like the monitor the monetization when it first came out of this was not like super gotcha style RNG, right? You call it, you know, it seemed like pretty pretty tame the monetization for that game and it still makes a lot of money which kind of goes to show if I guess you don't need to go super like predatory to make tons of money. It seems like that games monetization is fairly reasonable as far as mobile games go. Yeah Boy uncle is good for y'all to get you walking in and being outside unless you're done with that one cheat it like everybody used apparently so what do you think of of Candy Crush Saga making the same amount of money as legal Legends it's it's interesting that you know, these super casual games are so popular I'm not surprised honestly this is the playerbase just enormous in those games so I'll have you seen have you seen the Center Towers top worldwide Revenue 2019, let's see this one Have you even there? I've never even heard of coin Master know what the hell is coin messed everything else on this list have heard of it leads, right? But apparently coin Master is a top-tier Gameboys coin Master. Where's that me see that and then overall Revenue number nine. Number nine. We master. I see now Roblox made several million dollars in revenue on mobile. Roblox is absolutely killing it. I mean biggest gains among the kids are still Fortnight Roblox and Minecraft. Yeah. I feel like a lot of people every nose on my card. I feel like Roblox doesn't get the doesn't get like the for deserves. It doesn't get this credit. It deserves but they're killing it. You know, there's the game is huge. It's a on par with Minecraft probably like it close to it. Gets no respect doesn't give respect on the streets. All right it ought to so 2020. Where are we going to get any of these Kickstarter and more apt to be actually release time some of the classics like Paragon crowfall Park was really really Chronicles battery as you creation or citizen. No, no, honestly, none of those things are classified none zero zilch. Yeah, probably right? Yeah. No, we did say ask your creation did come out and say they're going to be doing their Alpha sometime in our 2020. That's for the that's the PCI, but I put the news on the most not coming. I'm still you know. I wanted to come out but I'm seeing how much our disaster Asher creation apocalypse was the game average like three players online now, so it's totally dead. They did come out and say you know Intrepid is Dick we're going to release Alpha One sometime in 2020 and they said that on January 1st, so they have until the end of the year. It's really some version of the Alfa and I don't think it's gonna be like a particularly, you know in depth or close to release version of the Alfa and it will not be under NDA. So whatever they do release you can everyone be able to see and I think I think 2020 will kind of collectible like people realize what this Alpha. Whether the game is going to happen or not. I think based on what we see with that Alpha we can write instantly write it off for now, but I've kind of already wrote it off in my own mind, but for some reason I'm still hoping to do a good job, and I won't buy one more thing real quick and maybe if you guys have more Into details you can actually read the full thing, but Star Citizen released a 20-18 financial post all bunch of numbers charts and all that if you look at their total income so you could chart right here. Every year right there going up. There's a bad shark. It's like black on black. But so every year the revenue has gone up pretty much none of you but like there this 2018 was our best year yet and I think 2019 is probably even higher than this. So people are still given the money and the dark with the Lubbock. The biggest chunk here is pledges. / you know, the big number you see on the crowdfunding. Yeah. So the making a ton of money still and I feel like they can keep this going for as long as people get the money. So I don't think it's a question for induction Revenue. For Star Citizen all-time high guys. They they have Peak subscribers in Star Citizen and it still didn't come out of me. There are people since 2013 there were oh yeah brought and monthly subscription Star Citizen. Yeah, man, I can't wait to comes out and you know, I can do all this shit and there's still subscribe. There are people that probably subscribe for six years Star Citizen and you're subscribed to like this game that didn't quite release yet. It's not a tech demo right now with like well like this this start fighting mode where you just kind of battle like the most off and the big promise to do. A cool stuff. I start system really haven't happened yet. Yeah, but I think it I think there's a set number of people that are going to keep giving them money. So I don't think gonna crash and burn this year. I think to keep going at the current pace. So now big update this year. I don't think chaos Shield the 30 months in a row you're late, but your message always always on time in my heart telling us that meat on this off at 14 to read more me not go. There it's remarkable that Star Citizen hit an all-time high in revenues. And the way this is going this there's no rush. There's no like guys we need to get this game out. Let's wrap it up. You know, no more new features. Nothing just make it happen. That's never gonna happen the revenue constantly flowing in so don't expect anything. I'm actually much progress on this front. By me they are putting to their credit. They are putting these statements out. I don't know how you know again, I didn't read the whole thing. I don't know how exactly this is, but they've a lot of a huge staff. So you look at the head count. They have 521 people on staff it 2018 dwarf knocks with this Tier 1 subscription much love. What you appreciate it? So we'll see if they can what happens here, but there is a lot of people boys. One day boys one day one day these these Kickstarter game is going to come out and that's another reason why I'm excited for temp temp. It was a Kickstarter announced game, but I could tell from the Kickstart. Whoa, like I was hesitant. I first heard of it, but I've watched a video my okay, like based on this video. They're showing me gameplay the show me real content. The most frustrating thing is you look at a Kickstarter and you see like character creation and I guy running around an empty feel like a guy running around at the field is not gameplay. That's literally default Unreal Engine. Just running around like anyone can install and religion today lot of some back at some like store-bought backgrounds and it's sure a character running around the forest or like some Fields. That's nothing but when I saw the UI the gameplay for tempting like whoa, this game is actually happening and they went from announcing that Kickstarter in 2019 to releasing their Early Access like this month. So they're moving really quickly and you could you can usually tell how far game actually is in process by looking at their Kickstarter and whatnot. And it's what's really remarkable for me though is I'll Take Em out and chain. Damn that release a single new Gameplay trailer for Camelot changes 2016. Do you know nothing? I did not know exactly though. So every time I cover Camelot Unchained in our in our news video, I look for new gameplay videos and official channel, right? The only way I can find is when the Dragon Con presentation of 2016. Now keeping you were using that one 2016 video like how have they not shown any new like real gameplay since then because the distance there's so little to show I guess and it is crazy and he'll when we start demos right? We're like excited because there were so many of these games in Kickstarter or like The expert mode and were like, oh Tim so many games to cover was so excited. But like literally none of them have launched. Yeah. So Legend of area came out that's what charge online is called now, and I don't think it's been doing well actually want free to play so you can try it on Steam, but I don't think it's doing particularly. Well, why don't you want I say it's worth trying only because it is different. It does feel a bit like Albion online to a degree but like less pupae moral Fraulein and they're doing dude. I don't want to call the game in a bit of but it kind of by default gets called in a bit of because like, it's really just a reclone of Ultima Online and old school RuneScape and that alone makes it different from so many other games. But then again you could just play old school RuneScape. You could just play, you know, ultimately private service and get the same experience. But for that reason I still recommend just trying it because it does feel different in other flavors of you know, Karina mortgages and what not and I said it is free now so it doesn't mean the reviews are quite mixed here. But remember the scene of went up and it's not available just on Steam as well. I mean most of the hard core fans have been playing the game off steam game launched. I've seen relatively recently or August 29th was released on Steam busting out in numerous betas off steam. Team. So plenty of people that actually really like the game of playing off steam as well. As numbers aren't as bad as they seem though. Obviously, not particularly great either and it's free to play. So cost. You nothing to check it out. I mean, it's an MMO and when your player bases are low, you really do have to go free to play like there's no there's no option to charge money when you game is basically low player base because then both thrives on community, you know, it's a network effect. And if you have no players there is a network effect. Zima spoken. Let's see Maria is a duke or he says, all right, but if he still do Like the Duke of our country rather than like a do Kurt, which is actually poop. Maybe he just really likes the game referring to as a class and ability. Rest in pepperoni WildStar. I cannot believe ncsoft just shut it whilst are down. They should we should like petition to buyer for like $10 just put up our own server. Yeah, I would love classic style star and T stuff. I pay you more than $10 for whilst our okay. Give me the give me the server code give me everything. I'll buy it the official license. All right 10 G's that's the most shocking. Well, it's there. All right the 10 G. That's a real game. Okay. I think we offer like $1,000 like really shitty Korean or Chinese game, but I would love to have a real game. Like well start right like they're not going to sell David. Yeah, and they could sell for more if they want to do they shut it down completely but be cool to have a you know, well, are there any well Sarah private service? I don't know. It's your question. Probably not. I don't think so either. Let me check. Yeah, it'd be cool to have but all right there. Did they have been some active development? Apparently who emulators going for it, but as it was a year ago, I don't think we saw an update since then so I don't think there's any official any like ones making good progress, unfortunately. But because they get it and it does it is sad to see like a full-blown and more PG say what you will about the game media. There's a world there me there's some a few things felt really good about while start the movement and just running around and combat that felt really good A lot of them were kind of screwed it up on that front of like well, it's hard to be good job. Do you I need to work but it is a ran smooth a member. If you try to play the game. I liked in 1920 by 1080 the you I was like a by 50% your screen or more if you have a 2K resolution is to you. I had to go very modern with that one. Yeah, I remember that. Yeah, but it's still set to see it go like when you see like other more be shut down and nobody plays it's not so sad, but seeing a game like WildStar shutdown is a big feelsbadman. Especially when you think there's enough there to keep it running like it's going to be a huge moneymaker, but I feel like so many of these like Chinese Korean games are still running with literally five players, right? So why couldn't Walters keep it running with five players? Yeah. I don't know. I don't know just just just a figure on the game to give it to a if it is super games, you know, and they think about it, but games is still there's some weird shit going to Super Games. Okay. I'm convinced this some kind of money laundering operation. I was like, how could they keep the lights on all time with with this portfolio of games on it? Let's let's appreciate this portfolio for a moment. All right. All right what we got here got Ace Online. We got a satellite maximum players 6. There's not more in there are not more than six players on Ace online right now. Okay. Look at their latest news announcements. Okay there ladies and that's it wasn't was in November 7th 2018. Okay. It's like to you that you know 2018 is that bad and before that, you know these announcements like the scroll at the bottom do I get 20 2013? All right. You can update their rules in 2013 and three years later than announcement in 2016 one year later. They posted one announcement a year. Okay, how are these guys still around? How like and and I still get like press release from them. Sometimes I did them in a partnership. I forgot where I closed beta on December 29th of Glory Ventures on their homepage. That's a December 2019 this year. That's December 2019 2017. All right. Hey ladies, let's take two years ago three years ago. There's some weird shit going on with with with sugar games for sure. Like I don't know what's going on. There's no way they're making money on that business. I know there's some weird announcement recently miss you can find it. Okay. So apparently I Axion announced a publishing deal for Morris infinite Dimension with supe games for five countries and they got a new game coming up boys is a partnership with accessing games for Moore's. If I don't know what Mars infinite Dimension is that game the fact that these chose to partner with supe games tells the game is ass like automatically there's like nobody does like you know what you know, who we should give our game to let's give it the stupid games, you know, they're they're on the ball with their portfolio titles. You know, you look at that website like No, this is like we're games go to die or they died already in the resurrected. Nobody wants to announce that you're working with super games. It is not a good like, you know brag about that. All right, but apparently this game is on guys. Check it out. First until is an oldie. Oh, yeah. It's all that if you search on Mars at the church Mars, if it dimensions of Google Mars, let me give you an I can't find anything about this game. They announced the I got the press release last month the day they're going to be published by super games. Nothing out there, right? There's a trailer on YouTube this reduction. Okay, Shake It Out shake his I've not seen this I search Google for this game you find nothing. I'm excited. It's a Sci-Fi. So I'm going to volume up here. It's unlisted. How'd you find this video? I got you know about it. Oh it there be at me. I'm Burning Bridges. I'm keeping it real. All right. It's a CGI trailer boom unimpressive and Skip around there's no gameplay in here. By putting this game to be published by Super Games sometime. So we have no idea what it is. Great Trail. Yeah. I know what is either but penny is based on a franchise called Mars. I mean they have probably the franchise. Secret on listen Masterpiece of since they said that since they said that news out like only 6 million watch the trailer. So it's not a obviously not doing not doing great. I'm surprised Luna online reborn apparently is a thing on here as well. But I can't imagine if a place that either it's just weird to see this company still around they're doing something they're doing some weird things. I don't know what's going on. This gives got six players online. Well, how about we move on to the post game before they assassinate US for all right. We thought he's a mad shit about forgot them their money laundering schemes and get shut down if we keep going. So, all right guys. All right guys. All right. See you guys in the post game. Take care later for you, too.","– ""I feel like we're getting old or reflex or dying.""

If tonight we can contribute something constructive to the explanation of these phenomena. It might be able to assure these people who have nothing to be alarmed about it first. Seemingly since the dawn of humanity unidentified flying objects have been observed in the skies above us. Whether it be ancient depictions of celestial beings coming down from the heavens or modern-day accounts of alien abduction, the fascination of what life exists outside of our own has captivated many imaginations over Generations. There are countless UFO sightings to cover but I felt there was no better place to start than one of the world's most prolific cases of mass UFO sightings a case of strange sounds odd ships in the sky and so much more. This is the Unsolved Mystery of the Warminster thing. As early as the 1930s a small town in the south west of England known as Warminster had begun to experience some truly odd happenings Warminster is a rather small town a place where everyone knows everyone strange sightings and sounds began to be reported by residents around the area. They started few and far between but gradually over the decades these reports of strange objects and sounds would increase tenfold. There is a rather old TV documentary about the Warminster thing that I have watched in preparation for this video. In this video many residents give firsthand testimonies describing what these sounds were like many of them said the sounds were cracking and Stark in nature. These odd Avenged would practically go on talked about into the mid-60s when the war mr. Thing seemingly made its debut on the grand scale. In 1965 esteemed local journalist Arthur shuttle would would write his first piece about the odd events in the Warminster Journal. He titled this small piece bail. He'll mystery weird noises on Christmas morning. The funny thing about this article is that it was basically hidden in the middle of the page this article shared a very detailed story told to mr. Shuttle would by a local woman named Marjorie by she claims. She had woken up at around 6 a.m. Or so on Christmas morning. She got dressed and began to make her way to church for Christmas mass. And while she walked her out. She began to hear some unsettling noises in an area known as Belle Hill. Marjorie describe these noises very odd. She said and I quote like branches being pulled over gravel. A couple of days after Marjorie shared this story with mr. Shuttle would he would share this bizarre encounter just after the new year as mentioned before the story was pretty much shoved to the back page and practically unnoticeable ass history went though this seemingly small and insignificant story would end up being the Warminster journals. Most prolific story. Not long after the publication of Marjorie by story many other residents began to share their own experiences upwards of 30 people sent in claims of hearing strange sounds that Christmas morning as well these stories seem to verify marjorie's claims and Arthur shuttle would began to compile all the reports. He was getting over the next year. It seemed no matter where you looked on the Warminster Journal at the time alleged encounters with UFOs and odd sounds were everywhere. The year of 1965 may very well hold the record for the most UFO reports in England's history. In the months after the initial Rapport in the Warminster Journal letters continued to pour in from residents who were claiming to have experienced it many were in conjunction with the strain sound Marjorie at heard but strange sightings of unexplained shapes in the sky also began to surface. The descriptions of these strains figures in the sky varied from metallic orbs saucers and most notably cigar-shaped spaceships. Almost always a weird sound accompanied these sightings. These sounds were said to sound like booming or annoying droning in some reports. People said their cars failed after seeing these odd figures in the sky others reported animals acting strangely while these encounters took place. For example, many residents reported dogs behaving very oddly. Some residents tried to get further proof of their experiences many set up cameras and tried to get pictures of these strange figures. This is always easier said than done obviously as if it were as easy to set up a camera and take a picture of something the mystery of many folklore would be lost. Not many had any sort of luck with photographing what they dubbed the thing one resident even claimed he took pictures of the thing but his film would review a damaged burnt film role essentially claiming the thing. Mitted energy that affected cameras contrary to that story though Gordon Faulkner who was a local factory worker who also had a hobby of taking pictures would give Arthur shuttle. What a picture he claimed to be of a UFO. This photo was published in the popular Daily Mirror given permission from Gordon to quote do as he seemed fit with it. Gordon Faulkner would be interviewed by many reporters who wanted the scoop on how he had gotten this iconic picture Gordon seemingly enjoyed this newfound Fame and eagerly shared his information with the public. Many people of course question the validity of Gordon's picture editors for the Daily Mirror even stated the picture could very well be a fake. There are a few audio clips of Gordon's interviews about this picture. Mr. Pullman. In fact has done much to put Warminster on the Flying Saucer map. This is how he got his picture. I had a camera with me. I was taking it down to my sister who wanted to borrow it and as I just have the camera with me. You're like a just and didn't took a picture. The object was staying still all this time. Was it always a nervous moving but moving slowly has been fairly fast. They wouldn't let us say how fast but I couldn't say heaviness. Now. Some people have said that when they try to take a picture of one of these things there's been some mysterious force or radiation that stop camera from working. Did you find this and can stop my Canada? Where have you had people say that this picture is a fake and cause unhappiness. I mean, what do you say to them when they say They're entitled to have an opinion. I know it's not fake and it doesn't really bother me. One of the people think. After this Buzz things would seemingly start to die down a bit among locals, but the phenomena and continue to attract many curious tourists looking for a peek at the legendary war mr. Thing. Many UFO researchers began to show up in the area as well the British UFO research Association also known as before AA which was a newly found a group launched just a couple of years before in 1964 had come to the area in hopes of documenting the phenomenon at this time though the number of sightings began to decrease drastically. Although the phenomenon and seen to have calm down the town of Warminster strongly Embrace their new reputation and residents began to open UFO themed businesses, including a UFO bed and breakfast. This Embrace of their local Legend had earned them a lesser-known nickname Roswell of the UK. Sometime in October 1967. Well over two years after the Warminster thing phenomenon had peaked to local police officers claimed to have seen an aircraft over the town of Devon. Devon is a short drive from Warminster roughly around 2 hours or so away even less depending on the route. You take the officer shared their experience with reporters and they sounded pretty convinced that what they had seen was a UFO. Here's an audio clip of that interview. Ali Bianca is likened unto a cross Contour Willy just said here we go online and we drove out. After its if you know what I mean. We're traveling very fast. Don't know sign that I heard at all. It was was no outside that noise apart from the noise of the car itself Next Generation. The acceleration away from us was terrific. So really we didn't get under it to hear any sign. It was definitely there. It is. Definitely part of Mind by some sort of thing or remotely controlled. It was definitely being controlled to view our car. After this the town of Warminster would quiet down once again with the occasional sighting here there. Warminster would Skyrocket to the world stage one more time though in the mid-1970s crop circles seemingly began to appear in the region out of nowhere at first many would tie this to the strange phenomenon of the thing from 1965 others also tried to tie in the Stonehenge which was close to the area. However, many people obviously claim these crop circles were nothing more than a publicity stunt by the residents desperate for one last liver. attention in Fortune from the thing However, after these crop circles their seemingly has not been any Mass sightings of the Warminster thing. With most of the witnesses now being deceased including Arthur shuttle would the man who introduced the world to the thing all those years ago. Arthur passed away in 1996. He wrote many books about his time and experiences which can still be read Arthur shuttle would would like to claim himself as a skeptic but said he remained a Believer until the very end.

So you never miss an episode of the dark swamp. Several years after the initial sightings Arthur shuttle would was interviewed and shared these thoughts that you will hear in this audio clip. It really puts a lot of things into perspective for me. Well, it certainly changed the life of one man the local newspaper reporter Arthur shuttle would without reservation. He believed that someone or something was trying to make contact the lot of people when I've recapped on their stories. They've had that same Sensation that they feel they feel better. That's not physically but mentally and spiritually particularly. They want to achieve something for the benefit of mankind. I don't think I ever have he's over it when you do go and feeling that's inculcated in you buy this And I think what if you're going too far to say that you feel you've had something like a religious experience. Yes. I don't think that would be exaggerating you. Do you you seem to have a new outlook and you mental outlook on life and you want to help people this is because as most peculiar perhaps and it's almost incredible to you no doubt, but I felt that sensation. I wanted to see it again and I wanted to convince whoever was on board that we weren't antagonistic and what we want. To warmly, welcome them if they care to land and of course they have landed they have landed. 2015 marked the 50-year anniversary of the Warminster thing Legend despite half a century passing by many UFO researchers and fans flocked to the event to show their support. Later that same year an unknown artist painted a large mural on a concrete wall in Warminster memorializing the event that cause so much hysteria so many years ago. Warminster England remains a rather small area with a long mysterious history around it even until this day local residents are uploading videos pictures and audio a strange lights and sounds they are experiencing in the area. Just a few years back in June of 2017 a video recorded by a resident that lives around Clay Hill where several the original encounters were reported. This video shows an odd light in the sky seemingly repeating a circular route. At the end of the day Warminster continues to baffle Millions around the world with its seemingly never-ending source of UFO and unexplained activity whether you believe in UFOs are not this case certainly holds weight in the greater investigation of UFOs and extraterrestrial life. Thanks for watching this documentary detailing the strange and unsolved events of the Warminster thing. What do you think happened?

That was working for man. He'll up to cradle Hill. And then just past the Farmhouse. I'm Kim aware of this. I'm going anything lying in the road and was just absolutely dead scared. It's just as fear. It was just like a fog early but it was perfectly outlining. It was typical classical Flying Saucer using photographs and so on and it just lay there. What across the road And I just went absolutely hot. I didn't know what to make of it. So it was similar to like Doctor Who's Tardis if like it was half here and half not as if it was in another dimension, but it's an incredible experience and I don't expect people to believe unless it happens to them. It's all this and I watched it right at the side right over there. But I looked in that direction there is a silver plane and a pink one like a between a pink in a red series color then right side by side and they were in that direction and there was no play but I don't know where it went to I which is noises hell of a noise it was and King then, you know, it was a bit Misty foggy. and it was like as if a tin cans floating nuts and bolts in our and somebody was rattling it what I did see was a green shimmering light for Backwater an hour, but it's hard to explain just like a bright light for the red light in the middle right should get sagashi.","– In 1965, a woman in Warminster, England, told a local journalist about strange noises she heard on Christmas morning, and the story was picked up by the Warminster Journal.

So we got an email from Justin on the subject of sending us an email. He wrote to us at Nintendo cartridge Society at gmail.com. Just like you can and says Patrick a mark. Hey, I've been a fan of your podcast since March of this year a long time listener to shows like GameXplain and retro knots but when I switched over to Google podcast somehow through Google's magical algorithms your show was recommended to me and ever since that magical day. I've been listening to your podcast until I left to visit my family in Japan this summer. I admit regardless of how awesome your podcast is being in Japan. I was quickly overwhelmed with Japanese gaming stuff and entertainment and then new movie Dragon Quest your story so he didn't hear about sorry. I'm skimming a little bit here. So I didn't hear about this Donkey Kong competition to the podcast this weekend when I was flying home and catching up on the backlog of my podcasts. Well, I decided to take you up on the Donkey Kong 3 challenge. I'm sad to say despite my love for NES and monkeys. I can only handle one night of spraying Donkey Kong with bug spray up his monkey cheeks, so I know my score isn't going to win the Epic sock prize, but I wanted to submit any way Justin. Thank you for submitting. Even if you're not super. Proud of the high score. We appreciate seeing it interesting as something interesting to note when visiting Japan this summer. All the kids are still seem to be highly into Mario Odyssey, even though it's a game that's been out for about two years all their excitement around the game made me decide to finally pick it up. It was a game. I had previously passed on I'm happy I did this because it is so much better than Donkey Kong 3. I was wondering what your thoughts are on collectathon games in general. If you play them. Do you find yourself using guides like YouTube videos to help you complete them or do you attempt with no help at all? I appreciate your awesome podcast Charisma and intro music. Thanks so much. Justin Mark. How do you feel about collectathon games? What's like an example of a collectathon game? So I think in this case, he's using Super Mario Odyssey is like after so many moons are like that kind of thing. Yeah, I mean because it my Odysseys, you know premise is here's a big space find all the moons in it. I do think that Mario Odyssey is one of the best examples are like one of the most fun examples of a collectathon game because most moons require you to do something that is fun. Any way to earn it. I think the bad examples of collectathon games, you know end up being like the Nintendo 64 era rare games or ukulele from a little while back and I mean all like Games if they're designed well, I don't think that the the genre is inherently good or inherently bad and a good one. Like there are a few things. I like more than a good collectathon game. That's very satisfying to me and I just generally I use guides for all humor game that I play like for sure. I feel so bad for guides writers. Oh, yeah because that has to be such a like grinding job. Because the game comes out maybe you have a review copy and you know, like immediately people are trying to like take like fire emblem. For example, right? Yes. Somebody had to compile the list of what gifts go to who and like what lost items Yoda. Who and that's probably just a lot of trial and error total. Just trying to be like do it as fast as possible. Right? And who did I give that look I will use guides for for that sort of thing, but I Also just gone up two characters in Fire Emblem three houses and try to give them everything in my inventory until they're like, oh, yeah. That was mine. Yeah, I which way I wonder which way is faster because I've always looked it up. Oh, yeah, and I wonder if it's just faster just like brute force. It - I've no penalty. No there. I mean, they'll say something like know how would you think that was mine? Some of them? Some of them will be rude about it? Yeah, but it doesn't like show that your relationship is getting worse. So like just keep trying to give them that beat-up coat. It'll be fine. Yeah. Thank you. So Much for writing in Justin. Yes. Thank you. And for yeah, my Odyssey. Yeah, baby. That's a great game. Oh, yeah, that is a great game. Um better than Donkey Kong 3. We'll see. Alright Mark. Let's get into our topic of the week, which is the Nintendo Indie World Showcase. Gamescom going on right now in Germany. Lots of big video game news coming out of it. This is a Nintendo's contribution to that. So it was a couple of things are a little bit different about this one previously in North America. These Indie showcases had been referred to as Mindy showcases. Yes, the Indie World Showcase seems to be a global branding the That they had previously been using in Japan for sure. I think also in Europe then now they're just like making worldwide. I wonder if that's also why we didn't see the presenters on screen like we have previously it was all done in voiceover. Yeah. Well it's so I mean, I guess one of the bigger things that has happened since the last one of these right is that Damon Baker is now no longer he working for a Nintendo. He was around for the one in March either. He yeah that that might be true. The timeline is messed up in the air. But I mean if there was a for that one his fingerprints were probably still on it and some capacity and it seems like this is maybe just that they're falling in line with the international branding. Yeah. I kind of missed the like personal presentation I guess. Yeah. Well, they they weirdly called it out right at the beginning because it's still hosted by Kirk Scott and Katie Casper who is not a Nintendo personality that I was familiar with before but they point out that they're just the disembodied voices of them and not the actual personage. Yeah, but you know, whatever we still learned about like 20 games. So how do you want to do this? You want to like run down like game by game and see if we have anything to say? Yeah about let's do that. Well, first of all, how did you feel about this thing? Was it where they're exciting things in here for you? Yeah, there were there were some stuff that I hadn't heard about or wasn't familiar with or anything. Like that. I also didn't really have any expectations for this Indie showcase because I felt like a lot of the big, you know indie games that would you kind of expect to come to a platform. They've already checked a lot of those boxes in the any good way. And so this was just kind of like, oh cool. This is like a bunch of stuff for the most part that I've never heard of. Yeah. Well and also like you and I are like super year to the ground indie game like PC Gamers anyway, Oh, so, you know a lot of these things are the total surprises to me, which is fun. So the first game out of the box was risk of rain to from gearbox, which they described as a classic roguelike for one to four players coming out summer 2019. Yeah. So the present the trailer the presentation of it is a lot like the edge of tomorrow. Oh, yeah. P movie that's right with Tom Cruise. I like the idea of this game. I didn't I never heard of risk of rain before this is probably a great example of what you were saying that we're not really tuned into the PC Indie scene. But so I the fact that this is the second one is a total surprise to me so friend of the shown June had mentioned to me that this game is still in beta on PC. So it'll be interesting to see how it's presented on switch Yeah, like if it's still like it. Still in its beta form or if they're targeting like proper launch for because Summer 2019 is now right we're running out of Summer 2019, which is sad when you think about it is but let's not dwell on it. Let's not dwell dwell too much on being said, we've got other stuff to talk about the next game on the list here. It was. Oh what actually just a loop back to your live diver Pete thing. Yeah. I really like the way a presented like here are the two Co-op characters and they make a little Grass and then get beaten and then it's like okay attempt number two, and it was just kind of a comical way to present that. I also just like the idea of a co-op like Rogue like yeah my I've never played one before so that idea seems really fun to me. Yeah and seems like it would that would be a fun way to like spend an evening is just what yeah, I'm wondering over and over again. Yeah, I guess you could probably play with like four switches in a room. Yeah. They also in like the fine print during the game. It will also support Nintendo switch online next up was Eastward, which is a game from chuckle fish and picks pole and it's got some very pretty 16 bit Graphics looking a little bit like Earthbound a little like notes of Secret of Evermore and Chrono Trigger. It definitely has the 16-bit look but like the animations are so much more. Yeah than what you could do on a 16-bit system and it looks like it's got kind of a top-down. Zelda like gameplay style to it. We were in someone tweeted at us about this too. Sorry. I don't have that right in front of me, but that we were just talking about Zelda like games like Blossom tail possum Tails blossoms tail blossoms Tails. I don't know. I don't know where the S is in that and yeah, this would be another example of a zelda-like game and it is coming out in 2020 and there's definitely like a part of my brain that anytime this kind of Like art style is invoked that it just starts like yes. I want this. I want this. Yeah, it does it fills and it's just like a little bit different from most of the 16-bit style art that we see where like it's got that extra level of like meticulous pixel by pixel detail. It also just looks a little bit more like Gonzo in a way. It does look a little yes. Yeah. Absolutely. Just a little bit just a little bit crazy speaking of just a little bit crazy Freedom finger. From wide right interactive is a music driven side-scrolling spaceship shmup and that's coming fall 2019. This game looked a little too crazy for me Mark. I don't know about you. Yeah, I mean shmups are not really my thing to begin with totally. Yeah, and then it like it. It seems neat in that. It's got like these different kinds of art styles. Like there's the one that looks very much like kind of Adult Swim animated like mid 2000s decade animation. And then also like goes into like an 8-bit kind of style. But I mean, yeah, I my patience for side-scrolling spaceship shmups runs out pretty quick. It does look very silly. It does look very silly. Also, the they have a list of the musicians who are going to be their tracks are going to be featured in I didn't know must many of them, but they have one by the radio Department, which I thought was really interesting. I'd be super curious. I really like the radio Department. Super curious to know what track they picked. Yeah or like a shmup like game and actually it seems like they this whole game is focused on presentation in a lot of ways. They showed off the voice cast which includes Nolan North and John DiMaggio and two others whose. Yeah, so that part of it actually reminded me not Nolan North maybe John DiMaggio wasn't in I'm thinking a mad world where like a huge selling point of that. Yes. Who's the voice of Bender? John measure? Okay. Yeah was it? It that's probably why he I reminded you of it. But so yeah, it means that you know, they're they're showing off the names of the actors and the names of the bands that provided music for it. So like if nothing else this thing knows what image it's selling and you gotta respect it for that. So next on the in the presentation was a game called Roki. Mmm, which looks very pretty yes, but I have no idea how this game plays. No, because it looks like it's kind of a like isometric or it was this the one that was either isometric or side-scrolling. I can't remember now, but you it just seemed like the character was moving without obstacles and like just in countering creatures. Yeah, it also had that kind of like really electric glowy. Yeah aesthetic to it that remind me a lot of a game coming later. But also reminded me of just like is stuff we had seen before. Yeah, so it's pretty I'm interested to hear more about it, I guess and they just gave the release window of winter for it Torchlight 2 is coming to switch. This had been previously announced but now we know that it's coming on September 3rd and switch players get a free pet unicorn and a free pet yapper. Now. This is not to be confused with the yam. / who is the electric Corgi in the new? Come on, that's right. You got to play Pokemon to get that thing. So really it's just it's Torchlight 2 which was basically a game that exploded before Diablo in popularity exploded in popularity before so this game did not actually explode. No, okay kind of like, Satiating that itch for a Dungeon Crawler type game before Diablo 3 came out and it looks really cool. Again. It's one of those things where like it looks and plays very much like Diablo but definitely has a different personality. Yes much more like cartoony little sillier. I guess it's weird because I feel like Diablo is always toying with the idea of being silly and then it's like no no, we're self-serious and then like, Eight, like maybe there's like a pun in the name of the sword and then it's like no no, but we're very serious next up. We saw a skater Excel from Easy Day Studios, and it seems like they are taking both the like best parts about Tony Hawk Pro Skater and skate and making a skateboarding game out of it. Yeah. So the Arcadia aspects of Tony Hawk Pro Skater. Yes is what always appealed to me about that series that in the Rockin soundtrack. Oh, yeah, give me that gold finger baby. But and so the like with skate and later games that became more like skateboarding simulators. Yeah, that that became much more challenging for me to get into and it does actually seem like this maybe leaning a little bit more into the skate side of thing. Well whenever they're like total board control and physics-based. Yeah. Yeah, then then you know that like, I mean total board control sounds attractive if that's something that you can actually genuinely Master right? But I mean just like a real skateboard. You have total board control on a real skateboard, but you're gonna fall most times especially if we try to do a trick this game is out. Just some time in 2020 then we have Europa. Yeah. It's a like a 3D platformer that And of reminded me of in the little bit that we saw of Captain Toad with some like gravity stuff thrown in. Yeah, there's definitely the the gravity is is way warped that you're like walking around surfaces. Whatever reason the Avatar the character you're playing. Yeah. It was that like kind of like rounded but chunky just like AOL online. Yeah. Yeah Scott thing that becomes orange. I was watching the same like this game has to have been developed. Or up or Montreal this game is so nerve 100% so European the but it looks cute and interesting. I noted that the world of this game seems sort of split uni, like it's vaguely post-apocalyptic and there's like some graffiti around and like you so the tagline for this was you puzzle you platform you paint Europa, which is I don't know. It seems it seems like a cool game. I feel like in describing all of these we have sounded language like insane and also 80 years old sure. We're all like oh, yeah, you know, it's silly. I stand by it comes out comes out this winter super hot super hot and this is just super hot is coming is coming to switch. This game is been on like everything, right? Yeah. I think it's like five or six years old at this point. It is a first person shooter with whereby the action only moves forward time only moves forward when you do so there's a lot of you know, kind of like dodging bullets in bullet time, but I guess you time. And it also dropped on Monday. Yes is one of two stealth drops. Yes that happened around the Indie World Direct. Next up was Dungeon Defenders awakened from chronic games, which includes four players split screen. I didn't know that that was still a thing. Well, they also tee this up by saying it was like an indie classic. Yeah, but I'm not I'm not familiar with this series know neither my it looks kind of like Hack and Slash. Dungeon Crawler, but like is actually 3D like would normally when it's a hack and hack and slash Dungeon Crawler. I think of a Diablo like game but this camera is like nice and low and seems a little bit more Action gaming. This one is a timed console exclusive timed console exclusive. So it's coming to switch first in February 20 20. I wonder if Dungeon Defenders is an indie classic and Dungeon. Defenders awakened is new because there's yeah license was found and I think so. I think that's true. Next was the tourist which is a low poly kind of has like the Minecraft aesthetic a little bit but it's blocky characters but much more defined than like Minecraft. Yes much more detailed and it looks like it's a puzzle Adventure game in like a modern tropical setting. Yeah. So this is I wasn't sure if this is the one that the person who tweeted at us was referring to as like A zelda-like game. I guess it's not like a 2d Zelda game to kind of remind me had like a little bit of like a wind waker Vibe. Yeah, or like a 3D Dot Game Heroes Vibe this Market remember a couple years ago when we were reading was what was the name of this comic series about it was like bird of paradise. Remember this it was like a Hawaiian detective. Yes. I do. Remember this I bet I got Vibes of that series from this game because you're playing like a guy in a Hawaiian shirt like win a mustache and like big aviator glasses who's like exploring, you know caves and tombs and stuff. So it's got a very the the style is very specific. I don't really know what I can tie it to though. I don't know either one thing that I thought was interesting as I was watching the trailers. I was thinking of so many like young adults at this point who grew up playing Minecraft. Yeah and who that sort of like blocky aesthetic. Would have the same sort of nostalgia that when I was talking about, you know anytime. There's that 16-bit total static. I'm super into it. I wonder if we're getting to the point where there are people who that is true for for like the look of Minecraft. Yeah. I mean, I would totally believe that and I feel like the tourist is the first game that I've seen that purposefully are not as kind of capitalizing on that. Yeah. Totally skull boy from ookami games looks like a Real-time combat Paper Mario Os game with horror movie creatures characters. Yeah, there's skeletons and vampires and stuff like that. So if the the characters and like all the background stuff, they're all like pixelated Sprites that exists on like a 3D plane. So it's a little bit octo path travel e traveler E and A little bit Paper Mario asked also they gave a really specific. Release date December 3rd. 2019 lock it in. You can also lock in Earth night from Cleaver soft. So this game looks amazing. Yes. It's like it really has the gameplay. Looks like it really has Sonic Vibes totally except instead of like Green Hill Zone, it's Dragon. It's like dragons flying through the air. So like sometimes this game looks like a shmup right where especially like in the flying sections, but there are also dislike Parts where you know, you're playing as either this little girl or was it an old man like an old man. He's got a big beard. Yeah, and they're like running and dodging, you know around all I call these creatures and like weird platforms and stuff and like the game just looks so pretty has this like almost like painterly like storybook quality to And would also go into like sort of behind the character camera when they're like diving through. I like diving back onto the planet or something. It seems wild this game seems wild. Yeah, it looks really cool. It's probably one of the games that I was most excited about. Yeah coming out of this showcase partly because you don't really see games try to ape Sonic the Hedgehog Ugh, yeah, you definitely don't and you don't really see games going for this kind of visual style either. You know how many times we said pixelated or 16 bit or you know retro were blocky or whatever or even like animated and well this does look like it doesn't look like a cartoon. It looks like someone, you know, like very careful like colored pencil pencil drawings for like a children's book. So it looks like something That nothing else really looks like and plays it looks like Sonic the Hedgehog which no one else really does and it's coming this year. That's right. It seems like it's going to be really cool next. They had a Sizzle reel for the Hotline Miami collection. Yes, which I thought was so funny because if you are not familiar with Hotline Miami at all. Look see what happens no idea. Yeah. It's like the trailer was basically just shots overhead shots zooming in on really pixelated character like that game doing nothing. Yeah particular interest and granted Hotline. Miami is incredibly violent. Yes, they've shown off incredibly violent things before so I'm assuming that yeah, they just figured Hotline Miami people just know what this is. Yeah, you want it or you don't it was the other game that released on Monday? It's a both games for in one download for I think like 25 bucks. Are you You played Hotline Miami? No. I haven't played either of them. Hey me neither, but I played Katana 0 which people say is very similar, even when I was watching the trailer for Hotline Miami the soundtrack started up and I was like, oh, yeah, this soundtrack sounds exactly like Katana 0 which is cool Katana 0 was a really cool game which again props to Earth night for not looking and sounding like everything looks and sounds then we get like a full-blown Sizzle reel for a bunch of games coming out, dude. We just speed through these the way they sped through them. Yeah, I yeah a lot of these I don't even really particularly remember. Yeah. So Blasphemous from Team 17 digital and the game kitchen is a 2d Castlevania. Ask game. That's out September 26 2009 teen close to the Sun from wired Productions and storm in a teacup is an atmospheric first-person puzzle Adventure sometime in 2019 kept quest to which is cats running around with swords and stuff. Fall 2019 Spirit fairer which was an action-platformer out spring 2020 train train. How would you say this trying trying for the nightmare Prince is October 8th 2019 creature in the well, which is a game that we did talk about in the March and indirect. This one actually gets a release date. So it's kind of like a pinball based hack-and-slash kind of game. It looks really cool. I would love to see somebody who's skilled added play and I know from you would be a nightmare. But basically it seems like you're shooting these like electric orbs. Yeah, or like orbs of electric power around here and then you can do very important distinction. It's yeah, I completely the writer electric cords or orbs of electric power and then you're using your sword to kind of like bat them around Orbit on yet to be revealed. But so the release date is September 6th 2019, which is very very And then we saw one finger death punch to don't know what that is, December 2nd 2019 best friend forever. This looks very cute. Yes. This is a dating Sim. Maybe it's a dating Sim. It has some sort of social components. But also you have a dog. Yeah, maybe you're just socializing dogs. Yeah, it could like that also would be super fun. I also just want to mention that we had I we love this is a sidebar. Yeah, we love when people send us which friend request. Yes, you can find. Our friend codes in the show notes. Yes. I saw that one of my friends a listener was playing dream daddy and that reminded me that I need to buy that game I do as well. I feel like this game has a similar aesthetic to dream. Daddy. I think so too. That's what made me think of it. Yeah. Yes. Yes. Obviously I should have put those dots together. It's also best friend forever. It's coming out on February 14th. 2020 Valentine's Day apropos. Very good fogs phog s exclamation mark this it's like you were down. Its a mix of like CatDog the Nicktoons young the early 2000s and snake pass. I believe I wrote It's a nightmare mix of cat dog and snake fast. Okay. So instead of being a cat and a dog, it's using to be two dogs. Yeah, right. There's no getting around the fact. Fact that they look and move like penises. Yes. It's a problem which was not a problem with snake pass or cat dog efficiently. I don't know can't talk makes me uncomfortable. Well, we can't talk. They didn't have to use like Havok physics or whatever. Next up is what the gulf it silly golf game doubt this winter kind or keaney. I'm not really sure. So this looked in this showing here like a moving objects around a space puzzle game it also made an appearance in the Google stadia direct which made it clear that there are musical elements to it to wear like the pieces that you're rolling around our musical instruments and like the music changes as you move them and reconfigure them. So that actually seems a little bit more interesting to me after having seen the stadia thing. They also showed off hypercharge unboxed from digital cyber cherries a toy soldiers first person shooter coming out this winter and they and next was Earth guard which is like a viking Viking style like tactics game September 26 2019 also spark light. This one is kind of like Blossom Tails. Yep. So another one like that fall 2019. And then the last on the sizzle reel was a Munch Sizzle reel. I don't know what I actually said Sizzle reel was the new Munchkin game quacked Quest so munchkin is a card game, right? Is that wine where I know the name from? Okay. Yeah, and they use is It cards or Miniatures. I think it might be both because I know they also do a lot of like license stuff so that you'll see you know, like a Batman Munchkin game or whatever and this doesn't look like it's they're not just bringing a card game to switch. It looks like it's actually a video game again. I will say hack-and-slash again because that's what it looks like and that's fall 2019. And then finally there was a one more thing. Always got to have one more thing. Yeah for Indie world and its Ori and the blind Forest Definitive Edition from Xbox game studios coming September 27th, which is very soon same day as Dragon Quest 11 s Echoes of a hope Echoes of a an elusive ages of age. Yes, if in addition Yes, so this is a was previously an XBox exclusive but that doesn't seem to mean too much anymore. Yeah, the second time one of those games has come to switch after cop head. Yep, and also interesting around the time the cuphead was revealed. There were rumors that Ori and the blind forest was also in the works. So I have not played this game. I don't own an Xbox. I know it's super well-regarded the yeah and looks Or at least from the trailers that we saw on Monday looks very exciting and very good. Like I'm totally going to pick this up and I just really I think it's cool to see Xbox and Nintendo working together or you know, at least like collaborating on games like this because really I you know, Nintendo said this for a long time, but Nintendo and Microsoft are both video game companies, but they don't really play in the same space anymore. Yeah, it's true and like it's interesting because I I do think that Sony plays in the same space as both Microsoft and Nintendo in some ways like they're playing the OU you like our exclusive so you need our platform to play our exclusives like Nintendo, but they're also playing the we have powerful Hardware that can play any game just like Microsoft and maybe this is just some of my own ignorance, but I also feel like Sony makes more of an attempt especially recently to be like Develop games for players of all ages. Yeah, where are so that Microsoft? Yeah. I mean you saw Microsoft's presentation at E3 and it was like we're making games for all kinds of Gamers that are into you know, like hypervisor Islands. Yeah, you know, like there's not really anything for families or kids on. Yeah. Yeah, and so it makes sense to me that Microsoft and Nintendo can kind of Leverage each other's strengths. Yeah. Yeah, and if it means that we get more of the not hyper violent. Microsoft exclusives on Nintendo then. So be it or if you know eventually someday down the line we get don't want to play Gears of War. Oh, okay. Yeah game pass on Nintendo switch would be or even X cloud or any of the Microsoft Services seeing them on switch does not seem impossible doesn't seem inevitable but it seems like something that might happen and would be super cool. Alright, that was that was the new No, not in the Indie World Showcase the Indie World Showcase Mark. Let's close this out. I would love to hear what everyone else is excited for in this thing.

Here we go. You can go yay. Okay. So, how are you guys doing today? We're waiting for George to come back. Does anyone have any suggestions for our topic today? Hey Jordan back. Welcome. We had to have my food and I'm really hungry ex-im. I have to be eating start eating that is totally fine. I have who ban light bulbs or ban? Ballpoint pens? Okay interesting. Wait, what was that? Light bulbs or yeah. Yeah, apparently that that was one of their suggestions ban or ballpoint pens. If you can hear me things I can just let me know and I'll mute my mic. Let me see but Baba where I'm looking ban light. Oh Ben Light mode on every social media. That would be an interesting debate George. One of us is in favor of light mode all the time. Use another is in favor of dark mode all the time. What do you think about that and and I could be pretty interesting. That's interesting. Now. We need we need something with a little bit more flare country music band dogs or band cat. What do you think about that one George? Does that mean and on person buns? Yeah. One person is like we need to have been talks as pets and Heather is we need a band cats as pets. What do you think the ultimate dog? Captivate hmm. What do you guys think? Do you guys like that idea teacher either way with finding your dog or a cat? Oh, here's an interesting one teacher should be replaced with robots. So the argument we could make without one is we say, okay, we want to replace all non Technology based classroom learning experiences with technology including replacing teachers with robots everything. It's replaced with computers tablets and Cetera versus the other person would say no we need to go back to the basics and we need to completely get rid of computers there what's destroying the minds of students and what not and like we need to get rid of computers and go back to paper and pencil. What do you think? Do you want to do that one? All right you guys in the chat? Let let us know which one you think are you in favor of the dog vs. Cat debate or In school one of us is super in favor of it. One of us is super opposed to it. Which one would you guys like to see? I'm thinking a lot of pets. Yeah, it's Marta pets as I can see. Yeah, there are a lot of pets who someone said ban gaming chairs. Oh my goodness pets pets everyone can drive pets pets. Oh, come on guys this so this would be a great one. Ooh, there's an interesting idea. Everybody can drive versus only a select few people can Drive find guys, if we getting a dog and cat debate, it's just going to be us like, how do you even argue like this her skin to make so many people mad because like if I get the band dog, so I'm like what am I gonna say? We take my rat in the holler off to this like and then like what might you do? That one is it huh? Like you're arguing one person argues that we should get rid of dogs. And is it the other person saying we should keep dogs or that we should get rid of cats. Get rid of cats instead of you win because like, you know, I'll give you a speech other convince the audience that you're defending your position the best come. Brother Ty cattle and oh my God, you know pets are oh there's an interesting idea. No pets versus you have to have a pet. That's that would be an interesting one. What do you think? Um, the basically one of us would defend having pets is a bad idea / says the other defends know everybody should be required to have a pet. That could also work. That would be a little bit more. Balance but who am I gonna say and when we know I've realized that having my rat is it you want that's the point the show. Okay guys, what do you want the technology in school one or the pets debate? Which one do you guys like teachers replace teachers with robots or pet debate? Which one band gaming gaming chairs everywhere could be worse and worse every time that's that's an idea. We had up for pi area wants to hear the stink impact of it. All right, George the debate topic for the day is Pets. The rule is this. Okay? Yeah, so we will say it like this. A pet will be defined as an animal. So we're not talking about bugs. Okay and animal even though we know you can have bugs as pets we're just defining the terms a pet will be defined as an animal mammal or reptile or I guess of amphibian a frog whatever Turtle Etc that you but no bugs. No bugs. Obviously. Yes, and it has Has to be one bugs it has to be an animal that requires leak air and it can't be a fish because fish pretty much require no care because they're fish now, I'm just kidding face to look like are you want let's let's just list off like, okay, let's create a list of like approved pets. So hamster snake turtle dog cat bird. Pretty much you have a pet, but it has to be like what people would consider like a main pet. I mean fish can remain Straight Street has yeah. It has to be something that is a pet that can move about and it's not just confined to a snake. Yeah. Well snakes you can like take out something that you can like take out and move about so when you put the fish in the ocean, okay, stop it. Now what I'm saying is you're not going to take your fish out of your it has to be An interactive pet something that if you can't physically take it out hold it and carry it around your house. Then it doesn't count. Okay. Okay, it has to be and we'll say that when you have a pet you have to interact with it Bailey is part of the rule so you can't just be like, okay. Well, I have a hamster and they just keep it in there and I put it in there every so often to make sure I'm following the law. Okay, so it's mandatory you have to interact so this is the debate. One of us is taking in favor of that position. Everybody should have a pet. One of the approved pads that you have to interact with and you can move about we'll call it the approved pet and the other of us says no having any type of pet is bad and All Pets should be banned and will to make their position easier will say that. We're not advocating just rounding up all the pets and executing them just from that point on no more pets. So basically as soon as your current pets, you know passed away or if you get rid of them that you can't replace them with new pets. Okay, that will make that person's position easier. So after like, you know, 10 or 20 and we're like 20 years. Nobody would have any pets anymore except for Birds because birds live forever forever. This is Immortal birds were so outlive all huh. Anyway, how about this through 20 years anyone who still asks has Pets As to put them into the shoes Okay, because the immortal birds. All right. So there there we go. That's our proposed arguments. You do agree with the terms and conditions George. Yep. Okay, everybody in the chat kind of understand what we're talking about. All right, here we go heads. Or tails, I will have heads. Okay. So how about this heads and you're in favor Banning pets tail? Okay. I'm in favor Banning pets. Okay. Yeah, here we go. He's Vitae else. Hey Siri flip a coin please else. Yeah. Okay. Well, so I am in favor Banning pets you are in favor of Everybody knows been any better you're in favor of these pet requirement. I guess jawed. George what I don't know who Jordan. Oh freak. Sorry, Jordan George. All right, guys We've ran up this show. It's about picking a silly debate topic and having each of us seriously defendant as if we actually believe that anything we say in the debate is not something we actually believe we're free to go as crazy as we want George then favor of a pet roryd virant reptilians. Lord is in favor of a pet requirement man that you see from the website average ordered instead of charge. That's it explaining. Everybody should be required to have a pet and one of the approved pets and that it should be mandated. If you don't have a pet you will be forced by law to get one. I however and taking up the position of I think that pets are bad and they Should be banned and you know, you know as everybody can keep their current pets. But as soon as their pets die, nobody will be able to replace them with new pets. That's my position. Are you ready? George do you want to do opening arguments First Auto one? Do you want to go first or should I go first you go ahead and go first. Okay. Okay, so yes pets are good. Okay, so basically We know for a fact that animals can improve the well-being of humans regular Bulldogs make people happier in 99% of cases. So basically what I'm trying to say is pet will improve the overall happiness of the world though by forcing people to have pets we can you know, it's things like depression loneliness because you know pets are friends. They can be your best friend. Some people's only friends are their pets. So people that don't have pets and are alone. They might not realize that we want that they want to pet and that it would make them happier. So by forcing them to have a pet they can see correct way of life of having a pet, you know, so Basically, we need to we need a set of pads for everyone now. I know what you're going to say. Oh, some people are allergic to dogs. So that's why we have a huge list of available pet to ensure that there will be a pet available for someone that is allergic to certain types of animals that who is allergic to a snake. I don't think anyone is but snakes can be Man's Best Friend second. Best friend may be second best makes a very useful as well. I mean some pets can be actually useful, you know, like cats for example, they eat little bugs around your house and you kill mice and rats that are stuck in your house. They they just good, you know, couldn't rodent what-do-you-call-it rodent control. I don't know they do they do that kind of stuff. They're good for that so we could reduce. Illnesses that people get from having these is vermin running around their house. So yeah, I think pets are a necessity and we should we should start this right now. Okay, I will get my opening arguments now pets are Satan. Okay, how many times have you walked around and stepped in dog poo Okay, how many times have you had to smell a dirty litter box? How many times have you been bit by your neighbor's dog? Okay, how many times have you gone over to your friend's house and found that they had a snake. And you are afraid of snakes Okay, how many times have you experienced a bad or negative reaction to pets every single person in the world has those experiences? Okay, what needs to happen is we need to protect people. Okay. We need to protect them from other people causing problems. Okay, those people who get those big dogs that attack other people or kill other people. Guess what not going to be a problem because with my bill when it passes all pet will be banned. Okay. Nobody will be able to have dogs that attacked children. Nobody will be leaving their animals fecal matter in your yard or on the sidewalk where you can step on it. Okay, you won't have strange creatures roaming the neighborhood just because people didn't want to care about them but not only will not having pets be good for everybody in. All Humans it will also be good for the animals it will save animals from being adopted into abusive homes where people don't care about them. Okay, and then they wait until they're out of their puppy or their kitten vase and then all of a sudden it's like, oh, well, I don't want this dog anymore. It's not as cute as when I bought it and then they quickly just throw it out into the street or they put it into a pound where it gets euthanized that is not the way that animals should be treated. Stood and because humans have shown an inept irresponsibility at treating man's best friend and treating animals with kindness. We have lost our right to keep these animals and to have them if we cannot treat them right we should not take care of them at all. All right. It is time for the freestyle debate portion of the show. Let's get right into it. All right, George you went first to go ahead and open up. So just faced with something what you just said. You said at the beginning you oh how many times have you had a bad experience with a pet or stepped in dog poop or whatever. These experiences are still going to happen like these? The not just gonna disappear. Okay. There's still going to be donkeys don't gonna is still good. Let me dog. Poo on the floor don't last step in every day only because these are not just going to disappear. No all oh so you would Advocate putting the animals to sleep in said no I advocate for this period okay, we're what will happen is over the course of 20 years as people's animals and pets naturally die off what will happen is they're just not allowed to replace. Place them so people will still get to spend time with the pets they love but my bill will have a slowly impact and eventually what will happen is there will be no more pets chilling out there. Where do you think these dogs going to be that's going to be dogs and cats is -3 coz we won't be breathing anymore dogs. Okay, we won't see no wild animals those so we're gonna breed and there will be wild animals that will be allowed to roam and be in their natural habitat. We're not going to go around but he'll all my friends to my point is we're still going Have we still going to interact with these wild animal? That's no good. Not gonna be any wild animals are still gonna be there in your thing missing that want to be even one because because currently we're kind of in way controlling the population will these animals so that will take control their knowledge. They don't have a crazies and wild all those diseases. So right now, oh actually do you guys remember we have that control? That's because coyotes no BFA know if we if we and the pets then they these pets are just going to be out in the wild instead of been our homes like just because we're not each now said we are not the only source of cats humans aren't the only source of cats and dogs. Yes, but Wildcats can go back into their natural and also right maybe why don't you know, how many stray dogs and cats are on the streets? There are so many right now exactly my point proven Channel why they're out there because people decide they don't want to take care of them anymore. But this is why we should host people there. After the happy face, this is why I think it's okay. They won't be throwing around the streets. Let's before so many people homeless dogs and cats a donor gave we don't post you want people for would look after them because we would force them. They'd be checks exactly. What going in going around and making sure they're not destroying the well-being there and that's gonna be absurdly expensive know what you're gonna have and your think he's loving full and whenever the ever wonder sentences use know whenever the inspectors Come around it's gonna go. No, we're I'm totally taking care of fluffy or whatever but the second the inspector is gone and you know what goes back they'll probably be people that will do the pre because people love animals we have so many volunteers will be wanting to do this for free the No No, they're doing the job properly now have dog lovers cat lovers everything going around making sure that the well-being of these cats and dogs are acceptable. Guess what not acceptable you shut up. The perfect point that there are already so many dogs and so many That's on the streets. Okay, if people really wanted to take care of them they could open up their doors and open up their hearts to bring this animal saying but they're not okay. And do you know why that why is there so many bad owners who chose not to be good people and chose to disrespect the animals because they don't actually care about them, and that is why I think Americans and people in general. Everybody has lost their responsibilities or has lost their right to take care of pets. Bye. Us collectively getting pets and mistreating them. Okay. Yes icon icon deny. There are people right now treat that pass by but yeah and you want to force them to have pets USA. Hey you because we want to have regulations on us. Here's another one. We will make sure that they treat the correctly. How are you going to do that again? You gonna put a camera and an inspector to select enough like I said a time and like I said, like I said already people that will actually volunteer for this because people love pets and the one Make sure that the well-being of hats in the area of good people to monitor the pets a hundred percent of time. You will have people in one only one more time a hundred percent of the time if you if you won't miss treating your pet the science not just like you see ya when they when they come to look at your house and they'll be like, oh, yeah this yet. This cat is fine. They'll be up to see if it's like skinny if it's fit looks bad if it looks know if anything sect you the minimum requirements to make sure that their animal looks well cared for so that the minimum minimum requirements so they don't get in trouble. But guess what George the minimum requirements is not what a dog not what a cat not with any animal deserves. They deserve the best. Okay, and we have not given them the best we have lost our right to have them. So we they deserve the best but now you just want to just get rid of them like just destroy that I don't know. End to the cycle of torture and abuse. Okay. I'm not saying we go around up everybody's pets and take them away right now. Let the people who are still loving and caring for their pets Keith them. I'm just saying hey no more pets from this we would like you said so Ted after 20 years everyone what happens to the Past layers to a zoo. They can go after we have to set a deadline at some point after 20 years, which will only be a tiny tiny fraction of the past left literally like less than a percent of a percent and they'll just go to a zoo or a Care Center where people will be able to take care of them. They were or maybe in 20 years, but then he will have been to be runes. There's still going to be Petty laughter. So like take care of the animals appropriately maybe at that point will be by these animals is still going to be existing. We don't just going to wipe out every single. What do you call them? The price of an option is let's just breed way way way way more of these animals require everybody to have one in. Home including the people who don't want one including the pieces are already in hot as he key. There are already enough for everyone to have one. Yeah, you just want to put them in home some people who don't want them and who aren't going to take care of them. Do you like snakes George? Yeah, there are people who don't like snakes but you want to require the navis honey. We don't have to force people have a snake Okay, let's take the list of available animal only animal on your list that they aren't allergic to because most the other animals have fur and let's just say they don't like steaks. Well, it looks like I'm gonna have to get over a good for a snake to have an owner who's in constant fear of them. Best thing should be in the home of somebody who cares about them or better not better yet. It should be in the wild. Why are we constantly domestic? In pets that belong in the wild and keeping them in a little glass box. How is that better for the animal? Why not? Just stop taking wild creatures and putting them inside these containers. Why not? We just let them roam in the wild. Okay, let's stop mistreating animals. We need to end this cycle of abuse. What do you think would happen if we just started putting all these animals that we've currently got as pets Into the Wild what do you think would happen? I'm asking anyway. They would all get killed off because they're currently domesticated. He can't just no one saying we need caught in the wild. You can understand all these animals in the wild. They will be getting killed by everything that's out there. They'll probably half the elephant has died. If you put your dog your dog outside, they probably just I'm not even being too cold and I'm not saying I'm not saying people should put their pets or put their dogs and the wild that is not what I'm saying at all. Okay, all I'm saying is that people just listen to this they have until their pets that they have died off which will in 20 years again, that's going to be over 99.9% of pets. Okay, and then the remainder of the pets can go to live out the rest of their lives in facilities where they will be taking care of by volunteers and which know how many facilities we will need to know how many pets there are there so many pets do we need to be of the House of me one of these are really any because it's lovely in 20 years. Because during any time is the would not do many animal because people will not only one have enough people to the cops of them. Probably like he allowed to get any pets. No. Yes, you can't just say no. Well, you suck. Yeah, you're advocating literally taking animals forcing you on everything we're seeing people but was don't with them not have pets. Look. I'm not saying it's bad for people to not want pets. But I'm saying having somebody who doesn't want a pet or eat them all the cool whatever quieter for it. There are people That have you know, like guide dogs. They need those dogs how you just going to take them away that I wouldn't consider a pet. I would consider that that is but that is an option of life. I'm not gonna take away somebody's heart rate about it. Sounds like you want to take away now by dog guide on you so many time people like just having to like without that guy. That's that's an animal as utility. Those people are exempt. Yeah, there's some people who turn their guide dogs into pets. But if you needed animal for assistance, then that animal would be exempt from that. Well, there are some people that are more like an assistant. Well, you're gonna say the same what should we be quiet rotary's are you saying secretaries the same as guide? I'm staying that secretary provided work by guide dogs not advocating getting rid of eyes of this is looking pretty good some bad, but one bad no, I want to end the Pete away. Getting some got hungry or using the USA like guide dogs out of the equation. But what about people that have dogs but you know for depression purposes, they have comfort dogs that are this there. So those dogs are demanding an important role that again. I think if you can these dogs are also even can show that you have a genuine need for an animal like that that guess what it's now not necessarily a pet so much. It might still be considered a pet by that person but it also serves serves a function and a working function. So it's a working animal and I would say that any working animal would be exempt from the policy. It's the alike. Otherwise, I might as well be banning dishwashers and whatnot. Like that's come on George, but the point is people answer me this charge. Do you think people collectively as a whole had been treating animals with the care and respect they deserve I was a ho do you imagine answer the question? Do you think the animals are being treated hope? Yes, they are. Okay, well held that all the dogs and all the cats that have been thrown out onto the street or well then they wouldn't just be on the streets. There are people that get who want. There are people get together still many more Tools in they consider their lesson. There are still people right now, they get pets without considering the full kind of responsibility that they require. So once they get them like oh, I don't want this one. They just throw it out though. Exactly that's gonna happen to now when that happens that's person. When you to happen, then we can reallocate that pet to a person to another home of somebody who's not going to want it or take care of it. Let me know our pets but also they won't have a choice though have to like it and know how no matter what you'll instead happen. This is what's gonna happen with your policy. Somebody is going to get a puppy Okay and then go back. Well, I have to get a dog. All right have to I have to get a pet. So I'll just get a puppy that I really like they'll have the puppy tell us out of its puppy phase and then they'll put it into a pound which is going to make the dog really obscure the word. I won't be home the new they'll meet the same policy. Just getting a new puppy and the rinse and repeat where they will continue to get rid of the dog because they don't want to do with it when it's big but get rid of the dog every time it gets out of its puppy face and they'll put it in the pan and then somebody else will buy your law. Ha be given that dog who maybe they won't want to take care of it either. Okay, because they won't have grown up with it and it's puppy for you. So they just don't want to have pets but you're requiring them to have one why continue to put dogs through that stressful situation. There are already many more dogs and remove the thing is an animal because they'll have to keep the pet by the law. I said have them just keep that dog and mistreated. They were they won't be rather than I had ever got messed up. We're gonna have checks and sure that they're being treated correctly. Okay. Well those checks are not going to be sufficient in my opinion. I don't think you're going to be because you're not going to be able to watch the pets and the Animals a hundred percent of the time. You're not going to be able to see when the person hits their animal. Okay, you're not going to be able to see the emotional abuse because the owner just keeps their animal in a cage 24/7 or got not going to be able to see any of that. Okay. Well, at least I'm the inspector told without it won't be announced will be random. It'll just knock on the door. Yeah. Well, no, I don't beat you'll be someone there's here with. Uniformity than I know it won't be it won't be someone in uniform just be someone knocking on the door. You don't know. Is it a delivery? I don't know. Oh, yeah, that's your business. I'm gonna figure that. I don't know and what are you gonna do about? What are you gonna do? You gonna find the person so even if you find them how does that repair the emotional abuse in the emotional damage that was done to the animal? How does that make it a little bit of a be a bit of a phase at the beginning where? Yes, the pets may have a bit of a Poor experience, but as people realize that they're going to get fine and the final go up and up each time. So let's say the first time you get find maybe a hundred of us the next time thousand dollars. Okay, you are not going to want to risk treating their pets badly because they will just go bankrupt because of it now. So basically just gets we were in the same way that people work their way around other types of finds. I not in this one thing right and how would you get around of them people Jordans? We will have unannounced People turning up and making sure you're getting them correctly. And if you're not yet fine a fat fine, and for a lot of people they can't afford to have that so they will instead look after their pet because it will be more they will mix and make sense to do that through the motions required and as a whole moon race will become nicer race because we will be like, oh, yes ever will be becoming nicer towards animals. Why? Should we care about the people who have been taking advantage and abusing these animals for years and years and years? Okay, they don't deserve the kindness and the loving care that these animals have been returning despite the abuse and the mistreatment. Okay humans have lost their right to have pets to have these loving caring animals in their home. Due to their constant mystery that mistreatment if we did not I would not be advocating this position if I felt like humans been trying to work on it, but clearly we have not clearly. They're still way too much abuse way too many animals being put in pounds and in shelters and being put to sleep. I I say enough is enough animals and pets deserve better this but others believe in us this isn't gonna happen because people will be looking after their pets because they won't want to retain people that are losing all that money to fines. People will not be losing money just so they will. Oh, yeah, let's just abuse my animals for no reason. Because they're going to get charged a lot of money for doing that is they're not going to do it anymore. Now, you want the single people. You just said no, you can't just you know, you want the same people who have been used only you know that for you were gonna go find a $20 hat. Then you would treat the pet pocket good, you know is somebody who just goes through the motions and making sure their pet is well groomed and well well cared for as far as like exercise and and properly fed. Is that really all Takes to take care of a pet or is there an emotional attachment and investment emotionally that also has to go through where your pet needs to know that you love and you care for it as well. I think there's more to it if your parents literally just make sure you were fed and clothed and make sure you were healthy and that you had gone to school but you had no emotional connection to them. Is that enough for you or you going to be satisfied with that? No, you're not and that's all that people are going to be. Giving to these animals that they're being required to care for it. They're not going to be giving them the emotional investment required because they don't want to have them anyway, okay, or they only want to have them when they're a cute puppy or kitten. Okay. Now you're requiring those people to take care of their pets for longer guess what's going to happen? There will be a bunch of animals who will be emotionally starved and I am a hundred and ten percent against that I don't want to see any animals in that situation. Well, then I propose hmm. sessions where you must take your pet to and you must engage in activities with your pets though, they'll be I don't know they'll be little enter around different cities and you can just take your going to have to take a pashtun ache in your hamster there. Yes, you have to take your pet. They'll be specialized centers for each kind of animal and you're going to take your pepper and they'll be fun activity setup and I'll be so fun. Everyone's everybody's going to be required as your pet there. How will be fun? How are you? We haven't worked this bit out. Yeah, it could be a well. It sounds a lot more working out because even if you mandated the exact details and not to necessary to know right now about let's say we manage the general. Oh, look, I take my pet there once a month and spend a couple hours with it there and then it goes right back at home into another emotionally abusive situation and maybe was that all bad and said, oh boy, I got that one out online system where you can basically we have you know, like hey, I Are you plug your camera into and they can detect if you are being affectionate towards animals, then you have just lost like camera is a come out of time everybody else. Yeah, that is beyond the scope of the the idea of your purpose lesson lesson. It's perfectly safe. The the data will not be the natural video day to be on camera. We fired our cameras in their homes for video data will not transfer third outside of the Home. Yeah. Okay. Sure. It's that K will be first I thought well, we the software will be written by you know, like a reputable Source such as I don't know who Google Google exactly. Now, you're going down a company known as a rabbi software will be open source. Okay, it will be able to be checked by everyone. Okay, we will ensure that. Yeah checked under the video. I defied no Reba, no will be a working model and agile that it was just online but something he if it's not going to be transferred outside people will be on just text but something over the camera. How are you going to mandate this now? You have to ask you to see it since of hacks holies have to come down to make sure you're not covering up your cam new because the software will be able to detect if you're doing that. There's just going to be monitoring your home a hundred percent. I thought it went that doesn't sound like a bad idea at all who is just monitoring for a very specific activity. Yeah, which is Lyra interesting to be filming and recording it in case it gets the data wrong. So you want something in your home. It will just be recording and ensuring that you are interacting with your animals Corral does it's no problem because you does still have people who just don't care and they will mistreat their animal. Okay, or they will just do the bare minimum. They might go through the motions without putting any of this particular to the anime gonna surf better. Okay, is that gonna do something again? Things are gonna go put in jail, and they won't be able to they were both living anymore say they'll be executed. I said they were no I would never get X I just said they would be fined and put in jail executed. Okay, so basically Ali all right guys, here we go. So it's time for closing arguments. Wow. Are you ready George to give D'Elia closing arguments? Okay, we're gonna deliver closing arguments and then we'll put up a poll. Here we go. So George you want to go first or second I go second and yeah you get a closing argument was here first. Okay. I am not arguing that pets are not a good thing. I am arguing that humans have mistreated them for years and years. Yes, some people do take care of their animals, but the overwhelming fact is there are so many animals that are mistreated on a day-to-day basis by their owners, bye-bye. People who just want them when they're cute and get rid of them the second they get older and those animals get shipped off to pounds and they get put to sleep because there aren't enough people going out and adopting them and simply taking those animals from that situation and putting them in another home with somebody who isn't going to love and care about them and it's just going to keep them as a requirement in order to not get fined is not a better situation animals deserve. Better animals deserve true kindness. They deserve true love true compassion true caring true nurturing. They deserve a truth and a reality that humans have not all been providing them. We have not been fulfilling our obligation. Okay, we have not been taking care of these animals to the degree that they need to be taken care of. And because of that we have forfeited are right my opinion, too. You have these animals. We have lost our responsibility maybe after years 30 years, whatever after we have gone without them. Maybe we will we will be able to treat it as the responsibility it is. Maybe we'll be able to recognize based on what we've lost that this is something we need to take seriously and maybe then we can have another go at it. But right now we're not fulfilling that role. We are not fulfilling that obligation. I want to protect. Pat's I want to protect the animals and that is why we need to ban them. That is why we have a 20-year phase-out period And then after that very very very small percentage of animals can be put in care facilities where they can get love and attention Okay not put in cold harsh adoption and basically kill centers where animals are put in when they get super old and the people who adopted them just too tired of them. Okay. I'm a hundred percent against that tree. Amount of animals and that is why I'm in favor by position that we need to ban pets in order to protect the animals from this abuse. Okay. Well based on what I said in my earlier arguments, it's actually going to be a lot safer for pets and animals if we force everyone to have these pets because we're going to have the the inspectors that make sure you're treating them good. We're going to have the AR a software that's going to be ensuring that you're interacting with them. There's going to be all these systems put in place they're going to ensure That the pets are treated well and not just well, they're treated good. Okay, they will probably actually increase the the average pets Quality of Life by doing this. Okay, because they'll be we're going so many pets off the streets and into homes that whether they like it or not. They will be treating them nicely. Okay? So basically pets and animals are going to have a better life after all these systems are put into place and a people actually realize that they enjoy having a pet when before they didn't know because they had never had one before and then even humans lives will be improved. So basically, I think this is a very good idea and and everyone should have pets the end. am I passed argument response to that is Georgia's Position will start in this position will advocate for the bare minimum care in order to not get in trouble and animals and pets deserve more than the bare minimum. They deserve the best and I and my argument which is a poor argument because I did say that that wouldn't happen. But okay. Alright. Well. Alright guys, I'm supposed to Paul on Twitter as a response replied. Last week remember vote for who you think defended their position the best not just who you personally like the most I'm going to post it. It's been for George myself tie or if you missed the debate, but for that here we go. I'm going to go ahead and post it absence of games and it does not put us now we have time. Yes, we're going to play a song when we get back. We'll look at the results. You have five minutes to vote every go vote for me as a reply to my latest tweet go luck at sea. It's of games. You can see it everybody give up turn it up. My name is Jesse. My name is Adam away from Ben Maroon 5 older hit. I'm alive everybody and we're back and let's go ahead and check the pull. Oh George, you lost 15% party 52% You guys are awesome. Thank you. I'm pretty see you guys supporting my better arguments. What do you what do you think about that George? Did you think at the start that you had the easier section to defend? Well, I don't know. I think I don't know. I think sometimes it's easier to defend the the side. That is I guess more stupid. I think what it's like where's Lee absurd I guess is as good as for Monty as I think you and I when I first I know foods for the about and 16 I wasn't I wasn't thinking that everyone will be forced to have a pet. I was thinking that would just not forced to not have a pet. You know, which made it a bit. Well a lot harder because everyone has to have a pet instead of just arguing against you saying that it was shouldn't have a pet. They're both very absurd positions, but I think you did a pretty good job. I think my my emotional appeals in arguments were Really hit with a lot of people because there was there was a lot of Truth to what I was saying as far as there are a lot of people, you know, don't take care of their owner. Sorry don't get their pets. But you also said a lot of truth in your position and then there are people who, you know could benefit a lot from having a pet and it could soften you their hard exterior. So I think that we both said a lot of Truth in our arguments, but at the end of the day, you know the people I didn't favorite me George. Don't worry. You'll win one of these someday maybe eventually I promise George that as soon as soon as he won one. I think you can he wouldn't have to be in him anymore. So so he was like today's the day that I'm gonna win this one and now we will get pretty good. You did good charge. This was this one was would have been a hard one. No results. It says 17 249. That's quite a bit of a An L but it's okay. Well, I just I did it start. I thought I'd just toast just because I was like, how am I gonna defend, you know people not being able to have like a pet but it makes it whereas fun. It was a good debate. You did a great job George Siri. Definitely a fun person to debate with thank you. I'm funnest. Yeah the most pointless anyway guys Thank you for tuning in to the debate podcast.

On April fifteenth, nineteen seventy-four several customers stood in line at a Hibernia Bank branch in San Francisco waiting for their turn with the teller suddenly a small group of people burst into the lobby yelling and waving guns shooting into the air. They informed the customers that they were members of The symbionese Liberation Army and on a mission to dismantle the capitalist system of Oppression during the robbery. Bank customers noticed a thin young woman standing near the door of the bank watching over the Frantic crowd. She was holding a gun that looked far too large for her slight frame the woman raised her weapon and tried to shoot up into the air but her gun jammed. She let it fall to her side and shouted into the chaos quote. This is Tanya Patricia Hearst first person puts his head up. I'll blow his head off.

Patricia Hearst was targeted by the SLA and detailed her kidnapping on February 4th 1974 for the first two months of her captivity. Patricia was locked in a closet blindfolded and only taken out to use the bathroom and occasionally shower the SLA educated her on the tenants of their Revolution teaching her how and why the system was corrupt and To be dismantled and Patricia learned that the more sympathetic she was to the SLA and their radical ideas the more freedoms and rewards she received through the course of her imprisonment. She gained sympathy for and from her captors developing Stockholm syndrome, eventually, she joined her kidnappers cause and pledged her life to the SLA. Assuming the name Tanya this week. We'll cover Patricia's time as a self-described urban Guerrilla. And the events that led to her arrest will also follow her highly publicized trial in which the world questioned the validity of her claim that the SLA had brainwashed her throughout Patricia's initial captivity in the spring of 1974. Donald defries. The leader of the SLA regularly sent tape recorded messages to local radio stations. He called them communicate. He's using them to detail the goals of the SLA and His Ransom demands on a few tapes to freeze Force Patricia to speak. She alleged that he told her what to say, but made her say it in her own words in 1 communique. She addressed her parents directly criticizing their response to her kidnapping defries recorded a new tape after Patricia pledged herself to the SLA to announce her conversion to the world. It was played on local radio stations on April 3rd, 1974 in the message. Patricia stated that she was free to leave the SLA but had chosen to stay and help them in their fight against oppression. She insulted her parents and her fiance Steven weed. She actually broke up with him in the recording referring to him as her ex-fiance in her autobiography Patty Hearst her own story Patricia wrote. She didn't believe any of what she said she did whatever she was told so she would survive before we get into Patricia psychology. Just a quick disclaimer. Vanessa is not a licensed psychologist or psychiatrist, but she's done a lot of research for this show. Thanks Sammy. According to psychiatrist Tina J. Walsh victims can succumb to a state of helplessness and powerlessness shortly after being kidnapped according to Walch instead of being tortured you receive kindness, you are given a drop of water. You're not beaten you begin to develop feelings of gratitude over time. It wears on even the strongest person. So with that gratitude awakened and a strong will to live Patricia said goodbye to her old life and fully embraced the SLA. She started weapons and Fitness training with the other members and stood guard with them. She even learned to make pipe bombs. Now that she was one of them defries issued her a machine gun of her own but despite this newfound Freedom Patricia, never considered escaping in her autobiography. She noted that all of the Sell a member slept with guns. There was never a chance for her to leave. Shortly after welcoming Tanya into the fold the SLA began to plan their next big mission robbing a bank. They decided on this crime for two reasons first. They wanted to further their mission of fighting capitalism through terrorist actions. They plan the robbery for April 15 1974 tax day. They wanted to show the world that they could destroy Rich capitalist institutions the second and more practical. Reason, they needed money. They had to pay rent on their safe house and feed the nine adults living there defries laid out the logistics of their plan informing Patricia that she would be an active participant she and five other SLA members would storm the bank take the cash and escaped in a getaway car during the robbery. Patricia was to stand by the door and make sure all of the customers saw her defries wanted her to shoot into the air and announce her. Self as Tanya she seemed to be more of a propaganda symbol than anything else in selecting which bank to Target the SLA specifically scouted for a bank with security cameras. They wanted images for the media to use that proved Patricia had joined them in 1974 security cameras were still a pretty new technology. So there weren't many banks to choose from they eventually selected a Hibernia Bank in San Francisco in her autobiography, Patricia said That defries came to her in private before the robbery. He told her quote if you mess up if you do anything different from what you're supposed to you're dead. He still wasn't completely certain that she had converted to their cause this was Patricia's chance to show him that she had the next morning the SLA executed their carefully laid plans at 9:40 a.m. On April 15th, Patricia and the other SLA members stormed the hi. a barnea bank the robbery lasted just a few minutes and the SLA walked away with over 10,000 dollars, but more importantly the world would soon see that Patricia was willingly involved in the SLA even faced with the video evidence Randy and Catherine Hearst continued to support their daughter Jeffrey toobin noted in his book American heiress that Randy told the media quote no matter what she says and does as long as she is Control of the SLA we know she is not acting of her own free will whatever legal problems are in her future. We will be there for her when the FBI examined photographs from the robbery. They noticed other SLA members kept their guns trained on Patricia. They reported that she may have been acting under duress and coercion the FBI issued warrants for three women. They identified as SLA members Nancy Ling Perry Camilla City Hall and Patricia missed moonsault to sick charging them with bank robbery. They also issued a warrant for Patricia charging her with being a material witness to a bank robbery and kidnapping James L Browning United States Attorney for the Northern District of California said the Patricia was not charged with robbery because there is reason to believe that she may not have been acting under her own will but over the next few weeks the matter grew complicated on April 24th, 1974 the SLA set the record straight sending a new tape-recorded message to a local radio station on the tape Patricia directly incriminated herself. She claimed responsibility for the robbery and insisted. She wasn't brainwashed. She was a loyal member of the SLA happy to fight for their cause she condemned the FBI for charging her comrades and not herself though. It may seem strange for her to defend her kidnappers in this way, according to psychiatrist Joseph M Carver the combination of Stockholm syndrome and cognitive dissonance produces a victim who firmly believes the relationship is not only acceptable. But also desperately needed for their survival the victim feels they would mentally collapse if the relationship ended when she reflected on this recording in her autobiography Patricia, once again stated she was only parroting what the SLA wanted her to but in 1974 Patricia seem to be cemented to the SLA no matter what happened after the Hibernia robbery and the subsequent communique is the FBI reclassified their search for Patricia. She was no longer a captive but a fugitive we'll talk more about Patricia's life in a terrorist cell after this when you're young it can be easy to get into debt and it's even harder to get out of debt.

In April of 1974 20 year-old Patricia Hearst appeared to have cited with her captors The symbionese Liberation Army on April 15th. She helped them commit a bank robbery and steel over $10,000 at first the SLA celebrated this Victory. However, once the adrenaline and excitement wore off Patricia began to see the reality of life as an urban Guerrilla, the nine adult members of the SLA were all crammed into a small. All one-bedroom apartment because they were wanted fugitives. No one could leave the house instead. They continued to run drills and make plans for their next revolutionary strike during this time. Patricia reportedly had a close relationship with fellow SLA member Willie Wolfe other members of the group described them as a couple Patricia has repeatedly denied the existence of this relationship saying wolf sexually abused her. However in the photographs from the Hibernia Bank robbery Patricia was wearing an Olmec monkey pendant that belonged to Wolf. This could indicate that they did have a relationship as other SLA members claimed the SLA had a free love philosophy everyone had sex with each other but as Jeffrey toobin noted in an interview, it was impossible for Patricia to give consent because she was a hostage. He said quote any woman who had sex having been kidnapped and kept in a closet. Closet is being raped regardless of the other circumstances. There is no possible way to say that Patty Hearst consented to sex in the closet if any relationship with wolf existed, it was likely based in Stockholm syndrome coercion and sexual abuse according to trauma psychologist Elizabeth Carl, whenever an abuser shows acts of kindness toward you it shows you some hope that you will survive that combined with the terror of what could happen. Sets the stage for wanting to please the abductor and eventually feeling positive toward the abuser as a way of coping perhaps this explains why Patricia would werewolves pendant in one of the taped communicate as she referred to him as the sweetest kindest man, she'd ever known but in the context of her capture wolf could have garnered that kind of endearment simply by treating her with basic human kindness as opposed to treating her like a political prisoner. Shortly after the Hibernia robbery defries became worried about the police discovering their location. They needed to find a new safe house in San Francisco before they left. They trashed the one-bedroom apartment. They graffitied the walls with taunting messages for the FBI. They wrote that there were clues in the bathroom, but they should find them at their own risk. They dumped documents relating to the planning of the robbery and the keys to the getaway cars in the bathtub dousing them in. Or die cooking spices cyanide crystals and their own urine police discovered the disgusting apartment on May 2nd 1974, but the SLA had already moved the FBI had no further Clues as to where they went by that time the SLA were living in one side of a duplex in a mostly black neighborhood of San Francisco. They thought it would look suspicious to neighbors Having Eight white people living in the area. So once again, they stayed cooped up inside to freeze had friends on the outside bring them food and Necessities. They continued their drills exercising in the house. They needed to be in a condition to fight when the revolution began to freeze lead them in calisthenics target practice and more telling them that the other SLA Splinter cell's around the country were also preparing to fight in reality the SLA consisted only of the nine adults in the duplex in her autobiography. Patricia admitted that at this time she believed to freeze his lies that the SLA was a nationwide movement comprised of many revolutionary soldiers. So she went along with everything. She was told to do exercise stand guard make bombs repeat Patricia reported that she was depressed and miserable during this time, and she wasn't the only SLA member who Felt This Way feeling the cramped quarters and once again paranoid about police. Every to freeze decided they should move again this time. He suggested they travel to Los Angeles defries had grown up in Southern California and new people there who could help them defries divided the nine members into three groups of three to make the long drive to Los Angeles. Patricia was paired with Bill and Emily Harris. They were the only married couple in the SLA and reportedly bickered constantly still the drive was made more bearable. But the potential of their new lives in LA in San Francisco, the police were searching for them everywhere. This was a fresh start. However, when the group saw the house they would be moving into they all had second thoughts. It was a small rundown house with no electricity and one bedroom. There was no hot water and no kitchen. This house was also located in a predominantly black neighborhood. So once again, they rarely ventured outside fear, And it would draw too much attention on May 16th 1974 after a few weeks in La Bill and Emily Harris wanted to go out and buy some food and new clothes for the group Patricia jumped at the chance to go with them and breathe fresh air, but the harrises didn't see Patricia as a strong Soldier and dismissed her Patricia insisted. She was an equal member of the group and deserve to go the decision fell to defries and he ultimately let her join their trip. That day Patricia and the harrises went to several stores before stopping at Mel's Sporting Goods Patricia stayed in the van as a lookout. They were still fugitives from the FBI after all and maintained constant vigilance that day in the parking lot. Patricia's sat in the van with the keys in the ignition and a full arsenal of guns, but she didn't drive away from her captors. This was possibly her best chance to escape but she wrote in her autobiography that she was still too afraid to leave remember that she believed the SLA was a worldwide Network. Even if she fled today, where would she go that they wouldn't find her nearly four months of captivity had transformed her mental state and Patricia didn't need anyone pointing a gun at her to stay put she was kept captive in that van by her own brain while in the store Bill decided to steal a shotgun shell bandolier a cashier saw the theft and Fronted him forcing him out of the store the situation escalated and Bill started fighting the cashier and his boss for other men rushed in to join The Fray they tackled Bill who reached for his gun in the van Patricia heard the chaos and jumped into action. She grabbed a submachine gun from the back seat and started shooting. She fired off 30 rounds of ammunition aiming above the fight shattering the store window when her Gun ran out of ammo. She grabbed another from the van and Shop more rounds eventually the men fled to call the police Bill and Emily ran to the van and they sped away Jeffrey toobin has pointed to this moment as a pivotal turning point in Patricia's capture it signaled her complete transformation. He did not speculate on the cause simply that she was now clearly one of them acting of her own volition. He said quote Here's a woman alone in a van with the key in the ignition and instead of driving away. She fires a machine gun to free her comrades as Patricia and the Harris has fled the scene. They worried the make and model of their van would be reported to police by the store manager. They abandoned the van and stole a car trying to get back to the safe house. But after a few short blocks, the stolen car died, they had to find another they stole a second car but then Then became paranoid what if the owner of this car reported it to the police as stolen they'd be captured. It was no safer than their van. They drove into a neighborhood and saw a van for sale outside a house. Emily went to the door and told the 18 year old boy who answered that she was interested in buying the van, but wanted to test drive it first when the boy came outside Bill pulled a gun on him and forced him to get in the backseat Patricia. Is already inside duck down low the kid was a high school senior named Tom Matthews when Bill told him that the woman he was sitting next to was Patricia Hearst. He felt like he was seeing a celebrity Patricia brag to Matthews about her work with the SLA. She told him that she believed in the SLA as Mission and wanted to help the people. She told him she wasn't in any danger at all and she certainly wasn't brainwashed in case they had a police tail bilaam. Ali and Patricia didn't want to go back to the safe house. So instead they went to a local drive-in movie theater. The SLA had previously arranged this as a backup meeting place if they became compromised Patricia Matthews and the harrises watch two full movies together, but to freeze and the others never showed up to escape possible recognition, they carjacked another car and let Matthews go. They asked him not to call the police. He seemed to be sympathetic to their cause And was impressed by them rather than afraid he kept his word, but they were still worried Matthews might report their newest license plate. So they went out in search of another car Emily and Patricia posed as hitchhikers breaking off from Bill. They knew two women on their own would have better luck getting someone to stop when a man pulled over for them. Emily showed him her gun and hijack the car. They went back and picked up Bill where they'd left him. It was now getting um dark again and they hadn't heard from the other SLA members in over 24 hours. They didn't want to go back to the safe house if the police were following them, but they didn't have another backup plan after the movie theater Emily decided they should drive to Anaheim and stay in a hotel outside of Disneyland. She thought they could blend in among the tourists as it turned out while they headed for safety. The police were on their way to the SLA safe house in Los Angeles the police had discovered. Covered the original SLA van after the shootout at Mel's Sporting Goods. Patricia didn't realize that when they abandon the vehicle the trio had left an unpaid parking ticket on the passenger seat the ticket listed the address where it had been issued. It was the address for their safe house. So while Patricia and the SLA were robbing banks building bombs shooting at people and stealing cars the crime that truly got the police on their case was a traffic Violation but when police arrived on May 17th 1970 for the house was empty the other SLA members had fled to a nearby boarding house after hearing about the shootout on the radio. However, just as defries feared all of those white faces stuck out to the neighbors as did the several guns They carried it didn't take long for the police to find them soon a SWAT team arrived and surrounded The Boarding House the police. Did for the SLA to come outside, but they refused both sides geared up for a standoff when the TV news outlets caught wind of the story. They rushed over to set up cameras. Everyone assumed that Patricia Hearst was inside the boarding house and wanted to be the first to report on her arrest, but Patricia was in Anaheim with the harrises the trio watched the events unfold on TV anxious and nervous for their friends eventually the police. Lise threw tear gas into the house trying to force the SLA out but they still didn't budge instead. They started shooting out the windows at the police the police fired back and had evolved into a massive shootout in her autobiography. Patricia said that as she watched the live broadcast quote the emotional shock was devastating shots rang out and my entire body reverberated as though struck as the firefight. Continued the police escalated their tactics. They once again launched canisters of tear gas into the house. But this time they used Federal 555 Riot tear gas, which was much more potent and flammable Sparks from the S. LA's firing bullets ignited the gas starting a fire in their preparations for war the SLA had moved several cans of gasoline into the house the fuel fed the flames. And soon the house was engulfed still the SLA refused to come out eventually the roof collapsed trapping everyone inside No One survived Patricia watched in horror as most of the SLA died on live television. She no longer saw them as her kidnappers. She thought they were her comrades. The only people in the world who cared if she lived or died Patricia sat silently in the Well room with Bill and Emily Harris grieving the SLA had gone from nine to three members in one day. This was Patricia's chance to escape without retribution. But instead she declared to Bill and Emily Harris. That is the last living members of the SLA. It was up to them to take revenge together. They were going to take down the police coming up. We'll explore Patricia's life after death. You have the suspects fingerprints at the crime scene.

Now back to the story. In May of 1974 the majority of the symbionese Liberation Army died in a standoff with the police their captive 20 year-old. Patricia Hearst was thankfully away from the group at the time of the confrontation. Patricia had watched her captors horrific deaths on live television while holed up in a hotel room in Anaheim, California with the only other surviving members of the SLA Bill and Emily Harris. She told them that they should take revenge. Eng on the LAPD for what they done all throughout her captivity defries told Patricia that the police wanted to kill her now. She had seen that brutality with her very own eyes. She didn't trust any law enforcement agencies Patricia noted in her autobiography that after watching the other SLA members be brutally killed by police. She felt the FBI would shoot her on sight if she attempted to turn herself in after the shootout. Patricia and the harrises knew the police would be looking for them. Once they realized their bodies weren't among the remains of the others. They drove South to Costa Mesa, California and stayed in a motel for 10 days there. They heard of a memorial service for the dead SLA members held at Berkeley led by a woman named Kathy. So Leah Kathy's former. Best friend was Angela Atwood an SLA member who had perished in Los Angeles Kathy publicly spoke out. Support of the SLA is goals seeking an ally Patricia Bill and Emily return to San Francisco and tracked down Kathy. So Leah Kathy agreed to help them and set them up in an apartment. But even with this new goal, Patricia was struggling during this time. She drank heavily. It's not unlikely that Patricia was suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder after watching the SLA shootout on TV psychiatrist tanzeel Ansari reports that many sufferers of PTSD abuse alcohol as a coping mechanism. The Harris is often left Patricia at the apartment by herself, but she never once tried to escape in her autobiography. She said quote. It's simply never occurred to me my fear of the police outweighed my Hatred for the SLA at the same time that Patricia Bill and Emily were trying to form a new organization with Kathy and her friends. Someone tracked them down a journalist named Jack Scott Scott. Wanted to write a book about the SLA. He invited them to a farm that he and his wife had rented in Pennsylvania out of San Francisco. They could find a respite from their fugitive existence. The farm was secluded enough that they wouldn't have to worry about police finding them. In exchange Patricia Bill and Emily would provide exclusive interviews to Scott. But Jack Scott had one rule at the farm. No guns at first Patricia and the harrises were resistant to comply bill was especially angry about it. He insisted that a soldier needed to be armed at all times, but eventually Patricia and Emily talked him into it. They were safe there. The police had no reason to suspect they were living on a farm in, Pennsylvania. Yeah, according to American heiress while in Pennsylvania Patricia brooded over the names of people she wanted to kill she was still hell-bent on getting payback for the murder of her SLA friends, but outside of the Revenge plot Patricia and the harrises seemed happy at the farm. They continued their daily drills. So they would be ready when the revolution came somehow though bill got a BB gun and began Target practicing as a result of breaking the one rule. Jack kicked all three of them out and sent them to live in a house in the Catskills. But while they were taking full advantage of Jack's Hospitality, they weren't offering him what he wanted in return eventually Jack realized he wouldn't be getting any material for his book. So he decided to send them back to California. In the fall of 1974 Patricia Bill and Emily were smuggled to Sacramento to reconnect with Kathy. So Leah and the new SLA they renamed themselves the new world Liberation Front or n WL F among the N WL F members with Steve. So Leah Cathy's brother Steve and Patricia became a couple American heiress noted that Patricia wrote about him quote. He did not try to dominate teach or Demands for me that alone one. My gratitude Steve was a house painter and sometimes took Patricia out on his jobs. She was glad to get out of the house and no one ever recognized her being outside completing a task and hanging out with a guy was almost a return to normalcy. It was a happy time for Patricia. She and Steve began going on dates like a normal couple but a normal couple they were not they had plans to build bombs. Bombs, which required expensive materials as 1974 turned to 1975 the end. Wlf realized they needed money. They were tired of making ends meet by stealing wallets and eating cheap horse meat. They decided to Rob another bank Patricia visited several banks around Sacramento Scouting For the right target. She took notes on the blueprints of the buildings and the way the branch operated. On February 25th, 1975 a little more than a year after Patricia was kidnapped to and wlf members went into the guild Savings and Loan Association in Sacramento and robbed it Patricia and Emily took a bus to the bank picked up the bags of cash. The other members handed them hopped back on the bus and went home without even being noticed but the hall wasn't as big as they'd hoped less than $4,000 it. Even last two months soon. They planned another robbery on April 21st 1975 for and wlf members entered the crocker National Bank in Carmichael, California. The plan was the same as it had been for the other robberies get in get the money and get out leave no clues leave. No casualties. Patricia's role was to drive a getaway car, but during the bank robbery Emily. The harrises gun fired and she accidentally killed a woman Myrna opsahl a middle-aged mother of for the N WL F members fled to Patricia's waiting van frantic Patricia. Didn't know what had happened inside as she drove them away. They told her that Emily had killed a woman and Patricia was now an accomplice to murder the murder haunted the group and they were never quite the same. They had managed to walk away with $15,000 but it was covered in an innocent woman's blood a few months after the robbery the N WL F decided to return to San Francisco Steve and Patricia moved into their own apartment together there Patricia was now no longer living with any of her original SLA captors, but her fear of the FBI kept her from contacting her family or trying to return home. She continued her life of crime. In August of 1975 the N WL F focused their full energies on making pipe bombs Patricia and the SLA had practice making bombs since her kidnapping but she had never actually set one off now. She wanted to on August 7th Patricia and a comrade planted a bomb underneath a police car in San Francisco's Mission District. They were hoping to destroy the police car as revenge for the murder of the SLA members. But the bomb never went off a few weeks later on August 20th, Patricia planted a bomb outside the Marin County Civic Center while Steve placed a second one under a police car. They hope the police would rush out after the first bomb exploded then be killed in the second explosion. Patricia's bomb did go off but Steve's didn't no one was hurt in the meantime the FBI. I started following Kathy so Leah she first caught their attention with the same SLE a memorial service that inspired Patricia and the Harris has to find her though. It took several months for the police to put together a profile on so Leah, they eventually discovered her involvement with the NW LF. She unintentionally led the FBI to Bill and Emily Harris has apartment and then to Patricia's On September 18th, 1975 the authorities found Patricia in her apartment and arrested her. She didn't try to shoot the agents or fight back. She confirmed she was Patricia Hearst and went with them willingly her Strange Life as a revolutionary was finally over at 2:25 p.m. Less than 30 minutes ago. We arrested Patty Hearst and windy Yoshimura. But in police custody Patricia continue to act like an SLA member as she was a squirted inside the courthouse in front of reporters and Spectators she threw up her fist in a revolutionary gesture in her autobiography. She wrote quote. It seemed to me that I was trapped in this nether land of radicals and revolutionaries. There's was the only world I had I did not really know what I believed anymore. She refused to cooperate with the authorities or tell them. Anything about her time with the SLA when Patricia was booked into the San Mateo jail. She listed her occupation as an urban Guerrilla. She wrote letters to Steve so Leah from jail telling him how she couldn't wait for them to be together and talking about the fascist Pig police. Patricia was charged with armed bank robbery and the use of a firearm in a felony. These charges were exclusively related to the 1974 Hibernia Bank robbery. It was the only crime the police had concrete evidence for in preparation for the trial. She was given a mental fitness test according to her autobiography one psychiatrist. Dr. Lifton ruled. She was emotionally and mentally impaired to a significant degree sad hopeless emotionally distressed and expressing a silent Cry for Help. He also diagnosed her as suffering from coercive persuasion, which is the more formal term. Term for brainwashing Patricia noted in her autobiography that lift and told her quote one does not revert back with the snap of the fingers upon being released this might explain her behavior and resistance to Authority after being arrested. She was still in the mindset of an SLA agent because their beliefs had been drilled into her day in and day out for the last year and a half though. She had been a victim of psychological manipulation. Patricia was deemed mentally fit to Seed to trial so a court date was set the proceedings began on February 4th, 1976 two years to the day after she was kidnapped. The courtroom was packed with Spectators and reporters. Everyone wanted the scoop on what really happened to Patricia Hearst according to her autobiography more than 300 reporters came to cover the event. But most of them couldn't fit inside the courtroom Patricia's lawyer. Our F Lee Bailey presented her as a brainwashed prisoner of war he blamed everything that she had done on the fact that she had been kidnapped. He used examples of brainwashed Korean War pows. However, the prosecution argued that Patricia was a willing member of the SLA they pointed to her recorded communicate has the Mel's Sporting Goods shootout and submitted pages from the book about the SLA that Patricia was writing they called Emily and Bill Harris. as Witnesses against her Tom Matthews the teen who had been held hostage alongside Patricia when he was carjacked after the Mel's Sporting Good shootout testified that she was a willing radical at that time when Patricia took the witness stand the prosecutor asked why she saved the harrises from Mel's instead of leaving them Patricia replied that it was an instinct that came from her drills with the SLA the prosecution also presented the Olmec monkey pendant from Willie wolf as proof that Patricia had not been coerced. It was found in her purse when she was arrested over a year after Wolf's death if she was truly afraid of him considered him to be her kidnapper and rapists. Why did she keep a gift from him it threw everything into doubt her trial lasted over a month during this time Patricia received death threats and the media remained convinced. She was guilty on March 20th. 1976 the jury agreed with the papers Patricia Hearst was found guilty pleasure. Campbell Hearst has been convicted on two counts of bank robbery and possession of a firearm to commit a felony. The verdict was reached after only 12 hours of deliberations by her jury of seven women and five men on April 12. She was sentenced to 25 years for the Hibernia Bank robbery and 10 years for the use of a firearm in that robbery. It was devastating to Patricia and her family, but after she underwent a psychological study the judge decided to lessen the sentence on September 24 1976. Her sentence was reduced to seven years Bill and Emily Harris were eventually sentenced to eleven year to life prison terms. Although they only served about eight years of it. Patricia couldn't bear the fact that they had received only a few more years than her on their sentence when Been involved in all of the same crimes but also kidnapped her her family couldn't bear it either they decided to appeal her case to President Jimmy Carter on January 30th 1979. He commuted her sentence Patricia was freed two days later after serving a total of 21 months in prison the vilification the brutalization of her can never Escape. I'm sure from her heart and Certainly that those who were very close to her. And in 2001 President Bill Clinton issued Patricia a full pardon for her crimes today the public consensus is that Patricia suffered from Stockholm syndrome, but at the time of her trial the condition was basically unheard of the term itself was only coined six months before she was taken by the SLA. There's still debate among psychologists about whether or not Stockholm syndrome is real. It's not listed in the DSM-5. The American Psychiatric association's classification of mental disorders some psychologists believe it's more of a media buzz word than an actual psychological syndrome, but the connection persists Patricia's kidnapping and crimes remain practically synonymous with the diagnosis.

In her memoir, she said she was brainwashed by the group, which wanted to ""depose the capitalist system of Oppression."" Now, a podcast called Not guilty by Sami Nye and Vanessa Richardson is digging into Hearst's life after her kidnapping, looking at how she became a ""self-described urban Guerrilla"" and committed crimes with her captors, including a 1974 bank robbery, per the San Francisco Chronicle. In the podcast, they look at how Hearst was able to break away from her captors and join her own cause, ultimately pledging her life to the SLA. ""She gained sympathy for and from her captors developing Stockholm syndrome, eventually, she joined her kidnappers cause and pledged her life to the SLA,"" says Richardson. ""She didn't believe any of what she said she did whatever she was told so she would survive before we get into Patricia. Just a quick disclaimer. Vanessa is not a licensed psychologist or psychiatrist, but she's done a lot of research for this show. Thanks Sammy."" Among other things, the podcast looks at how Hearst was able to break away from her captors and join her own cause,",0.2140468227424749,0.13377926421404682

Okay, I'm whispering because I'm not alone. I'm here with my best friend. Hi get closer to me. Okay. Hi, I'm Jonathan. Yeah, we okay. Just a quick story. Yeah about why we're here together there wasWell, once upon a time we found out we were really good at talking to each other and then we after that found out that we're really good at talking to each other in front of other people. Yeah, absolutely and most people I would say like 90% of people have a really good time when we are talking hmm. There are definitely been people who were like, oh I got to go. Yeah, not everyone's a fan but then I don't want that life anyways, so as I started thisA podcast like it's always been my plan to have Jonathan on an episode and but here's the surprise. It's never been my plan to have him be on this episode that where he asked me questions. Yeah. Yeah. I really decided I was going to take the Take the Wheel on this one. I kind of thought I would be asking you questions because you can okay, but not yet. Okay. Well, I just think not everybody. They know so I'm talking about some of you do know because I've had you either DM me like who is that guy about the guy in my Instagram stories or you just already know John? That's just how it is already know Jonathan. Okay. I am the Jonathan that she worried vomited on a few episodes ago. Yes. Yeah, and you may know him as John but I don't know you was John. I really there's no consistency to who calls me which okay, and I don't honestly, I don't see a difference. Don't understand that there is a difference there. I don't know that like it's uncomfortable for a lot of hetero, presenting men to call me a three syllable name. Thanks a lot more lung I don't know is as just like, you know a referring to a guy by their last name, but then they also don't like calling me by my last name either. So it just ends up being John. It is more of like a bro, dude John and flows with the no syllabic. Jonathan comes across to a little too soap opera. Yeah, you know nothing. Yeah, I used to use that when I play Barbies a lot as like the guy the gay guy there are always bad, but actually no my Jonathan go to was always when my Barbie was like rich and famous and she'd be like, oh, I'll just have Jonathan take care of that and it was always like her. Yes. Yes. It was fun to shout Jonathan into like the next room. Yeah. Nana's like what you know one here live no one here has that name? Yeah, she knew I was weird that there was never a time where she was like, I wonder what that means. Yeah. She know not to question that yeah, um don't want to get into that. No, that's a can of worms. Just like nod and smile. Yeah, he truly enjoyed it. So that one of the main things the reasons why we're also together today is because we just came back from an event. Oh my boy. Oh my golly with out Central, Oregon and it was full. Yeah. That's okay. Central Oregon is doing like a ton of stuff this weekend. And that's like winter Pride Fest. Yes and out Central Oregon is like the local lgbtqia like Association of like, yeah, it's one like Outdoors it cool Fun Time Event times and it like it's also just to get people to like draw the queer Community together. Okay. It was amazing. I've never done anything like that before. I actually haven't either. Yeah, and it was like a a panel of queer athletes. So there was Joey who is a coach at Redmond high. He does strength training and PE. There was Molly who is a trans does like bike racing. I would say like a like a relative cyclist like yes your honor of all things. I'm about to just I'm should have I probably already have betrayed how little I know about anything else. Same yeah, and then there was the illustrious Patagonia. Yes when Wiley yeah Patty gonna hurt himself. Um, yeah. It was what I what I liked about it is that I got to stand in a room and like look to you and I literally said in my head, like look how far we've come. I'm like what? Yeah, when me and Jonathan met we were like till the origin of the French a little bit will go like the fast round. So that is nine years to cover. So for those of you who have heard the story, you're probably overwhelm. Like don't say the whole thing. I have to have a meeting don't make me sing. Yeah, you have a lunch break Iran. You got a meeting to get to you have some there's no less traffic than you thought there'd be on this commute that you're on and you're like I am about to get to my destination and I already know the story. Yes. Yeah. So the short version is that we were both in college and we both said yeah. Sure. I'll go on a missions trip. Mmm. And we both went to Baptist University. Yep sister schools. I in Arkansas Ouachita Baptist University and I in Riverside, California, California Baptist University. Yeah, what how does one find one's way from a Baptist University hmm to out Central Oregon listening to a panel of yeah queer folks talk about what it means to be queer athletes. Yes. Well that is you know, that's not what we're going to talk. No, that's a whole chapter in the book later. Like I said before. Yeah, and you'll be excited when it's the audiobook to because then we'll both be reading that chapter. Yeah, you know, I mean kind of like Megan Mullally and her husband's name. I don't think Offerman. Oh, yes. Okay, like read their audio book together. I know that's so sweet. I know. Um, so I just realized it was kind of like a shocking moment to go back to 2011 in my head and oh dear be like Don't know. I don't think I would have said no to an event like this tonight, but I think I would have felt a lot more like I'm observing anthropology rising and I'm I'm truly like an outsider and I don't feel like one at all. I didn't feel like one at all tonight, even though I'm not really I guess I don't really know what if I'm a part of the lgbtq community or not. But like I don't really feel like I'm in I definitely feel like my role is supposed to be a lie, and I will die in a lie. Hmm. Okay, okay. So just tell us tell that listeners, especially the ones in Indonesia and South. Oh Africa. Okay. Yeah. Well said South Australia, but you guys to shout out to you guys. Yes. We love you people who don't know you who are our International listeners or just people who are in eastern Oregon and they're out there and they're trying to live it up and burns on their they're like, I live in Burns, but I guess I'd like to know somebody and they're listening to podcasts. Tell them about yourself a little bit. Okay. Well, I mean, where do you even start, you know start at the beginning? I'm going to get start stop your top and then you ended your bottom. Yeah. That's wow. We can't go from a gay event to say not but okay, so I guess if I were to introduce myself and I am I would say I'm from Alabama went to a Baptist University majored in English like focused in linguistics, and also did a double major and Christian Studies and like really zoomed in on Hebrew and Greek and like getting into the original languages, especially in the Hebrew literary criticism was my jam. I moved to China I was a missionary for two years had kind of an identity crisis stayed there for two more years because why not? Yeah, and then just kind of found myself like where I am now just like I don't know kind of drift in just seeing what's going on around and just enjoying being around people and I think that part of my work is to do some heavy lifting thinking for people and I really enjoy doing that and that's what I like to talk about. And that's why I like to do and yeah, I don't I don't know. I mean like I play the recorder now, yes because I can't bassoons are too expensive. I like to cook. I like to wear a cloak every single day if I can get away with it. Yep. That's who I am. That's who you are. Just a quick like A little like pretty inconvenient. Well, what I want to say right now is that Jonathan is gay and he's single and he's single. Wow. I mean just expose me and I'm I'm I don't know a lot about grinder. I've seen screenshots, but I don't like it and nobody likes grinder. No and so my I just want to put it out there if there's anyone listening to this going that sounds like a guy I could be With yeah, and you're a guy and you're just sitting there being just as because how am I sitting in my closet with my best friend who's literally the smartest man? I know like no offense to Alex Trebek, but this is the smartest man. I know and he's the coolest man. I know and he has really really good smelling hair and he knows yeah, he and he knows how his way around a kitchen. He knows his way around a body. He knows his way around the woods. He knows his way around foreign. Trees, like what don't you know your way around nothing that seems important to this conversation. So I just a mini plug for Glenn. Can I just like move on? Oh, yeah. I'm hot. I'm so sorry. Okay. Um, so I just wanted to say that a little tiny commercial. He didn't pay me to do it. He will eventually on his wedding day. Just let me like a check probably like I probably pay you just directly in Gold. Oh PayPal also, um, nope. Oh grams of gold. Grams of gold I except in a chain. I was thinking like a little gram bars like you can buy a gram bars at a time like a fun tchotchke for the mantelpiece. I like that. So Jonathan has written questions. I do I have two pages worth and he wrote them and printed them out our paper right now. Okay. Wow, it's like you're really here. I'm really proud of that. Yeah. Well, so he's gonna ask me questions because I guess I can tell you why. Okay. So one of my favorite things is when I'm hanging out with two people who know each other really well like better than I know other than like, they're old friends and I just get to like wow so cool to be around old friends. Who doesn't love to do that, but I love it specifically when those people find out something new about each other that they didn't know before and I get to watch two people who've known each other for a really long time learn something new about each other and it's like I got to be there for that, you know, and so what I was doing the other night was I was like they're questions that I want to ask Brooklyn that I've never asked her before and when you do known somebody for nine years, it really doesn't matter how deeply you've known somebody when you known for nine years. It becomes really difficult to think of things that you haven't asked them before but then also like the only other people in the world, I feel like I knows well is Brooklyn are people that I literally went to like Elementary School with so as I've like been thinking about these things like there are some good questions. I could ask her so I'm gonna we're gonna have a warm-up round. Okay, and then we're going to get to the really meaty stuff my love meet you do and then I like sandwiches. I like Oreos like that. Like I like to end where I started that's probably a little bit of my like biblical studies thing. So we're going to lighten it back up. Yeah, so that like you listener you don't get like you don't end on some things like who have heavy lifting. Goodbye you guys and then and then like man, I gotta go straight from the Into what you know, so then we're going to end it on some lighter notes as well. Mmm, yum yum yum, Daddy give it to me and your mother figure out why I had to print this out because I did a little research for the first question. Okay and what I want I want a heart a hot take here. Okay? Okay. So I was looking back on the mega stars of the 90s. I've been listening to a lot of like older Celine Dion a lot of older Mariah Carey Dolly Parton is a Mainstay. She can't really be relegated. Led to a decade. No, no. No. I'm she's she has no beginning and she has no end apparently, right? Like where did she come from the mountains of Appalachia? Nobody comes from there. So okay. I was like I've been looking through specifically these people we have what what interested me in the 90s is that it was common for people to cover other people's work on a major studio album. When's the last time you saw that? Hmm. Okay. So we have Mariah Carey in 1993. She covered Harry nilsson's without you but on that very same album, which was music box. She had Dream Lover and hero like two of her biggest hits ever. Okay, but like I can't live if Lee booty butt out you was on there. Okay, that wasn't hers Kenley Kenley. Only Whitney Houston covered. I will always love you in 1992 while Dolly herself had released an album called Great Balls of Fire in I know it's like just tons of covers. Yes, who does that anymore? Yes, Willie Nelson's Greatest Hit was an Elvis song. Celine Dion what I did not know. Yeah, uh-huh Celine Dion covered natural woman just before she peeked in Fame and then again in 2003, she covered I Drove all night, which is Cyndi Lauper song. I'm pretty sure I'm probably wrong share often covered songs on major Studio albums Madonna covered American Pie in 2000 member that yeah, I did. Okay. So thousand was a good year like the list goes on. But now what happened to people putting covers on major Studio albums. It's gone. We have cover bands and if you completely reimagine a song that's also okay, but you don't see like Underground a covering that much sure but sampling, right but conversely we are obsessed with rebooting old series. Oh remaking old things but when it comes to music people will people take offense to a successful artist covering. Somebody else's song. I mean you see Adele With Love Song on her album 21, and we absolutely do not talk about that. So what do you think is going on here? Wow, like emotionally culturally spiritually sort of asking me like, what's why is this change? Hmm. We are we are obsessed with remaking old stuff. But yeah comes to Major Artistry making anything. It's like if you do that, I'm gonna freak out like Adele We do not I don't I don't listen to Love Song by Adele. No. No, I don't either don't talk about it. I feel kind of like somebody's probably gonna hear that we talked about it. We're gonna get in trouble. Hmm. Maybe this is I've to one thought is not backed up by science and one is it backed up entirely by science? Okay. Great, you've already done research it just now in my head as a scientist and my own right for my phone small sciences that I've studied the small Sciences. You probably know about them. I would say the internet no offense to the internet. Thank you for being my friend. You're a pal. No, so I the internet. Made everything so much more personal that I almost think anthropologically that it took a long time for someone to sit back and watch like their music be covered by someone that they're like, well I know much about them they seem like nice girl good Canada girl, let her cover my things. Yes, and you're like, I'm you know, I'm Dolly I'm from the mountains let her do her thing because I'm gonna do my thing and they just hear about it and they forget about it because it happened at breakfast. But when it's the internet you have to hear about it 26 times a day become so personal and so like Over done it's over quicker, but I think that going into someone and taking their whole copying their whole living room set up essentially would be like, okay everyone knows my thing like the back of their hand. Why would you copy it when then it was almost like what's that quote about the tide lifting all the ships? I have no Rising tide raises All Ships. Okay, so it's like as as I lift you up, so You know what? I mean? Like you can lift me up like as You Raise Me Up. Yes, so I can stand on mountains stand on mountains. So that's my anthropological one. My that sounded like the silly one, but that was the science one. My like it's an even hotter like spicy or take that we are trying to do this without telling anybody. I think it's happening and we don't know about it because I think people are listening because you brought up Ariana Grande and she has a Along with a little bit of a said samples. Yeah, I think we sample without telling anybody we sampled because I like I've really gone. Mmm. Well, no, I'm sure somebody knows it's probably in writing somewhere but you don't you know, you're not on your like. Oh gotcha. Dude I'm saying so it's like there are like bits and pieces in a song but and that's fine. But when the whole song is the vibe of another song and you don't talk about it like Ariana Grande's good night and go go is I mean, that's Imogen Heap. Entirely I should not have brought up Ariana Grande. I don't know anything. You don't need to know anything. The people know the things. Yes, they do and that's fine. I just don't see Imogen Heap on on there and that's okay. But if you're going to go image and he just do the whole song like go for it and like give me that full moment of you. Just loving the song. I think Miley Cyrus is a great job of this where she just like sings other people's songs, and she's like Chinaman singing Arctic Monkeys get you Do it. She's not like I'm gonna slip it into my little tune. Mmm. She just does the whole thing and then Arctic Monkeys are like, thank you Miley. Yeah, like as much as you hate my li XI Shi zhai. She has my respect. Okay. Okay. That's my thought. Okay. I love that. Okay, we're going to go into the next question. Okay. I want you to put your mind into public school. Yeah teachers. Mmm. There are certain archetypes represented by public school teacher. I'm talking Elementary Middle High. And if you were going to be a public school teacher not basing this off of the subject that you would want to teach but there are certain. Okay, so like coaches mail coaches always teach history and health and then they're like, there's like certain personality that's tied up in that for me. I would be a middle school English teacher why every gay man you've ever met probably Had to keep a journal for his middle school English teacher and probably in that journal came out to that middle school English teacher. Yeah, and you've highlighted this I didn't notice this about myself, but I have this ability to get people to tell me their deepest darkest. Right? Right. Yeah, my my Uber and Lyft drivers like oh my God, like I get out of there and it's like wow, I really hope that his wife gets through this. Like, I'm actually his wife's side in this. Yeah. So when you consider the archetypes that public school teachers represent, what do you think? you would be Hmm. I I have always seen myself as like a theater teacher because I feel like my body shape is very inviting to like, I don't look like I'm better than anybody else in the room. I'm I take up weird chunk of space and I had to I knew this only because two moments occurred in my life where like stars aligned I was in a play and I had to dress up like we'll just Real weird and then when I saw High School Musical For the First Time The like theater teacher in that it was who I looked like in that play, but I remember when I dressed up like that and that play everyone went like this is just right for you. Like you have a bird in your hair. You have a shawl on your clothes just switched to and fro who knows what's happening underneath there. There's just like movement. There's like fat has sway, you know, and mine did and I think in order to be able to tell everybody like Like get your confidence out and care how tiny it is. If it's just a shriveled-up little little old dill pickle get it out. Put it on the desk will gherkin and get ready. Like that's who acts who woke me up. And so I would love to be that person but also, I think I'm not that person. That's like you'll never be like me but just get used to it. It just shows them like you can do this and probably if you feel like you can't do anything. This is something you can do like maybe Maybe like Professor Stockman is like really trying to get you to expose yourself in your English class, maybe coach so and so in algebra is and and history or just really putting the pressure on you can come into theater and I can be like put on this silly mask and like give me your best Madonna like we're just doing that today. Yeah, like my one of the best moments of my life is I remember going up to my theater teacher my Drama teacher I Yes in public school, mr. C and telling him. Hey, I want to do a skit but I have to say the word direction it can I say it is that bad he went I love the word erection. Oh and I said what he was like, you know what you probably think I'm all old and then he sat down at the piano and literally saying My Humps no joke. He just did the rap part. He was like I met a girl down at the Disco. She said hey, I know I'm looking at your like wait. Well I'm saying geography and China to My Humps with swords with swords We did that my ears got so hot right now instantly. So thank you. Mr. C I would be a Drama teacher million percent. I see you in a black turtleneck. Yes, like a black skirt, huh opaque black Hosiery like the like black shoes that have like the one strap across the top know what I'm talking about. Jane's yeah and your yes, exactly and then like your hair up in a bun. Yes. It's sort of like Steve Jobs. Yes, but that's my that it's like Steve Jobs had a baby with a stripper and it was me. I'm not saying anything what you can't say is that I'm just dumbfounded exactly. I love it. Oh my gosh. Okay. Let's see. Hmm. Okay. Hmm. Yep. Okay. This is actually something you didn't know. Oh that Brooklyn doesn't know what these questions are. I don't know if I if I made that very clear at the beginning but the next one I have is why do you dislike chocolate objectively? You should like it hmm fats sugars antioxidants. I'm thinking purely from like oh and health organism. Mmm point of view got it where drawn to fats and sugars and antioxidants and chocolate at caffeine. Hmm virility. Apparently it makes you so horny. That's what you remember like. That's why they mix that's why they did it. Right like they it was like, yeah, he make it for the king and the Hand get so homey. Oh, yeah, so it's got everything. So, um objectively. Yeah, you should like it and but you consistently haven't and I don't think we've ever just like really nailed down y-yeah. We've sort of been like I dropped the nail and you're like should we hammer it in and I'm like not right now you're right, right. I'm gonna say this my audience doesn't know yet that I don't like chocolate because I do intermittently. It's very confusing thing. Most people who are like I hate bananas aren't like but I love them in a you know know right? No thanks to bananas. My cilantro haters out there. It's not like you're going to sometimes be like sprinkle that on me. Dad. I'm in the mood for some soap lettuce, you know, so chocolate to me reminds me of the way that people must feel when they eat cilantro though. In that sometimes I eat it and it tastes like soap it like chocolate. Yeah to me chocolate. I've learned to let kind of like it that because of mochas but I can eat some chocolate like like like in a pancake a half a pancake that's like chocolate chips or a little cookie or like a fake Oreo time, you know, but yeah sure. I'm mostly relying on a thick dose of icing to get me through that. Yeah. Um, so yeah, I don't know. I think my brain has like a switch or sometimes. It's like chocolate is good right now and then it switches over and it's like soap. That's that why you can't stop you're having you're eating Brooklyn you're confused and your shower you're eating your body wash because I also do have I've had body washes that were very almost like taste me. I'm Tasty and I didn't do it somebody works. Yeah, but even growing up like Suave would have ones that I was like yum is that Apple guy have that apple apple moment in the shower? Yeah. Otherwise, I don't know. I probably gonna have to get my brain studied after I die, right? You don't even have to wait until you're dead. They can do like scans. And so I've heard I don't know. It's like really to get into the mush of it all I should probably not be here anymore because what if they like Flicka thing and that was my that was my flick or and you took my flick away. Yeah, and also like another thing you probably don't know about Brooklyn is that she took a class? I did I did. I had a class at CBU called the history of chocolate, which I think it's the history of coffee and chocolate now, maybe but Professor skubick doctor skubick. I'm so sorry. Um, this cubes he taught me all about chocolate I caught on to his love for dark chocolate milk a cow. Nibs, and because that's not a sweet and Brooklyns not a huge fan of like no, I'd rather have like it was history of cheese. I would have died on the table the turkey turkey board next rev Dr. Pepper. I'm out. Okay, I would be I've been drunkenly only soda. Yeah. That's my that's why I'm saying, I don't think you see I didn't know that about you. Oh, that's my baby. That's my baby daddy. So this is whores of all sodas. That's the daddy goat Bay. Dr. Pepper. Yes. Wait, so when you said you're out you meant like you want in I would be dead. Oh, okay. I thought you meant like I'm out like I'm Never Gonna Cancel. Oh, is this our cover? I'm out. No, no, no, okay. Okay. So yeah, that's my only one. Yeah. Okay. So, okay. Well that's good to know and like so and the reason I brought that up is because it's like it's not like you haven't tried and I've tried and it's kind of one of those things like going when somebody's like so well educated on a thing and still turns away from Mmm, that it kind of blows. It's like well then am I wrong for liking it like when someone like takes a class on it and gives it everything she's got right and she's still like yes, I studied the Bill of Rights and I hate the law. I'm no rights. Nobody needs these. Okay. So that was the warm-up round. How you feeling? I'm like warm. I'm a hot. Okay. So now we're going to play a game of word association. Okay. So how that works is I say something you instantly say the first word. Word or short phrase that comes to mind. I'm not cooking and for our out-of-town listeners, I'll be listing some local Bend stuff. Okay. This will also be a warm-up and beginning and then get more serious as we go. I'm ready. Okay coffee. Mmm cold brew cap. Yummy South sister. I don't want to go there shevlin Newport Greenwood 20 love it. I knew you were gonna do that. There's a there's a road and bend it. Because so one of the things that Brooklyn like knows about me is that I can't remember any road names know and like I moved here because we're going to answer first of all second of all as she was like showing me around town. She was like this road has several names shoveling Newport Greenwood 20. So I that like I think it's been what six? I don't know how many years ago either. Okay. So potatoes fried movies all of them D&D wizard Trump yucky. Family money. I want it God. Please marriage, please job have it. Okay. So the reason why I did that is that a lot of times when people stall in that game like when you're not when you don't spit it out, that stall is like, oh, I've got to think of something like mmm to say that's more acceptable my initial thoughts. So do you want to dive into that because The first one that you stalled on was God, huh? Yeah, I don't know. What was I don't know what my initial thought was. Yeah. I think my word was going to be no, but I don't like a great experiment. Yeah, I mean so like if if you didn't catch on in the beginning when we said that we both went to baptist universities and then like wow now we are at this queer panel for athletes. It might be a little complicated, right? Yeah, Faith Journey isn't just linear and easy times now and I remember like one of the diagrams that we did and when I spiritual formation classes was the professor like did the scribble on the board like your journey isn't letting her and but the scribble was kind of going upward again time and it's like, you know, I think that might have been wrong too. Yeah, that was an assumption that it will always get better. Yep. Yeah, and then Marriage, he stalled on what did I say for marriage? I said like, please please please I mean because it sounds so good. But also my thought I think my initial thought was kind of like probably not or like how how do you summarize like not not my priority or like I would rather have other things. Yeah, I just would like I the way I summarize it. No, that was the cap the way I summarize it for people for not everybody because this is not everybody but if you've seen the movie The Greatest showman and at the end you Jackman or Jonathan says Jack human I sure did. I was so sleepy, you know, the limbs worth brothers are going to the here Jack human referring to Chris and Liam. Was it Hemsworth? I think that's I don't know anymore its limbs Worth to us seems worth and Jackie a given set of you down. So Hugh Jackman at the end as this character PT Barnum chooses his family like over the circus and I think everyone was like, I'm I cries. I love it. I feel the same very Bjork of them, but I was sitting there going well shit. I think I'd pick the circus mmm, but I probably that's problematic because I would pick my family. I think I do have a loyalty. A high amount of loyalty but I would just I think if I had to pick if I could pick between the two roads at that point in time, I think I picked the circus. Yeah, I mean that's complicated because he already had the family right it was sort of like so if it choose between though we don t have a family or like go in the circus. Yeah, right. You would right now, I'd be circus for you right now. If I could. Yeah, the two roads diverged in a yellow wood and I'm going on the circus down. Hello. She went Frosty on us. Okay. Um, let's see. So I'm going to ask Brooklyn. This is for you listeners. I'm going to ask Brooklyn some interrelated questions that like they sound kind of generic but they directly concerned the things that I admire most about Brooklyn and so I don't first of all, I don't think I've ever told you like I admire this about you. I don't think I think of like kind of we talked about it, right but it's hard for me to just like straight-up compliment somebody yeah because it's hard for me to receive them. So I really don't like Compliment others to other people. Absolutely. I told someone else about you and how you're good at this and I'm like hmm. Hmm. Yeah, but yeah, it's I have a problem being direct with those kinds of things. So, um, you know in the words of Dolly this is this is my question. I'm normally not this obsessed with Dolly but I've just been really sort of that. She's with us right now. I think to I've got my eyes closed. I'm trying to tune into that frequency right now and Ali and I can feel dolly in this. Closet I can too. Okay, so in the words of Dolly with all your you do your attitude just seems to be so good. How do you keep it? Hmm. Brooklyn's a very busy person and I am over here working like a full-time job and then I work a full day on a Saturday and I like crumble to Pieces. Mmm and Brooklyn the whole time. I've known her has always worked like so many different jobs at once and has Always been there and present and genuine at the same time. How do you do that? Wow? It's one of those times here. We are where I'm hearing like that sounds good, but I don't think I'm that way. Well you think wrong yeah, thank you. So my answer for now like ask me again in five years. Okay. Okay. My answer feminine. Okay, tasty re please. Remember I feel I feel kind of Like I have a responsibility. This is kind of a weird deep thing, but we'll maybe that's what this will get to talk about it another time more but I feel like a deep responsibility that I'm Not only living my life for me, but that I'm living it for everyone else that I love so that their lives can be okay too. And that's a part of my personality but it's also really super deeply ingrained in me because of how I was raised like my grandmother lived her life for Betterment of other people like never was she like, you know what I need today like and she should have been she maybe should have said that a few times but I feel like I'm living my life for her now. And so I know that's like a huge Grand big scale thing. Like it's a big question. Well, yeah, if you took out my brain stem you'd be like, oh here it is. That's what it says right here. Like that's what she's doing and it's informing a lot of the other choices. She makes so I am on some level. I know I'm like, what's the right thing to do? Do and that's just totally Molly Wagner like me. I'm so slithering that I'm like, what do I want to do? And then the Gryffindor part of me is all her that's just like what's the best for all people? What's the best for the ones that you love and I'm pretty pretty lucky that and I'm pretty stubborn in my luck. I think that I've picked I found really good people to love like you and I've I've chosen to keep them. So it's a lot easier to show up for people because you just also want to be there. Yeah. And that's a word that I heard you use the other day that chosen. I have chosen to love these people and I think that that was something that I really admired to because a lot of times in our present culture. It's like well whoever happens to be in front of me. Yeah. It's the one that gets the attention and what I don't see a lot is people saying like nope, whatever it is. I'm going to love that person. Yeah, and do you think Is that something that you also tribute to? Yeah, I mean, I know it's me to like I know I am I am her and she is me I'm not just like walking around like trying to channel this other person like I do things and I look down and be like, I look in the mirror and see me and her you know, and I'm like, oh cool. I did not know I got to still have that. I think I'd you know, you just feel like you're your own person all the time and you're like I suck and then you're like, well, I don't always suck but it's also attributed to so many good people. But yeah. don't there's nothing in me that thinks like Like I'm just forced it. I have to have these friendships because they're right here and I just have to it's like I have chosen very carefully who I get to love but also the people that I get to love aren't easy to love like you're not using for love like nobody is nobody is but that's that's my favorite part about it because I don't know what easy to love even feels like ever. Yeah. I don't know that feeling of like like love to me isn't just like the first five minutes. So that's what nine years feels like with somebody where it's like It's never going to be easy, but that's the coolest part because that's what family is. That's what like that's what I'm looking for. All the time is someone who's going to still like I have friends who I don't live around anymore and some of them I think I wish I could communicate and like talk to all the time and but I have like a pretty intense tunnel vision and we'll talk about that at another point in time. Like I move on very easily from people that I walk away from I'm it is easier for me to have The people like to want to be around people I can go and drive and like sit with in my car and also have Del Taco with and all that. We're in your closet right in my closet. And so I'm very drawn to being like physically near people and but there are people who are my friends and I am not easy to love in that way. I just walked out like okay by Pontius Pilate like I wash my hands of this friendship and they like chase me down. Yeah, so I'm just putting it out there for all the friends who still text me and look out for me and like ask me. Doing and send me videos of you like your kids and like my friend Liz friendless is kids. I've only seen a couple times and they call me Aunt Cookie and she they send me video. They ask how I'm doing and like she it's because her and her husband are so good. I like showing them me, you know, I mean, that's just cool. That's just oh my gosh, that's so cool. And I fall apart whenever I get like a Instagram video and I like how that cookie and I'm like, okay. Yeah. Yeah. I just immediately start hitchhiking. Going to Southern California. So yeah, I think so to me and this is like very much my like Hebrew literature background coming out to me. I think the core of loving someone is listening and remembering. Hmm. And I think that's something I admire a lot and you too because that to me is like the most important thing. That's what I try to do for everybody and it's just I think that when you meet somebody else who Whose values align like yours and mine a line like that? I think yeah, it's never like you can't ever let put the easy stamp like that one's easy. But like and I mean like our whole relationship. You can't just like stamp a whole relations being easy. Nope, but I think that like if if my friendships and all these people that have chosen to keep around if I put them on a gradient I would say that ours is more on the easy side. Yes. Oh total is more toward that. A difficult time where I like you when you like cooking with you taste better, like driving with you long distance sounds better singing with you harmonizes better. There's is what I brought up in the last episode where I talked about friendship DNA. There are just people that you have this like DNA with that you're like like almost everyone else around you is like, okay guys, we get it like you have it. You have the spice your salt and pepper ago record a fucking album, you know, like that's that's kind of how it feels. He's with some people. And yeah, I do think that there is a gradient and then there is like a thickness to the one end of it and I'm like that's definitely how I feel with you and that's how I feel with like very few people but it's like thank God I feel with only few people because then I would never get to be with anybody how exhausting to oh my gosh. Yeah. It is BET like some people are like, I only have a few friends and I'm just like, oh my gosh, that was probably one of the best gifts ever to have a few close friends because like Then what else did Golden Girls teach us? Yeah. Well, so like when I lived in China and part of the first two years, I was a missionary and I was having to raise funds and I had to sustain a matrix of about a thousand people and I'm not kidding like it was people from my home church people that I like family friends. I graduated high school with OBU people. So like a college folks and then like, All of these then there's like this professional Matrix that I had to maintain and then I'm like China. I don't know if you knew this Chinese very densely populated. It's something like I've got this Matrix going as well and I was able to keep it up but my goodness that's exhausting. Yeah, you know, and so that's why you showed up with really like bloodshot eyes and you were like help me. Yeah. Absolutely. I yeah my thing when like all of my time in China came to an end it was like How ridiculous like why would I go anywhere but wherever Brooklyn is, I mean if you had been in Alabama, I may have been like I got ya I gotta go. Do you want to move to bend together? Like I Googled organ sounds good. Let's go. Yeah, I get that. Um, so yeah, I'm with you on that like when those few relationships fall on the easier side of the gradient, like that's when it's like just Just appreciate them. If they're they're like get over your beef. If you got beef cheek beef to get through your beef fix it like fix if you can because it's like a treasure and I know what it's like to be a stubborn like a know-it-all once what they want kind of person and if the person that you love happens to be the same way and you you get the beef suddenly look down here like there's beef coming out of both of us. Yeah. Just I I don't know a situation obviously is a big blanket statement, but that's what I do and that's what podcasts are ya someday. We'll take collars. Oh, yeah. I thought you meant like like, oh no, we're going to the priesthood. Sorry, like not gonna happen or just like kinky stuff. Mmm. Yep. I don't know if I'm into that. I haven't tried it. No. Okay. So okay, we're going to like move into the like the other part the other side of the cookie love it. Okay. Um, yeah, we're back to the chocolate Oreo that can handle it. I can handle it. Yeah, so if it's HBO left a lot of loose ends when it comes to Game of Thrones. Yes, and they probably did it on purpose. Hmm and probably also because they're very rushed and probably also because George RR Martin can't finish he can't who could true. Yeah like JRR Tolkien true kind of and he's like, hey Chris, can you just like fix this? Yeah. Okay. So anyway the point I'm getting to is of the Loose Ends that they've left on Game of Thrones What? Or spin-offs. Would you like to see to tie up some of those loose ends? I want a whole show on being a lady night. She I can't believe like she was so ready to answer especially like not miss a beat. Okay a whole show on a lady night all I want to know I want to watch Brienne of Tarth have her I understand that she and if you've never watched Game of Thrones do it, there's go ahead. You know, I keep some people have sensibilities that are particularly sensitive. Yeah, Jonathan, he doesn't like those kind of people but there is a character that I love who is a lady Knight. She's very tall. I think she's really attractive. I followed her storyline and it didn't end the way I wanted it to but also that's okay. Sometimes they don't but I want to kind of just keep going with her then if I don't get to see like her have the story that I want. I want to just go with that lady night because I loved every time she was in an episode. I was like, what's that? Okay, just her and she's walking again. She's walking with them princess or a pod walking with him. Yes, I think it would be a great show called princess in the Pod. But the other one that I really loved and I actually don't maybe you know, I don't remember what happened. But the little creatures that created the white walkers the children. I want to just I want the ancient story of that. I want the ancient story of the like three-eyed Raven and the Really fantasy parts of it rather than just the like I don't know War man War people want to hurt people. Yeah, Dragon stuff. I would love the like ancient like ancient stories of the beginnings like the first winter. I don't know like maybe a show called the first winter go for it. Oh, I'm so down. Yeah and like maybe want to have as much money as like Jeff Bezos is pinky toe where I will give some to HBO would be like go ahead. Yeah because like part of that with the children and the Walker's was like that's where they started and so you're like, oh I bet this is going to be important. That's how I met him the other day that said this is like you bet you thought students is going to be important not know the first shot and then you're like no, I mean like their present and they serve to create tension in the storyline. But as far as like what they do, like do they sort of kind of make it past the wall. All right little bit over the entire Series. Yeah. Hello. Yeah, okay and you and if you start to watch it, let me know honestly slide into my DMs be like. Hey Brooklyn, I'm having a hard time with season 1 and I can help hold your hand. Yes. He's in one's got a lot of tittie. Hmm. It's got a lot of sex and I humping sounds ice when I say I spell it s EK s. Yeah, because it's that kind. It's like definitely yeah happening just in a sweaty sort of Quiz 3 walled building. Yeah almost squeaky bed if your delicate sensibilities can Pass that right then you'll that's really all there is and if they don't and you just say hey Brooklyn, I don't want to know any more about that then. Okay, that's you do you and it's 2020 and you know, what's something that you love that I can hate. Hmm, right? Let me know what you love and I can go I don't like it and then now balance this is balance to the force. Yeah. I hate Hershey's Kisses. I was thinking of what I hate that the worst chocolate ever and it's but no note in my opinion. Tootsie Roll, oh my God, most disgusting chocolate thing. It pains me that that actually qualifies chocolate. Yes. I don't think I feel like it's like a Taffy. Anyway. Yeah, I don't want it in my mouth. I don't want to think about it. But I also I would wrap if I had to choose I'd rather have a Hershey's kiss in my mouth now. I'm so sorry. Think about Dove chocolate. That's a good kind of a little like that. Okay. Okay. So next question is this is the second out of the three like cookie questions. What happens when you eat green bell peppers like No, you're allergic but I can't remember exactly. What's the scientific sort of. Yeah, what's going on? Okay, a lot of food related questions, but you know, well, here's the thing listeners if you have an allergy raise your hand right now. I mean, I'm gonna raise my hand. Okay, Jonathan raised it. Feel free to raise it. Don't do it. If you're I don't know why don't lie to fit in right just like it's trendy to have a food allergy like right don't do that. But if you have an allergy, you know, it's hard to describe the feeling. Is that you get when that allergy is occurring unless it's just like oh, I got a rash on my butthole then like there. It is straightforward. Yes, if that happened though. I would be I'd be angrier hmm. Um when I eat a green or any color bell pepper any colors any color my mouth area my throat feels like I have like cold sores all down it. Oh my goodness. Yeah and kind of like I force swallowed a bunch of dry croutons. And they cut me all the way down. That's really bizarre or say I gave you like a soda, but I forgot to tell you that it was exfoliating sort of like if st. Ives came out with a soda. Oh my God, right a bird like an apricot soda, but they've got to say it was a scrub soda some st. You are some styves you are. Okay, last question. Okay. What is your go-to joke that you like to tell I hate it. I hate it so much. But every time I say it people like hell awesome. So how did or why didn't the ghosts wife get pregnant? Why didn't the ghost wife's get pregnant? Why didn't the ghosts wife get pregnant Brooklyn because Had a hollow weiner. It works hang out with so many teens that they're like you talked about a wiener. I'm picturing one now and I'm like who draw it for me ghost? I don't know what they look like. Show me. Yeah ghostly meanors that would be hauntingly beautiful or just like an adult like an adult Casper we all grew up. Let's see what Casper's really got going on. I mean when Casper it turned into the boy, I don't remember what the actor's name was little me like bird. Being sexual Awakening was like he was cute, but we are talking about ending it goes into closer proximity to a child right now. Well, I don't know that's when we all woke up. Yeah, that's when we were like, my crotch is tingles. My crotch is Tangos. Yeah who put out my fire? That's all I was. Okay. So like my go-to joke also involves a weenie. Yay. So there was a pirate walk. Calm down the street with a steering wheel on his crotch a man walked up and said hey doesn't that hurt and he goes our it's driving me nuts favorite joke in my Linguistics class networks who was like, her real name was Susan week, dr. Wink, but we all called her necks, which is short for next alonga. And that's like the word for paradise and Old English. Anyway, she had to have some surgery done on her eye. Time and so she had a patch of her eye and now mind you. I'm in a class that's in a Southern Baptist University and we were all like making pirate jokes. I was like, I'm not a pirate joke and I told that in front of the whole class and boys hadn't dropped, you know, like oh my gosh. No, I you really have to go into character like Disneyland character when you're at a Baptist University, you know, and that's my Disney version of myself, I guess but the person next to me turned to me and she goes Jonathan I cannot believe you said that she was so mad. Well she and Ira yes. Yes. Hold on. I'm getting it I'm getting I learned some things about Brooklyn that I didn't know and so I'm sure you guys did too. I learned some things about me. I didn't know and you because you're really good at asking you're not just like all right number seven. How many times have you had Salisbury steak, you know, which I would say hundreds the only the microwave kind. Oh, well, what else is there? Actually I don't was just thinking that only cafeteria. It's only Frozen. It's only Like Mass heated. Yeah, if you another thing to slide into our ideas about them, let me know if Salisbury steak comes in any other way other than TV dinner. I mean I had to eventually like in the beginning but when God created yeah probably so I loved this we can do this again. But with you if that's okay with you. I love answering personal questions good we can go deeper next time. Yeah. Sorry, I don't never made eye contact with you this much. Honestly, it's like we don't ever look at each other when we talk. Yeah. Well, I mean five years of not being able to truer like this is doing I was like actually, you know, okay guys really quick. Have you ever seen the movie Elizabethtown? Okay, just check yourself really quick. If you have if you have or you have not there's a scene they like these two people kind of bond a little bit and not that much they have like a quick conversation. They don't have much time and then they start to bond over the phone and then they meet Person and then they spend a little bit of time like watching the sunrise and then they say we picked on the phone and I kind of thought we did when we were really good on the phone. We're way better in person now, but there was a time where I was like, oh shit, we peaked on the phone. Like I truly was like we Elizabethtown ourselves. So yeah, it's true. We had a like purely like long text relationship and then looking each other in the eye as well sort of like, okay. Yeah, so, you know for all y'all cat Fisher's out there. That's how you feel to thank you for being here. I want to remind you that I don't know what I'm doing. Although I do enjoy speaking into my phone. I love hanging out in my own closet. I literally yes. I was gonna say I grew up without a phone but I always was in my closet. So that's just where I hang out. I thought before Harry Potter. I was just like I kind of just want to be in a small room and pretend like I'm an orphan. So I appreciate you listening. To me anyways for all the freaking DMS that you send to me and tell me. Hey, I just binged on the way that I'm just listening to you. I'm walking around Target. You're in my ear. I'm like what for everyone who doesn't even know me and you're thinking I'm listening to this girl because wow what a nice jazz radio voice. She has I don't know but you have chosen me and if you're listening to this, you've extra chosen me because this is a longer episode. We're doing a two-in-one. We're doing a Benihana Chris's Parts 1 and 2 kind of thing on you right now and you're saying Yes to it which is so cool. Even if you had to take a week and a half to get here, I appreciate you. I love you and I understand that you have things you got to do. I cannot wait to actually try hard at this in season 2 I do have a fancy microphone. I have all the things. I know I've had it won. I know I got it for that thing that I did that time, you know. Yeah, great. So and then big thank you to Jonathan any last words you want to say to the people you're Big fans now. I just never thought that I would go back into the closet with you. Here we are and now we get to come out together. Yes, honestly, that sounds great. I am a little bit gay. So I guess like I think women are hot and I would love to wow, I like boobs and I would marry one. You just came out of the closet but in the closet, yeah, I'm still in here, but it's so big. It's almost like confusing like am I in am I out? So like subscribe if you can if you know how that works if you don't know how That works Google it or again message me and I'll walk you through the process leave me a review. They make me excited because I'm A 3 on the Enneagram and I need attention and affirmation from others in order to feel like a whole person and if you want to follow me on Instagram, go ahead you probably already do but try it out look me up on there and tell your friends about this if they just want like a cool friend to have I know what it's like to literally just watch like YouTube or listen to podcast and just feel like I'm With my friends like that's kind of mostly what I'm doing. I'm learning sometimes I'm getting all overheated because of True Crime, but mostly what I'm doing is just hanging out with someone that I like. So if you think that there's anybody in your life, that's like dang they probably like those people that I just heard go for it. Yeah sure the crap out of this absolutely and if people want to follow you Jonathan, where should they follow you on the internet? I mean pretty much Instagram was so it's like Jo. 0 n 8e h 0 o 0 I will go ahead and tag. I'll put you in the description of this podcast episode. I'll tag you here and in the podcast episode description or details or whatever. You wanna call it and go look on my Instagram like you'll just you'll be there. You'll be there somehow somewhere somehow. I appreciate you. I have kind of a lot to think about still and I don't know they're more questions on there that I should look at privately. I asked him all oh wow, okay. I did know that I thought you skipped around cool. Well and then in the next coming episodes, I don't know if it's the next one or two after this but I have one coming out of the ten things. I've learned from the office. I wanted to tell you now because if you hate the office, that's okay one another thing we can say that's what keeps the spark alive, you know, we can get through this together. It's a challenge and what is life without challenges. Otherwise, it's just a flat sad Road, right? So if you love the office, we now have Something extra in common. Do you like that? I hope you do. I have some actual friends out there who are I would consider myself an office know-it-all but there are people that I thank you, but there are people who I do know that would consider themselves the same so maybe this is our chance to sort of Duke out. I love you and tell your mom I said hi. Hey guys, it's Brooklyn. And this is an ad that I recorded for you and I I'm doing this. Because I can confirm that the thing that this ad is for is entirely legitimate, and I know that because I'm using it right now. It's called anchor and it's an app that I actually use to record and edit my podcast right from my phone. That's right. Anchor lets me not only recording head of my podcast and do all the little extra details fine-tuned to my liking but also it distributes my podcast for me so that it can be on Spotify Apple podcast app. Stitcher wherever you want it to be it goes there and it just does it for you? You can actually make money that way by doing these types of ads or other ads. It's literally pretty much everything. You need to make a podcast in one place. You can even use it on your computer. If you want to do the whole big setup with the microphone and stuff and it's free. It's free guys, it's free. So like, you know, it's free and it's been so fun to use and So easy and it's so encouraging honestly anchors like good job when I put a new episode out and I'm like, thank you. So if you're into it download the free anchor app, or you can go to Anchor dot f m that's ANC hor dot f m-- to get started.","– The first openly gay man to play a character on a major Hollywood movie is now the first openly gay man to play a character on a major Hollywood movie.

We got you covered here at the homebuilding hero. Today's topic is housing 20 years from now. Hi, I'm your host David Bellman president of bellman homes. Thank you so much for tuning into the Home Building hero today. So again, we're going to talk about housing 20 years from now. What is it going to look? Like? What are we going to see how it's going to be different? But in order to really look forward we got to look back for a minute and it's very simple. So what I did is I look back 20 years ago to some of the things that occurred 20 years ago in the 2000s so that we could kind of then use that as an exercise to look forward. So let's just look back a little bit 20 years ago and see what was happening because sometimes we fail to realize how drastically things can change in 20 years our mind can't Wrap itself around that but once we look back and say wow, look at where we came from look at what has happened and where we are now then and only then can we start to look forward? So 20 years ago gasoline you went to buy gas for your vehicle was a dollar fifteen a gallon. Okay. Now it's fluctuated a lot in that time. It was well over $4 a gallon and somewhere at least in my state now probably about two. 42:30 something like that. So gas was very cheap back 20 years ago. What were people doing? What were the things that were exciting people back 20 years ago? Well, guess what people were playing game boys. Okay. Nobody uses the keyblade anymore. Right? Things are very different. But yeah, the Game Boy was the most popular thing at the time. Music well people are listening to the Spice Girls. That was the actually one of the top hits around that time frame as far as in the world in the United States. What was going on? Well, we had the Clinton affair and of course the impeachment that sounds kind of familiar right now. So we have impeachment going on so not much has changed in that department but 20 years ago. That's kind of what happened. Now I cure some interesting stuff that really starts to make you think a little bit in the 2000s. It was around 1999 right around the turn to 2,000. Google was founded. So Google didn't exist before they could you imagine that everybody probably goes on Google every day. Google has all these different things and all these products and apps and services and things you can buy and use them in your home and the technology that that's created. So that's amazing when you think about that. The iMac people are using I Max that was the hot product the hot computer. Of course for your cell phone people used a Nokia phone. Remember a Nokia phone Nokia has even really around anymore making phones. They got blown away. They got blown away by the iPhone and the Samsung phones and the smart phones, but the Nokia phone did around 2,000 for the first time have internet on it now. It was just basically a black and white screen and you could I believe if you had it set up right you We check an email with that. But that was that was basically the first internet phone. So you start to think about that you go. Wow, 20 years from now, you know our 20 years ago, you know to where we are now you look at what we're doing and it's pretty amazing, right, you know, we have things like Amazon where you can go online and order something have it shipped to your house in two days. We have these Food Services that deliver food to your houses and you know, just like clickable button and you know, obviously we've gotten more into the convenience part of the world, you know, we have all these new restaurants where you basically have casual dining or you can have it delivered to you all those kind of things. Then you start to look at the real estate in the homebuilding market and say that market and that industry hasn't really changed yet. It hasn't really become any different. You know noticeably, you know, we do have some things that have changed like housing can now be you know, search for much easier online before that, you know, people were still kind of using those MLS books and just starting to use the internet now all those sites are ported over and you can search a multitude of places you have things like house and Pinterest and all these kinds of different things where you can gather information you have access to interior designers through things like Twitter. You have podcasts like these with lots of information, but what's going to happen 20 years from now, it's crazy to think about that. I mean, is there a really a right or wrong answer? No, it's it's what are people willing to invest in and what's going to make people's lives better or different or what's really going to disrupt the industry. And again, I could be mentioning all stuff in here and can be all a bunch of nonsense or some of these things could actually come true. We don't know right I mean if you if you said back in 2000 Google's going to be you know bigger than then IBM and one of the biggest companies in the world, you would have laughed, you know said this little thing that you search on. Yeah, give me a break. Well, they had the foresight and they were able to do it. So let's let's look at the future a little bit. What can we see what could change real estate and housing? Obviously, I think one of the things 20 years from now that we're going to look at is especially With the process of buying a home, I think the process of buying a home 20 years from now could be radically different. I think it can be all done on a computer. It would not necessarily have to be done in person. You could have a completely virtual transaction. So whether you're buying existing home now, you may want to still go look at that home. I would always recommend that but you could virtually purchase that home. We're not that far away from it really to begin with but you know, you could do a variety. Jolt or online. I'm really high quality one. You could submit an offer. It could be negotiated and accepted could be a bid process for all we know and you automatically contact a choice of lenders you get pre-approved over the Internet sign your documents closing paperwork's generated. Everything is sent over you sign it. I'm a tablet or phone even and hit a button and send it off. And you have a closing keys are delivered to your home that day of closing and you bought your house. So you virtual closings. I think could be very viable for a new-build. I think a virtual new-build could be very likely as well. So you just got a computer system hit a button pick out options on your home. You see what they look like get the pricing right away and you hit purchase again you go to A lender boom done. And Away you go and the build starts. That's minor disruption that I think there's gonna be more major disruption. You know, we're looking at these challenges right now of skilled labor, and we know that's a problem and you know, we can sit there and try and continue to get people to work in this industry or we could start to embrace technology. We can start to embrace robotics. I think 20 years from now, it's very possible. You could have a home built with about 20% of the labor that we're currently using. I think that's very likely and how that would work is very simple. You know, you use more modulated pieces made in a factory you'd have to have standardization, of course, but you could have let's say a developer go on and buy a piece of land and modularly build these things, you know, these could be 3D printed for all we know 3D printer prints up the wall section. You take a high-powered drone and you drop it on the job site. It sets it right where it's supposed to go. So, yeah, you'd still dig your basement. Put your foundation and your slab and then you have a drone fly over these pre-made Parts drop them in. Maybe you have one person at the site that day just to button everything down and then, you know, you have roof sections that come in drop those in You drop off again by drone maybe a robotic real thing machine that leaves the roof. You know I can again if it's a panelized product. It's probably cited and everything. All you have to do is on the inside run your plumbing and electric so probably have a person go physically to the job site to do that. And then you know, maybe you have pre-made panels again that slap together and then you go in and you drop in your flooring and your cabinets and countertops and finish pumping. So the interior work would maybe have be handled the same way, but you could you could build the shell of this thing, you know with with drones and Robotics heck you could have a robot potentially putting floor down. You could have lots of things like that happen, you know, it could have be a robotic program doubt painter that spray paints those panels on the wall, you know learns a pattern if it's a floor plan you teach you to floor plan. I mean, they already have machines that will mow your lawn. They have vacuums that will vacuum your house for you the learn a pattern why not have something that can spray paint, you know, I don't wall. It's very likely as very possible to do this. Now. The question is, when when do you get to the Tipping Point of it paying for itself as labor continues to increase, you know, you're going to see more and more Reliance on technology more and more Reliance on robotics. One more Reliance on things like drones and computers integrating into their home's so as the homes themselves. They may look different again. We've got a large population of younger people and Building these big homes, if we can get the ability to make smaller homes. I think you'll see more of that. I think you're going to see more high density, you know, maybe Condominiums, you know where you have a seventh floor building built with you know, one and two-bedroom not apartments by condos. And again a lot of that could be built, you know again, if it's done right could be built with with robotics and things so taking the labor out of it. Obviously, I think you're going to see even more technology integrated in. We're just starting to see with the voice technology and stuff like that. But I think you're going to see a lot more you're going to see, you know, kind of voice everything touchless Smart Homes fully functional right off the bat. I think you're going to even see some situations where you know, you're using different products like instead of your traditional Windows. Maybe you have glass that is, you know, got electrostatic charge going through it and you can You know darken and lighten your glass. So, you know again if you're in a high density situation buildings are right in your bio. You don't want to look great at your neighbor you can you know, hey, you know opaque my glass and also in your glasses dark doubt so you can't see your neighbor better yet. You could have an image projected on that screen. So you run an electric charge through it and then broadcast an image on it your window could now be a view of the ocean can be a view of the Jungle or a mountain or whatever it is that you want. I think those things are starting to become available or being thought of and being made and those are things that could disrupt and completely change the industry. Why do you have to buy a lot that's $200,000, you know to get a good view you can have whatever view you want out your window, you know, have a smart window. Who do you know who did that? That could be a thing maybe not but you know people said no to Google and I'm sure they regret it. Now people said no to Amazon Nokia laughed at the idea of a phone being made out of glass and here we have everyone, you know. World now using you know, Samsung phones and iPhones and things like that which are made of glass so don't discount any possibility because something a small idea if it's done right can change the world. I can change an industry it just what is that thing? What are those things and what are the ways that they can be integrated? And then of course at the end of the day do they make Financial sense? Do they pay for themselves? Do they make a difference in the world? world and if they do Then you're going to see that adopted. I think that's a little different about our industry is like the technology industry a lot of times. It's sort of a Gateway. So what I mean by that is like Google was free, right. Google was free search it and what did they do that? They were providing you something for free. They're providing the ability to find something easily. But at the same time they were tracking every single thing that you're looking for and building a profile and building data and looking for Trends and then they use that information. And then they turn that into products that they can sell. So it's kind of an ingenious way where I think our industry the homebuilding industry is more of hey, here's our product by it. And in order for some of this stuff to truly integrate into the industry, you know, we need to see that sort of model potentially of hey, this is use this for free and then you pay for things later that you want to use you pay for the good stuff. I think you'll see some of that the other thing that'll that'll slow. This down in our industry is unlike let's say the Auto industry or electronics Industry the appliance industry where you only have like maybe a handful of key players. Our industry is literally all small businesses. Unless you're in a big Market where your dominated by a few Nationals a lot of remote areas are small businesses. There's 10 20 30 builders in the area that build all the homes. And that doesn't allow as much for that type of product. So you're either going to have to have a bigger brand come in. If you had something like this happen, you would have to have a company that built the infrastructure and either franchise it out or they built out some sort of model that you could buy into and take advantage of all these Systems and Technology or they may get so it's mass-produced where yeah, you can buy the robotic Rover and the robotic painter and the If the Drone system with all the software, you need to import your blueprints into and it takes care of that stuff for you. So it certainly is possible. There are a lot of different ways that things like this could happen. None of this could happen. I'm not saying this will happen. But again, if you look back and you think of how things work and how things are now today a lot of stuff can happen in 20 years from now, so Really just wanted to open people's minds since it's a new year get people thinking about the future thinking about where things could go.

Among the things he looks back on: Gas was cheap, Game Boy was the most popular thing, people were listening to the Spice Girls, Google was founded, and the Internet was the first internet phone. ""But what's going to happen 20 years from now, it's crazy to think about that,"" he says. ""We have these new restaurants where you basically have casual dining or you can have it delivered to you all those kind of things. Then you start to look at the real estate in the homebuilding market and say that market and that industry hasn't really changed yet. It hasn't really become any different."" Of course, there are some things that haven't changed, like the housing market. But there are also some things that have, like the Internet.

I'm Noah Laden with will take today. We've got a really fun show for you guys. We've got Steven Carter and hundred Dupree on to talk about some high school sports and to talk about the new and see a requirement otherwise known as the rich Paul rule speaking of that. Apparently. We have a lot of listeners in the over 50 crowd this past week. We got a call from a local basketball star Bob who's looking to get some recognition for his game and is over 50 league is going to catch up. I also want to tell you like it didn't come through the text message, but in all seriousness, my son and I are huge fans of your son and we'll podcast. In fact, I want to get in an over-50 League have been Scout me just so I can hear somebody on podcast describe me as a stretch three to a player plenty of range got lots of League. He's a 2010 guy good team. Good locker room guy. I want someone to say that about me on a podcast and over 50 leak. So anyway, love love love. The podcast peace out. I mean look, he sounds like a player to me and I know things are tough out there for guys like Rich Paul. So if you're an agent looking for the perfect player for an over-50 League, I think I think you gotta go with Bob. You can go ahead and email us the cgc podcast at gmail.com will hook you up with them. So Bob can finally get the recognition that is game deserves. All right, let's go ahead and start the show. So we're recording on Thursday August 8th. Like we said today we're going to go into some high school sports talk. But before we do that, we have to get our guests some on the not top five this week. We did a sports edition. So well, let's go right into it first one chessboxing toe wrestling and Other sports you need to know about I'm never heard of any of these what it's chat box. I don't want to hear about it. What is test box? I've never heard of is like boxing with chess pieces, or is it playing chess with boxes? I guess it gets quiet chanting boxes. It's got to be cheap playing this is these are toe wrestling needs is just sick to wrestling something like that one bit. He's like thumb wrestling. But with toes, I would I don't like it. I don't like it though. It's like watching. Watching it. That means you'd have to like basically lock your blog or when that waffle the toes you win. That's got sleep. No, I don't want it. I don't want to talk about that. All right football roof, and we'll I knew it would like this one football referee seriously injured after bystander runs on the field and spear tackles him the ground during now on multiple occasions. I have been this person who wants to do this. I'm just glad so many of the balls to do it. Like that episode of Friday Night Lights where the coach tackles Riggins remember? Yes. I do. Remember that. It's like going crazy. That's it. Sounds like but it sounds like I wish I could have seen this I should have read the article. Maybe there was a video attached to it. I mean as I would be gold there's been plenty of times where I've wanted to tackle the referee son cleanses us beard tackle though. That's just that's a whole day like habitats that Walter Mitty moment where like you zone out and like you feel like you're doing it and you can see yourself doing it, but then yeah wake up and you're like I'm into that all right, next one boxing match stopped after Fighters phone fell out of his trunks mid-fight. Now, this is just unprofessional. Yeah, how do you how do you lose your job you pack your lunch box you go to work. You don't you don't put your you don't put your phone in your lunchbox. You don't anyway, so if you're fighting and doing his phone falls out, you know, you automatically win this one right? I mean before fit. Yeah. The main question thing can be stupid you might as well lose. Maybe he was trying to like, I don't know Instagram live it through his pocket. It seemed to not work out with work out for him very well. Argentina soccer player Argentina soccer player red carded after throwing a dog against fence. I'm sorry. I gotta start here. If you grow a dog you deserve like tens of years. I gotta be way more than a red card. Yeah, so let me preface this a little bit because Cuz I just wanted to I didn't once you read the article makes more sense, not really at all. But so that the dog got on the field and so this Argentina soccer player picked it up and try to throw it over the fence. But instead he threw it straight into the fence. Why don't you just set him over the foot know yet? No way. He should like because it looked like he was throwing him sideways trying to turn a bad arm it I don't know but so last 1uf Olympics question. Mark alien spacecraft caught on camera at Olympics. Now. This was in the 2017 Olympics. So I don't know it's been a couple of years there. I just want to see if you all believed in this because I don't I personally don't I think I believe in aliens, but I don't know if they are intelligent life forms that can fly spacecrafts. I I think I think there are aliens that's what it is. I think that's what it is. Yes, I think there's something else out there. I don't know about like big green aliens, but I think there's definitely some sort of other life form like bacteria or something. There's yeah be bacteria on an oxygen ice Planet know if it's a thing there they have two legs. There are four legs are walking. All right, we could talk about sports edition. Anyways, alright. So let's go on and start with what we were going to go through today. The first topic I wanted to go into was all this research. Search says you need to play multiple Sports in high school. So why do you think so many coaches thinks? It hurts you I mean for me personally, I don't understand why coaches would think that it hurts you I think it's I think it's kind of like choosing your major in college because you get to college and you don't really know what you want to do or maybe you do but if you don't know what you didn't want to do like you're taking a bunch of classes trying to figure it out and you can change your major and kind of figure it out as you go and I think that's something that Like multiple Sports in high school can do for you because like like you and me. No, like we loved basketball since we were kids and I was kind of our thing but like for other people, I think that's a good way for them to kind of choose what sport they would want to do long-term or like playing college or something like that. Yeah, and I was wearing some statistics and it's that 71% of D1 football players were multi-sport athletes 30 of the 30 out of the 32 first-round draft picks and the 2017 NFL draft or multi-sport athletes in high. So I think it can also like there's so many research like so much research behind like less emotional burnout not putting all your eggs in one basket injured less, too often more coachable smoother transition other precision's and overall higher ceilings. So I mean I think in ways it really could give student like high school athletes advantages High School coaches pretty much put you at a disadvantage if you're not there for all of their work. Workouts are all of their practices like we saw that with the football players like we had an advantage over them in a way because they had their season that ended right when our season started. Yeah, so they missed all of our workouts and our beginning practices. So that would put them at a disadvantage or coach would coach would even say like they were at a disadvantage there. Yeah. I mean from a football player. What do you think as far as multi-sport? I think I had a kind of unique experience in high school because Was a multi-sport athlete I played football and baseball and so when baseball season was around it. That's when football was start their morning workouts and I wouldn't be able to make it but fortunately I think I was good enough athlete not to toot my own horn or anything, but I think I was I was fortunately good enough to where I could come back to football and even though I missed all those workouts, I was still able to like start all silly. What a start. And be right there so I don't know why. Yeah, I'm not sure why coaches wouldn't like it. Do you think it hurt you in the recruiting process playing two sports? Oh, absolutely. So that's what I that's what that was my point. Why do you think that because during the summer I'd be playing a lot of a lot more baseball and football and all of my football teammates would be going to all these, you know college camps and stuff and I would really want to go but I've got you know, a baseball tournament that weekend and so I can't go and I have to you know, I made a commitment to that baseball team have to stay there. And so I didn't get a whole lot of exposure or at least I didn't get as much as I would have liked. So yeah, definitely hurt me in the recruiting process. Yeah, and I would guess that just from a coaching standpoint, even if they you know, probably know that it could be a really good experience to play multiple Sports. They would just want like their player just playing their sport kind of selfish. Yeah, so selfishly, like if you're a good athlete they're not going to say yeah go out and play baseball and miss this or God and play basketball and I would just think that it's so they can have you year-round pretty much but I mean if you look at the The list of professional athletes who played multiple Sports in high school like LeBron played football Michael Phelps Derek Jeter Tim, Duncan MJ Matt Holliday, Donovan McNabb Tony Romo, Michael Vick this one mouthful. I was trying to work. Well anyways yikes. Yeah, and actually a lot of NFL quarterbacks, like even some of the like really successful ones got drafted and of the MLB to like Jameis Winston Russell Wilson, Tom Brady actually did not a lot of people know about that. So obviously football worked out for them, but I think if you're that good it can give you kind of a back-up plan and I mean colleague Marie became the first player to be drafted in the top 10 of 2 separate drafts. So I think it can really only help I mean if you're in the like you brought the example of putting all your eggs in one basket that can help with that because if baseball doesn't work out and that scenario if that's what you choose you can go to football or vice versa. And I mean it can really only be in my opinion like it can only help because it gives you that Back-up Plan one thing. I want to say to just like from my experience in high school. Like when I was a sophomore and Junior we had like insane athletes playing football that could have been like a really huge assets or basketball team and they knew like coming in from their football season. They were going to have to be like pushed to the point where we were which was three four months and two conditioning. And I mean if you think about our season we didn't I don't think we did anything that season really know and think about what would have happened if we had those athletes or our freshman year and we had a court and the court in Rashon golden, like maybe they're not good at basketball that doesn't even matter like conviction little gonna is in the NFL. Yeah, it was good. But like we're thinking about Rashawn golden like out there getting bored just playing defense like he's so athletic like he could be a a fast quick. ADI out there. Yeah, but these players don't want to do that because the time commitment that our coach than any other coach would want out of their players. Yeah, I think for for some of the players the football players. I remember it was a lot of the conditioning part of it. Like you said like they would have to be pushed to the conditioning that we were already at. We were doing a hundred and twenty Sprint's every every day for conditioning and I mean that was like four months. Yeah, and that was rough for us and like we'd been doing it. So like honestly, it's hard to expect someone to Jump right back in and be conditioned like that. It's it's gonna be hard and it's going to be a lot of work and like especially if you're getting recruited and like your you have multiple offers from colleges for football. I feel like that's just hard to get that desire to want to run for basketball. If you're gonna go D1 and football, do I ran a mile and a half yesterday and I puked I couldn't do under and twice Prince I ran in for my car the other night because it was raining. No, there was a A shooting in Spring hell yeah ever. Yeah. Oh it was that close to streets over. Yeah. I was here. Shoot. Yeah. That's this is the worst thing in Spring Hill that's happened since like the Burger King shooting write your answer that yeah. I do like two years ago or some shooting yikes. That was a I was one of the more scary ones because it was like right there. Yeah, that's one. We liked what we freshmen sophomores. I remember rightly earned freshman freshman. Let's move on. So I just want to move this topic just a little bit and like see what y'all think about why coaches are also into going year round for me. I think like a lot of coaches definitely want to build camaraderie and like Community within their team because those camps that we did like we went to MTSU and we'd go to Belmont and WKU to do basketball camps in high school and like just staying in the hotels and staying in the dorms with the guys like that was just it was really fun and it makes it more More fun on the court to when you're having those experiences outside of the court to yeah, that makes sense. I wanted to so dupes. You played baseball. Yeah. I know like growing up and I've heard from like anyone who plays baseball that like travel baseball. You have to drop like so much money. Yeah time like I was reading an article a sign that said like the lower end for a lot of baseball players like 7,500 a years. Yeah, just to play like travel baseball and like you're gone. Every weekend Matthew Hargrove. Yeah played baseball, and we never saw me. Yeah, so for me, I only played one year of quote travel baseball on that was for the I think we were called the Spring Hill Nitro, and we went the furthest. We went was like Jackson Tennessee. We weren't like we would like one and nine or something in our tournaments, but we went to Jackson, Tennessee. And that's where I got one of my nicknames. There's a little anecdote for another time maybe but anyway, long story short. I got my head stuck in the railing at a hotel. Yeah. Anyway, what's your nickname Stuckey? Nice? Yeah. Wow, is it that's where it came from? Yeah. That's where I'm from. Yeah, it's pretty how'd you get out? I had to have it and I had to have two dads Two Dads. All the bars apart. Okay, here we go. So we were saying on the second floor of the hotel and outside, you know, there's a balcony and there's a railing and so I was sitting outside on the railing and I put my legs through my likes to fit through fine, and I was just sitting there and then a couple of my teammates were down below outside throwing baseball and they called to me and I couldn't see them because they were directly underneath me. So I was very smart and I stuck my head. Through the railing very Innovative and I looked down and then I went to go back at my ears were like a growing so big that they couldn't fit back through so I had to get two dads. Anyway, um, so yeah travel baseball is expensive and it is like you said, it's year round and it it really kind of burned me out that one year that I play travel baseball and I never did it again. I just played like Recreation baseball. That I mean and I think that's what it does with a lot of kids. Absolutely and you you even look into other sports and it's like just on the basketball side you have your season which is over in March. Then you immediately start a you but you get your two week break from school. Yeah, you start spring practice while you're doing a you and then you go into summer practice a still going off on and then you get your two weeks off and the summer. With all dead period is awesome. But in that two weeks you're expected to go to the gym and shoot and left and all that stuff and then school team summer tournaments right after that and then summer workouts and then fall practice and workouts and then you start back in October and you go to a March and so you get you have to go 48 of the 52 weeks and really like you don't get those four weeks off because one of them you're doing a you the other one. He's like expecting to go to the gym. Yeah. I think that's really a that's where it's tough because I mean they're all kids. But um, that's where they're going to have to make personal decisions. Like what their commitment level is going to be because they have to understand that if they're doing spring workouts for high school and then they're playing like travel or a you or something. Both of those coaches are going to expect them to be fully committed and present at both of their different workouts and games and stuff. So that's just I think that's just a decision. That kids are You have to make and it's really hard because a you is more fun. But like you want to be at the spring workouts kind of show out a little bit and gain muscle mass and stuff so that you can impress your high school coach. That's just it's hard. Do you think that's what like that kind of schedule is what's ruined sports for a lot of people going in high school. Yeah. Definitely I think like for you and me I was I was kind of fine with it just because I genuinely have such a love for basketball. I could do it all day. But yeah, I think if you kind of make it a job and more of something you have to do rather than something you get to do when you're doing it for a lot of hours every day. It's just it's tough to kind of have the desire to keep going with it. Yeah, so we'll also played lacrosse in high school. So I wanted to see because that's not usually one of the main sports you talk about going year round. But I mean, I'm sure it's the same as the rest. Yeah, so there was really only one year that at I played completely year-round and it kind of I still like enjoyed it the whole time but it kind of took my motivation level down. So like my freshman year. I played it Ravenwood and then I knew I was going to transfer to father on my sophomore year. So once my season ended it Ravenwood, I joined this summer travel team that was like a branch off of Father Ryan played all summer. And then when I got there we had so like we did that summer league started. Fall ball which wasn't a lot it was like workouts after school and then one on Friday mornings and then like a scrimmage on Sundays and then during that I played on another like little fall travel team and while I was doing that I was playing indoor lacrosse. So that was during kind of fall early winter pretty much had December off, but then you start spring season right when you get back to school in January and it was fun and it was good memories, but that kind of going into my junior year. My motivation was kind of down and kind of burnt you out. Yeah a little bit because I still really enjoyed it that whole year, but I was kind of like always tired and always doing something for the cross like we actually had a spring break trip that cut my spring break short which menu which made me really mad and then I should quit and then I actually ended up quitting my senior year. I love how you said we started our spring season in January. Yeah, January is the second month of winter because you have you would go back and have what they call hell week, which is like the week of like that's our tell ya the weak of heart is conditioning and then have conditioning for like you don't really put on the pads until a month or so into practice and I was just working out pretty much. Okay, so we got to move on because we're we like 10 more things to talk about before. I just want to have one quick conversation about a you if you don't I want to listen to it skip ahead like two minutes. Give me real quick. I think a use great for getting kids exposure and playing some Elite competition. Other than that, I really feel like it's a hit or miss just to be honest from my perspective because growing up when I started playing I started playing a you when I was pretty young and I was on a great like in a great organization where it was a lot of they worked on your skills. We had a lot of practices like we would have like three or four week, which is not so For any team, which I think helped me a lot growing as a player growing up and then I played in high school and you're playing with a bunch of guys. Like when I when I moved here and I played in high school. I was playing with on the floor with four other guys who wanted to get their 20 or whatever and then we would have one practice a week and we would play the whole practice like we pick up the whole practice. And I mean that I understand you got school ball and then you got this but I feel like I mean, I personally enjoyed a you a lot. I mean I did. I loved it you but yeah, but I totally get you're saying there's just a lot of guys. I only played a you I think like going into my freshman year of high school. So like it wasn't really this. Oh, yeah, like we're gonna go get recruited and stuff like that. Like I just need to get my like you said get my 20 I think definitely like when I played it was more of like the team aspect and I think I think a pro to AAU basketball is just like getting to know other coaches that you don't play for like at your high school. Cool and your respective school because that's definitely helped me along the way especially like having some opportunities to coach this summer like at a different High School. I wouldn't have known that coach without playing Foreman a you so I mean cool one of the things I wanted to hit was I think a you teams more often than not when I played when I was younger, we would play man-to-man. I feel like a lot in high school it was down and let me tell you in high school basketball. We did not play zone. Very often in college basketball other than Sarah Creek Syracuse. You don't see Zone very often. Yeah, and in the NBA, you don't see Zone very often and I get it's like, oh we don't want to come out here and play defense. Like I think that kind of just speaks to what the point of a you is like. It's a very offensive game. I don't think a lot of kids are trying to play a you to impress coaches with their defensive skills at all. It's like here. Let me go Duncan. Hopefully this coach will Amir let me Splash a few threes and maybe this coach will see me and that's the thing. I feel like a you doesn't got it devalues wanting for players to because you go out there and your play four games a day. You could lose three out of four and it's like I'm not beating myself up over those those. Yeah, like listen, I got 25 that coach saw me like I don't even care, you know, like I'm still going to get my offer. I got my Columbia State offer from my adult league. I dropped like 35 in an adult league playing against some 40 year olds in the guy who was doing the scoreboard was one of their coaches at Columbia State music. Hey, I want you to come work out with us this week and you're like, hey, no, I'm not I was like I've work at Chick-fil-A, so that'll be a no not a chance. What are the Chargers complete for the Chargers? You might be able to walk on stormy? Maybe I don't know. Can you walk on and I hope they God not. Thank you. Can you wanna hear about my best football I do. Okay. So seventh grade was when I tried football Al you know, because that's perfect time to try. Yeah, absolutely trusted. My dad was like a he was a big football player and middle school and high school and he was like Middle School. You don't want to be a wide receiver because they don't throw the football. That's true and I was like screw you death. I'm gonna be a wider seat. All you do is blow. All I did was blocked. Yeah, but one play we threw it. Okay, we have I think it was like first first quarter. I was like, we're running a pass play and I wasn't I was like a third wide receiver that yeah our quarterback with throat to I was definitely not the first but nobody else was open. He hits me I catch it. Okay, and I'm like, I'm in the clear I see the end zone and I'm running. Oh, I got lit up like son of so hard that like, I don't I don't want to remember. Like it was that it was that thing where all the Middle School parents are. Like if you hear a gasket, no, it's okay. Did you do you hold on to the ball? I know you've all I had to do just like nobody prepared me to do one dude. It's a shock like yeah, what do I do? Oh you'd be running gassers. If you are my future my guess. I caught it for I don't even think in practice. They threw to me. They're like, I you just gonna block like you're blocking me. So when I caught it I was like, Like oh, I don't know what to do with this. Um, it was good prep for basketball. Yes. Go ahead since you just coach like freshman football and like the young kids and like you said like those kids can't I mean a lot of people don't even really haven't fully grown at that age. Yeah, like I know I didn't really start actually getting taller until I was a sophomore and but I would ask what is something that you would change about like the whole course of high school football like how you played all throughout? Is there anything you would change from like Varsity I think so for for playing varsity because and I'm tooting my own horn again, and I'm sorry. I just have trying to you know, tell my experiences. I didn't play JV game. I went straight from freshman football to Varsity you egomaniac. Yeah, right and it was like that with me and I think for other guys on the team and it was a very hard. Third transition from freshman football which is right after Middle School football. They're both very similar and very slow. So then playing against D1. Yeah guys hurts. Yeah huge getting recruited by the big-time schools like Juwan Jennings. Yeah. I played against him my sophomore year. Jeez. You're still like a little boy at that point. Yeah, and I was a I was young dude. I remember watching him play in high school. He was like kind of be tackled know he played Safety to Denis. Yeah. He And we pan we were so close to being Blackman. They all remember that that was the comeback. Yes at home is raining really bad. Was that it? No, that wasn't. No it wasn't but yeah, I think as a sophomore I'm not saying that no sophomore should play Varsity, but I think that you should have like 3 JV games under your belt before you're able to start Varsity. I think that's one thing I would change so you would say maybe he's those guys who are good enough to play Varsity, but maybe not ready. For the big change kind of help them get slowly acclimated to that. Yeah, absolutely and I might get like backlash from that saying oh, whoa, you know if they're good enough to play varsity they should play but maybe physically they are but mentally they're not I definitely was not I don't think there's any harm in like not rushing the player up. Anyways, yeah because this is going to be better for the player and for your team. Yeah and having them develop for a little bit longer before he's out there. I mean, I think it works out with you. Because you got that experience by the time of those are senior year. It was like nothing. Yeah, it was Clockwork senior year, but like it was I think it I think that could also go the complete opposite direction. Yeah, so I wanted to do a couple quick questions that are kind of like high school sports related that I thought would be interesting the first one be dumbest thing a coach has ever had you do I'll go ahead and start so starting like maybe a month before summer was over we would start. Art doing sprints and we would lift not touching a basketball at that point. I mean, all right, whatever then school starts and from I would say August to the end of October. We would do a hundred twenty Sprint's every day and we'd left before and then we would go home. So we didn't touch a basketball from Midsummer till like two weeks before our first game and then people are like why can't you shoot? Yeah. What do you think but and I really didn't honestly like I didn't feel that in shape from those like they were a lot of Sprints and they were really tiring but I think they could have done something better with like a ball in her hand. Like yeah, it could have been just as hard with a ball in her hand. We were kind of condition but it didn't feel like game ready condition. So before we would actually do these workouts me and two of her three other guys from the team after school. We would go to McDonald's eat as much as we could. Good to see if we can make it through the 120s without throwing up. So that was a bad idea. But that's probably why I wasn't in shape. I was eating McDonald's before it. Anyways, Stephen. What's yours? Um this I don't think this is necessarily something that like I had to do for this sport. But like this is just so stupid in high school. Our coach made us wear ankle braces and like he was so adamant like guys, like if you don't have your ankle braces on don't even come to practice it was and And I had never had ankle issues before and so like I wore the ankle braces all season and then like I ended up partially tearing my ACL in my right knee and my meniscus in my right knee and then like a month after that. I ended up partially tearing my meniscus in my left knee. It's because like when you wear the when you wear those ankle braces your ankles like start to rely on that so they like yeah, they're weaker. Yeah that my physical therapist was like, yeah, like if you didn't have ankle issues you did not be Why you should not be wearing ankle braces if you don't have ankle issues because now your ankles need the ankle braces and that kind of like weakens everything up your leg and I ended up having like some hip problems too. So like that was just so stupid. I should never have had to wear ankle braces because it ruined my knees and they still hurt to this day. He's all right. Dumbest thing I've had to do was probably for baseball in high school. Mike I will not say nothing but someone might so, I don't know you might know who it is. We often times it would rain as you know, as it does it rains and we can't have batting practice outside. So we'd have to do batting practice in the auxiliary gym, huh, and that might not be dumb because we need batting practice, but I think it would be totally worth it to spend a couple Grand. Build like a tin roof over the batting cages outside and maybe some Turf and any time it rains we can go in there because hitting balls like on the gym floor as a former eighth grade basketball star that can you know hurt the floor and tear out. Yeah. That is those pretty stupid. Yeah. Yeah, that's dumb. We're going to tell the story. Oh yo, yo, we want that to get out to the public. Honestly, I think here's I want to I want South Williamson and know that we're still pissed. All right. Now I will forever be upset about that. I am Dickie I said the in this podcast we tell it. All right. I'm down. I'm cool. I'm trying to think. I don't have many like crazy things that a coach made us do there was one time the only one that really comes to mind. We had like a morning workout. That was always conditioning but our strength coach made us like get with a partner. And we did like a race down and back the field of like you would get a giant medicine ball and one person would throw it as far as they could then the other person would run to it and throw it as far as they could until you got down and back and it just felt like because by the time you're like down the field once you've been throwing as far as you can and you're like pretty tired, yeah, and that was that was one of the things that I was like, how does this really help us play lacrosse? I guess maybe the throwing of the medicine ball strengthens, you know, like you're throwing on with the stick, right I guess but we were all just kind of like it was so and we never did that again or before that. So it was just kind of like a one-time thing that we're like, why do we do that? So what I really want to hear is Hunters best high school play because I'm pretty sure that me and him have the same favorite moment from high school. A bar. Alright, so we ran a spread in high school and our offense was our offense always got the headlines and so our defense didn't really score a lot. But we were playing in the first round of the playoffs in my junior year and we're playing against Cane Ridge and what me and John Bane had a bet about this you absolutely did. Okay, so can I press this that before you tell the Or yeah, go ahead. And so John Bane and I shall to him had a bet that year that if dupes got a pick six at any point. He would have to streak the field now tell your story and I'll tell what happened after. Okay, so junior year. We you know, we're playing Cane Ridge and we were kind of stopping them and right before halftime. I'm on the field. I'm playing middle linebacker. And I read my guards the guards give a high hat. So I dropped back for a pass and I see the back out of the backfield like come straight for me. And I'm like, is he running a router? Is he trying to block for a draw but he was definitely running a pass or a running route and quarterback threw the ball. I caught it. I ran like hell and I school that was my only touchdown and High school, so when this happened as he was running you saw the fear on John's face because he was like, oh, no our friend group was going are fresh. They are whole friend group was in the same row. Just freaking out like yes, we were hyper or boy but yes, we're about to see our boy completely naked on getting a key and the student section leader like the senior that year was like one of our friends was named Cameron Vinson and he turned around because he knew the better. I mean he told the whole John had to streak and it was the - I think John like fell on the ground and we were trying to like pick him up. I think that's how long lost his legs like all the blood rush to is that it was like I'm dumb ass down. We didn't make him. I don't know. I guess you would have gotten like a rest of felony for sure. Yeah ever, you know, but yeah, so that was that was my favorite play high school dips. Like my phone was off before we go to break. I want to go ahead and tell this little mic story. I'll start it off and then you we can figure out the best time but basically so my Junior you mean Stephen and dupes junior year. We all played on the same wreck basketball team. We called herself. The shark's Fins Up Fins Up and it was pretty much our whole friend group and we had a lot of chemistry. And yeah, and we all played really well together. Like we just had a really solid team. Yeah, and so nobody ever like compete like it wasn't really a competition because right basketball obviously not very not a high competition. So we're in the semi-finals of like that wrecked tournament or whatever and half of our team is on a church trip. Yeah. It's like jack-ay Bears Gone John Baines gone, Jacob Bells gone Deep Deuce was our Center that naive starsin. Yeah, Jackie birds like six to I'm 510. So I sent so this this not it was me Steven Matthew dupes and been heart. Yeah that we had we had illegally put Charlie worth on our DNA. Who else Jackson Jackson twaddle? They didn't play a minute. Sorry guys, but like but they they were on our team because we only had five and we just needed to make sure so we're going on this we're going through this game. We've actually played this team before Clapton by 40 the we beat a really bad. I remember in that game. The one of their players walked up to me and bump me a little bit and I fell over and the ref turned around and gave them a technical. So there they were already already already. I was I was so At you for that I hated that but like that that first game that's when he looked at dupes. We're on the free throw line. You said he said I'm gonna There's some yeah. I said, please don't I said, I'm gonna bleep that whole part out. Okay, because you know, but I'm gonna bleep his name out to yeah. Okay, that's fine from from now on will refer to him as Jeff Jeffrey Jeff Carter Jeff Carter coach Coach Jeff Carter, if you're listening this shout out man. Shouts. What are you up to JC? Anyways, so we clapped on the first game. I don't think they already like don't like us because of my immature. Move but second game were short-handed. I think like we're all like having a great game this game and I think it's pretty close though because it was close the majority of the game until the very end because they're player Jeff quote-unquote is like nail and shots from like the volleyball line. And so it's like the third quarter of the game. I remember they're really good player. Jeff comes down and pulls the three and I'm For some reason I was on him. I don't know if we were playing Zone but he came down on me like grabbed my neck and like pulled me to the ground. Yeah, and then I'm looking up at the ref because I don't know if they're calling anything else about to like be pissed and all I know from there was the ball rolled over to Stephens dad and you can tell the rest story. Okay, wasn't so it rolls over to my dad. So naturally like my dad picks it up and this guy Jeff as my dad is going to hand the ball to the r if he comes over. My dad and smacks it out of his hand and then Jeff's dad looks at my dad and goes. Hey, don't you ever touch my son like that again? And I just want to say something Stephens. Dad is the nicest person on the planet. Absolutely every yeah. So Jeff's dad was like don't ever touch my son like that ever again. And then Jeff like it's about to swing at my dad Hunter dupes. He comes out of nowhere and grabs this kid. Yeah, and then unlike at that point like the rest is history. Everything cleared benches bleachers everything thing. I looked I was a man on the ground this point because I'm just like it was like happened so fast and I look over and all I saw was dupes flying boom Tate like saves the day but then like the whole gym collapses and people are throwing people are not swinging. I was pushed up against the wall and I saw another friend of ours cold humor was on that team. I don't know if you guys remember Kohinoor came up and Tried to like get me out of there and Jeff throws a punch and hits coal in the face. And so I and cold like I love you guys, but Cole is my best friend. Yeah, and so I'm like he did not Jeff Jeff's like is basically what was in my mind. I saw I saw that Dynamic like happened because like I saw you grab coal and like you I saw you protecting Co like that mode that you were in there was insane. I loved you for that. Yeah. Yeah, I have already to means it died down really quick because then the cops are running. Yeah, we yeah, we got a player has scored again squirt out because like no. Yeah a real kid said he was gonna and dupes lightweight today in the game there. Yeah, and then we got suspended. But yeah, it's likely after this like we're all just trying to get back to our families. I'm trying to get home. So we all get we we all get home after that and we get an email the next morning from the the person who runs the league who sucks. Like we did not like them they accused us of a lot of stuff things, but they basically were like hey y'all are y'all are done and we're like we did nothing and that was our last year to play rack like we were too old the next year. We were too old our senior year Yang and then you know, they cut that League out my God, there's no longer you 17. Yeah, they cut the legal because of the fight because of us. Yeah it kind of what kind of dogs it's sick. Anyways, um, let's take a break.

So it can be heard everywhere like Spotify Apple podcast Google podcasts and many more you can easily make money from your podcast with no minimum listenership. We use anchor for this podcast, and we absolutely love it. Okay. So let's go ahead and get back to the show. So this week I think there's this week or maybe last week and the past two weeks. Um, the NCAA made they basically made a new requirement that agents have to have a bachelor's degree. So and they have to have these like these other certifications and it's got a lot of backlash especially from like LeBron Chris Paul Darius Garland tweeted about it even like Kevin Hart tweeted about it. Tristan Thompson miles Bridges because rich people Is a big NB a-- agent if you don't know and he didn't go to college she doesn't have a degree or anything. And so the NCAA made this role and basically everyone super upset about it. I see both sides of the argument one way is the NCAA. They're trying to keep the sketchiness away from these athletes because they don't want them to get scammed or these cuz have random like guys come up to you and be like, hey, let me be your agent. And it could set them off for the worse. Some people also think it's in response to Rich Paul one theory is that it would prevent him from getting future agents because Paul represents Darius Paisley and he negotiated a contract with him to make a million dollars as an intern for New Balance which allowed him to train for the NBA while skipping College altogether. He was the number 23 piglet draft, but there's a theory that the NCAA is making this rule. For him and agents like him. I just want to see where y'all stood on this whole debate. I don't know. I mean me I feel like me more than anyone else like I'm a huge advocate for the college education and like I've absolutely loved my college experience and I wouldn't go back and do anything differently. But um, I don't know like Rich Paul. He's obviously been very successful like representing LeBron and like bunch of other people and like he I mean he didn't go to college so It's just kind of hard to say because there are people who have been really successful like even LeBron like he's a successful and be a player. He never went to college. So like I think it's just it's a tough limitation to look at because I feel like that that's what it is. Like it's a limitation to a lot of people who either don't want to go to college or maybe like don't have the money to go to college because if you're not like a D1 Prospect or something if you just like want to make friends like be an agent or something and you don't have the money or the means to go to college then like How else like how else can you do it? Right? I think the I don't know if the bachelor's degree is cool. I liked certifications and I think maybe the NCAA should come out with a statement or or say something makes some sort of public class or a background or like background like a background check and an application just like regular job and then you would get into these couple of classes that would teach you a lot about the industry stuff like that. At yeah, and that way you made a weed out for your maybe that could come, you know, maybe give scholarship opportunities for stuff like that. I don't know there needs to be you know, it's just creating more jobs. Yeah, I think I think that's the filter that it needs in like the filter that would really work because that kind of weeds out people who like our kind of doing it to scam young like naive players because if they're like, yeah, I'm willing to get this certification. I'm willing to go to these classes then like they're like, they're really in this and this is what they want to do so that kind of leads People are like no. I just want to make some money off these kids, right? Yeah. I could I kind of see it as I think it could definitely help keep some of that out of just guys who are trying to make quick money. But also, I mean, you still everyone wants to make money. So I would think that it wasn't completely stop some of these guys from even if they're very certified have a college education. I mean, I think there would still be some of those people out there who would want to kind of use the players to their own Advantage so I don't know and I don't know why they really did it now because if you're just talking about rich Paul, like he has shown that you don't really need that to be a successful agent. Right the way I look at it is I always see the NCAA trying to I think they're trying to further restrict these players and control these players because a lot of the things they do it seems that it goes that way if you can get in the position that rich Paul did without a bachelor's degree and you can work up to that position. I mean, I think you deserve it. Like I like the idea of more certifications more bat like a background check applications, but at the end of the day if you can get a job like that without a degree there shouldn't be more holding you back from that. It's already hard enough. Like there's not a bunch of Rich Pahl's out there, right? There's Rich Paul and especially like if they're if they're only using Rich Paul as a reference for adding the bachelor's degree in the extra certification. He's like, he's one scenario. Yeah in which like in which they're looking at. So like He's a bad scenario for their case. Yeah, it's like I just don't understand where they're coming from. Like why are they looking at this as such a negative thing? I and I also like understand they're trying to help these players by not letting him get scammed. But also they're adults at this point. There's a chance that we like same chances of us getting scammed. They can be careful. They are there like men at this point. They can take care of themselves if they get scammed. That's on their fists - yeah should be on the yeah, you mean you don't support any Nigerian Prince's? Yeah, and I'm just wondering if like at the beginning of the summer one of the top recruits for the 20. I think was it 2020 class? Yeah said that he skipping college to go play in New Zealand overseas so that he can actually make money while still training where he want to be able to in college and maybe like this guy Darius Paisley if he's good enough to be a top 25 pick, but he ended up Skipping college and just training for the draft if they simply just trying to restrict that to where there's more agents that are focused on getting them through college and doing everything kind of by the book. I'm just wondering if that was kind of their motivation behind this because they haven't really said why they're doing this they just kind of change that rule and everyone's confused about it. Would that affect players like RJ Hampton like what he's doing, but that's what I'm saying is like maybe that kind of sparked it but would that Even change because I don't think that's not scamming them out of a college education or anything. The I mean it is telling them not to go to college but it's still helping the player. They're making money for themselves off of their basketball skills while still getting better for the next level and I mean to be honest most of these players it's not going to change they'll still do it under the table. Like that's how a lot of these agents operate. Anyways. Yeah, and this is our Johansen even tweeted. He was in CA sucks. That's why I'm not The swam in what New Zealand getting paid and guys are always going to want the opportunity if they can to make money rather than not make money. All right. So we like to have all of our guests tell one of the one of their best craziest worst college stories. Either of you want to go first. I go ahead one night was my roommates birthday. And so we were having a little party for him a little get-together one of our friends who's a girl goes into his room like to take a nap. Because she's tired or something or whatever and our twin beds in our dorm room likes it kind of high up and she was so out of it. She fell hit her head on the corner of his nightstand like the corner. It's like wood and it's like sharp and so no one knows this for like 15 minutes and then my other roommate goes in there sees her and comes back in he says, hey just you know, so, you know So and so whatever her name is is also dead by the way. We're like wait what so we go in there? And she's like on the floor crying her eyes out because it hurts so bad. And so we're like, this is a really bad situation because she did hit her head. We knew that long story short me and my friend whose birthday it was had to stay up all night to make sure she didn't fall asleep because she might have had a concussion and she could have slipped into a coma. Oh my God. Yeah. Oh, is she? Okay. Yeah, she's fine. It's like them out but just like that feeling like yeah. Well, thanks for that terrifying story. Um Stephen cheese. Do you have anything insane like that? No, not even close but one time this was actually this I mean this is pretty scary from my perspective. So we were me and a few friends like we had like seven people in a car and like my friends. He's literally like terrible driver and so like we had seven people in the car and I was sitting in the front. See with one of my buddies and I was like how many seats are in like they're five. Okay, so it's like you're stacking it up. Yeah. So like I was basically like squished up against the door and this guy like we were turning left out onto Main Street and it was like traffic was crazy and like like there's always like a lot of cars going out on that road and my friend who I was sitting with he was like right here with me and the front seat decides as we're turning left. Left to open the door and like so I like em on the door. So I like basically fall out of the car and he's like holding me as we're turning left and like my face is about to just like scrape against the pavement as we're driving and like I thought I was about to have like my last breath. I thought I was gonna die. He pulls me back in we close the door and he's like Wasn't that great and I was like no, I thought like I almost died. Like I literally almost done. He's like you like know that was fun. You're an all Psychopaths shout out Anderson Venice. Do you remember in high school like sophomore year when we were at a birthday party and we were driving through a field for some reason and you were there for some reason on the hood of the car. I got on the hood of the car. We're driving like in a bumpy field and our friend Jack striving like a A maniac like he was doing donuts with him on the nobody asked him to do this and Stevens like hanging Lon and I'm out the sunroof. Hang on a Stephen because no but Jack I'm like Jack so down. He's like no so like I'm holding on the Stephen but you could have gone like under that. Yeah and like got trampled by the way. That's how a lot of people in our County like, that's cool. We gotten seriously injured. You're like killed so like yeah, it's terrifying. Yeah. I never did that again. No, but it's good. Anyways, um, this was awesome we need to do this again. Yeah, sure. So next week. I'm moving into school this weekend Wells moving in next weekend. So we're actually going to record our podcast hopefully Saturday night after he moves in we're going to be tired, but we're going to do it might have Chuck on. Yeah. I'll see what he's up to.

And we're going to make you sit through our recap of it. Yeah, you remember the hellish experience of watching National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation with us. We're going to do that only for like a few minutes and I think that but more obscure. Yes. Yeah something you have no point of reference for and Chad is an amateur. Olli artist now and just sort of rattling things around and he's a prop comic now, it's not do that turbo is it's a TC. He's like ripping pieces of celery in half. He's going to pick which slide whistle to use for this. Yeah pop into coconuts in the ground. All right, so if you are following along if you You want to continue this ridiculous Journey should go to YouTube go to the Ray Parker jr. Ghostbusters video and hit play now. No fun fact. Huey Lewis sued, Ray Parker jr. For copyright infringement because this sounds too similar to I want a new drug. Also a great song. I Love Huey Lewis. Huey Lewis also has Meniere's disease and which I have so, you know, it does sound a lot like Huey Lewis. But pretty erotic there's our iPhone on the wall. It's very looks like Tron. Yeah. What the fuck is this is Ray Parker jr. Himself a ghost in this music video. Why is it so fake high-tech children seems like he would not be advocating for the busting of ghosts. Oh my God, I can't believe I didn't even think to mention that he would be shout-out to Duncan from trivia dot cool for getting me a Ghostbusters Christmas or birthday. Isn't this year in from the movie? Appreciate it? Yeah, I'm always sure there's it's a lot of clips from the from Ghostbusters. Why are those kids in that haunted house? He's a ghost. Why aren't the stars of ghosts? Why are the stars of the movie in the video while they are in in clips from the movie now, we're gonna turn her later. It's like a weird neon fake. So Ray Parker is the fishing pole the pull that okay sheet off that. Parker uses horny ghost energy to pull that ladies blanket down there in school with it, huh? I don't know who that lady is, but I've seen her in movies. How do you know? Ghostbusters, great movie this video is this is bad strange. Very strange guys are crazy. This is great. No. No, I mean it's really good. We have a girl running around in in underwear. Basically that hallway reminds me of the hotel. We stayed at in Berlin. John Candy's on Candy R.I.P. I love you. Okay. Yeah, she's just trying to get away from this creepy. Yeah, like he's trying not to get raped his hair like the girls. Yeah, why is very threatening? He's saying he's not afraid of ghosts. Yeah, very threatening. I think you've just discovered the logical problem in this video. Who is that some nobody? Yeah. That's a cool mic stand. Yeah, Neon has someone else don't know that guy. We're in movies though. Yeah, I buy that mic stand to do the podcast. What's the point of having someone who's not in the movie in the video? Favorite Shot the movie love it. Oh my God, it's so good. How hot is Sigourney Weaver in this movie? Oh, she's fine. Yeah, it's amazing busting makes me feel good and you're not gonna say it's a come reference. Thank you. We have some consistency with the podcast now. What is it crying? He's like getting upset again. Threatening a woman. Okay, is that is that bad? I'm sorry. I got a real sour milk face from my wife on that. So now we had a hey that was what's his name? There's a brief shot of Of the actual actors from sponsors dancing. Okay, we're back. It's very Smith returned. Yeah, do they are in the video? It's a real. Who's who whoever that is. Who's that? Yeah, I don't know. Is that who I was? There are two totally random. Yeah, well that down. All right, that's it plus video write it you want to write. Yeah, let's let's individually rate the meeting. Yeah, I'll start with myself. I guess. What's the rating? It's like one through letter grade school doing let me know whatever I give it. Like I'm gonna go be plus I would give it an a all right, I'm gonna give it a solid B. Hmm. I wish that it didn't lean. So heavily on random people head shots and just like clips from the movie. I wish there was a little more like immersion. Okay, Duncan. What do you think? I know you said letter grades. I'm gonna I'm gonna buy her everything. I like it because because effectively I'm giving it an A-Plus. I'm giving it a 99 out of 100 Wow's cry because it's easy to forget. Of just how hard the song slaps what the song the song rule where it's about the video that video. Shut up songs part of it man. Okay song rules video is great. I love the celebrity cameos. They don't need to be explained. I just get a little bit lost in the dichotomy of Ray Parker jr. Himself being a ghost. I think so emanating for bus. Austin goes I agree. That's why it's not a 100 out of 100 pick a side Ray Parker jr. But a plus 99 out of 100. All right. Maya D D D D is greater than this is a Deeks. It's worse. Hmm seems fair. Okay. I know I think they all exist, you know independently. Our dog is having a sneezing fit. Okay, Maya noted Chad. What did you think? Chad you're recording a podcast right now will point to on a letter grade here you get a 4.2 that's consistent for Chad. Special effects were poor. They look did in an afternoon and then it was done in 1989 or whatever. It was an 89 87 weights earlier. Yeah, when was Ghostbusters? Yeah 86 for before early for and just try and she was pretty high-tech for 84 Frank. What do you I would say low marks for the for the rape rapey Vibes. Hi. For the coming reference so a solid solid see solid C. Okay, Ray Parker jr. More like rape or occur jr. Got them. I got them. My score is still a plus it makes sense of wow ghost and it's advocating for busting ghosts. It's just like Slimer in The Real Ghostbusters. Look it up. Okay plus does okay, but the the weird cameos and Bobby Know that yeah. Well, I love the Cameo. Okay. Alright. Okay. No, you don't like seeing George Wendt say Ghostbusters. Yeah, you're right fair point. They're like early cameos. Yeah. I mean that's it. Just did it to get yeah, you get a star in there. That's all that's all you need. They were just like in the in the studio at the time. They just grabbed whoever was around. They were having lunch and they're like, hey, I got to go to record this stupid music video thing you want to come with Just say the word Ghostbuster have to do you just have to turn to the camera and say two words. Yeah cigarette. Yeah, and they're like, hey is your friend who's waiting for you famous? Yeah, bring them in here. No look at it will do that thing Jason. What would you give it a letter grade for I when I was a kid, I'm gonna I'm trying to go back in time to when I was a kid like I thought Ray Parker jr. Was Lando from Star Wars. I'm no that's awful to say but it's true. Zach is all black people look the same to you. So he I'm sorry, so we cut that out. Did I make a make a racist joke you didn't you didn't know I think I did.

My grandma was like Tina Turner to is your grandma black That's my boy. apart spaces or she a good singer Did you have great thighs do you have do you have some sort of mental disorder where everyone looks like a famous black person dude? No, I don't Terry Crews. I was probably cut all this out. Is that bad? I don't know. I can't tell I guess it's bad. Sorry just bought it when I was a kid. I really did. I'll just Hammer this thing with beeps. Don't worry. Yeah. Okay, Chad just jumped out the window. I might be the only thing I will say that I would like to share about this music video is that I had this on cassette and it was the first it was the first Cassette that I got when I got a Walkman when I was in sixth grade or whatever and I got two cassettes and it was this it was the Ghostbusters soundtrack and I got the labamba soundtrack. Oh, yeah, I had a was not was walk the dinosaur. Well my first table that song also slaps. It's a garbage song at the what the fuck is Frank. I will not sit here. If you didn't you walk dinosaur. Well, it'll be our outro Eric you might recognize her to before. Or a switch is over the door get on the floor everybody walk to dino. Yeah. I know that / that was your first those are first cassette cassette single. Yeah. Wow. I was like 7, I don't know. Yeah. Also, I promise it won't be racist but I think there we go. There we go.

I fucking love Ghostbusters. So I knew they weren't in I was just like yeah, I like it. The guy from cheers likes it. Everybody likes it. I didn't think that your take was racist. FYI. I did not novices. Anybody else got a first cassette story? I think mine was Weird Al Yankovic's off the deep end - Bon Jovi Slippery When Wet oh hell yeah. It was a present. Somebody gave it to me for my birthday. Wow. I specifically asked for Weird Al Yankovic's off the deep end. I think mine was there to be stupid. Hmm my pants. What occurred was I give Frank a dirty? Look first record was bright and then I had Pac-Man Fever. There you go. Also to finish up the fun fact when Huey Lewis sued Ray Parker jr. For copyright infringement. It was secret. It's a secret. Nobody knew about this but part of the settlement was Huey Lewis can never talk about it, huh? But like five years ago Huey Lewis was just like in an interview is like, yeah, I assumed that guy and then we won had to like pay all the money back to him for that day fucking blew it. Really do that one. Then. He lost his human being Ray Parker jr. And phone call. Yeah, right. Hello. I've been waiting for this call. I mean that's been like a massive windfall. Oh, I'm sure there's two things that make me feel good getting all the settlement money back from 25 years ago and busting ghosts Frank. Yeah. I know. Yeah. Yeah.

The video has been viewed more than 10 million times on YouTube, the Daily Dot reports, and it's even gotten its own podcast, The Ray Parker Jr. Ghostbusters Show, which features interviews with the singer and his production company. ""I can't believe I didn't even think to mention that he would be shout-out to Duncan from trivia dot cool for getting me a Ghostbusters Christmas or birthday,"" says the host of the show. ""Isn't this year in from the movie?"" he asks. ""Why are those kids in that haunted house? He's a ghost. Why aren't the stars of ghosts?

Everyone? Alright, so I've been promising to make a podcast for a very long time and I said I would start it in 2020. So it's time to do that. I don't know if anyone's actually going to listen to this, but I'm going to make it. Anyways, I don't have an intro. I don't even know how I'm going to upload this or where I'm going to upload this to but going to do it anyways, so I wanted to start out the whole podcast thing with a pretty important topic for this time of year and that's being successful with whatever goals you set for 2020. Now a lot of people are going to set goals and that's normal. A lot of people may have never even set foot in a gym before and it can be really intimidating but there are things you can do do and the Ways you can approach things that you can actually be successful the first thing to realize that there's millions of people setting New Year's resolutions right now where they already set them but a lot of Statistics show that only like 25 percent of those people actually stick those stick to those goals for even 30 days, which is honestly not that surprising people make unrealistic goals and they just can't stick to them. And those same studies only show that like eight percent of those people actually accomplish the goals that they set which is that's like nothing. So almost all of the people that are going to set goals this time of year don't actually complete them, but I'm going to try to help and give you guys some tips that can put you in that 8 percent you can actually get to where you want to be now. It's not anything. It was the biggest the first biggest issue is just that people set unrealistic goals. You have to be honest with yourself and actually set goals that you can accomplish. You're not going to lose 300 pounds in a year. You're not going to completely transform your body and be a professional bodybuilder in a year going from never working out before in your life. It took you 20 30 years of poor habits to get to are you are now it's going to take it's not going to take that long to correct it but it's going to take some time and it's not something that's going to happen overnight. So the first thing you want to realize is that you don't need to be intimidated by the gym. The biggest thing I see holding people back from even getting started. It's just that they're afraid to go to the gym. They're intimidated by it. This happens with people all the time. I went through this with my parents trying to get them into the gym. Past year and honestly, everyone that gets past that initial intimidation actually goes you you realize that it's not intimidating. So they're the people that you see at the gym. First of all that you think are intimidating. Usually the bigger guys the more fit people the stronger women, whatever it may be most of those people don't give a flying fuck what you are doing there in there to better themselves. They don't care what anyone else is doing and they're focused on themselves and you could be doing the most ridiculous shit in the gym and they don't care they're there for themselves as our most people and then a lot of the other people that are in there are in the same spot that you are their feeling intimidated. They don't really know what they're doing. They're not worried about anyone else. They're just worried what other people are thinking about them and honestly, you don't need to worry about what anyone else thinks now, of course is going to be a few people that might be in there. Judging other people and making fun of people, but honestly, those people are just projecting their own insecurities on others. So even if they have a negative opinion of anyone else in the gym there and Penny their opinion doesn't fucking matter. They're just they're just a well garbage human being but don't worry what anyone else thinks you're in there to better yourself and everyone else in there is in there for the same reasons there whatever their goals are there trying to better themselves, so don't be Intimidated just by going to the gym. Once you go a few times you're going to realize that it's not intimidating. And the other thing when you start out is don't try to compare your progress to other people. Everyone's on their own Journey. You're on your own Journey. You have everyone has a different starting Place. Some people are trying to build muscle. Some people are trying to lose body fat some people who never worked out before in their lives. They're just trying to figure out how to get themselves to the gym. Since some people have been working out for decades and some people have amazing genetics. It's just everyone's at a different place has different potential you want to realize that no matter where you are or what you're doing. You can drastically improve your standpoint from where you're at right now, but some people will see progress so slower. Some will see progress faster. Any progress is progress. It doesn't need to happen overnight. You need to focus on The long-term game and just do the best that you can now once you actually get yourself to the gym. you might see how a lot of people moving a lot of weight doing things that seem a little bit crazy and that might also be intimidating but I see this especially with guys the problem here is people get so caught up with what other people are doing and what they see other people can do they focus so much on how much weight they put on the bar how much weight there lifting when you start out The weight you put on the bar the way you're doing and your movements. It's pretty much irrelevant form overall is so much more fucking important than the weight you're using if you spend the first couple months of your training, obviously you want to focus on getting stronger over the long run. That's what's going to lead to progress. But you really really want to dial in your form. There's a lot of amazing resources on YouTube some on Instagram Facebook, whatever it is for. Online there's so many good resources for videos on how to use correct form. Go study those work on improving it each week. If you can get your form down you're going to set yourself up for a very successful long long duration of progress. It's pretty much one of the most vital things you can do to build a good foundation. If you start out learning to do things wrong and focus on getting stronger. Longer while doing them wrong. It's going to be a hell of a lot harder to correct that years down the road than it is right. Now when you don't have a lot of past experience with those things, you can instill good habits at the beginning so you don't have to worry about correcting them later and it's going to help prevent from injury, which would also set you back and keep you from reaching your goals. So you really want to focus on that and then the other another thing is don't set unrealistic. Big expectations for yourself. I said this before the beginning but when you set unrealistic expectations, you just you're setting yourself up for failure. You're going to get discouraged. You might not get there as fast as you want to and then you give up. I see it happen all the time with people especially people that are working out on their own. They don't have someone to guide them. They think they can do this ridiculous stuff in 30 days to months, whatever a lot of those Transformations you see online are there fucking fake there either photoshopped or manipulated in a bunch of different ways that make them seem a lot more impressive than they actually are and some of them are just outright lies and completely fake. So don't get caught up in like I said before don't get caught up in other people's progress and don't let that set unrealistic. Especially explore the fuck. I can't even talk don't Unrealistic expectations for yourself think of something that's manageable. If you're trying to lose weight losing like one to one-and-a-half not even one and a half like half to one percent of your body weight per week is amazing. That might not seem like much let's say you're 200 pounds and you want to lose 40 pounds. Well one to two pounds a week doesn't seem like very much but in a year, you'll be past your goal and and you're doing it in a sustainable manner that you can actually maintain you're not trying to lose 30 pounds in 30 days anything like that? Yeah, you might see progress faster, but it's a hell of a lot more important that you see progress that you can sustain versus Fast progress. I was like to tell people think about where you want to be like five years from now. So if it take let's say it takes you a year or two years to lose 40 pounds, but you do it in a way that you can sustain You can maintain that progress and you're not going to backtrack afterwards. You'll you can maintain that afterwards and then you'll be in a great standing point in three four five years. You'll be able to keep that look that you get to but let's say you take a really drastic approach. It only takes you two or three months like a quarter of the time to lose that much weight. You lose the 40 pounds awesome. You absolutely crash dieted you run yourself into the ground you feel like shit. If you can't maintain it and then after you lose those 40 pounds you go back to what you were doing before and you gain it all back. Sometimes you even gain more back and then a year down the road you get 50 pounds to lose and then you're mad at yourself. You're not seeing any success and then you just kind of let everything go to shit and then five years down the road. You're in the exact same spot you started so it doesn't really matter how long it takes you to get there. It matters that you're consistently making progress in the right direction, whether that's fast or slow. You just need to make progress. That's all you need to worry about. You don't need to worry about it happening overnight because it's not going to happen overnight and usually if it does happen overnight, it's not something you can sustain. Now after you kind of have a saint a bit plan set in place for realistic expectations and you you're going into the gym and you found a good work. So actually that's an important thing. You want to find a really good workout program. If you can find a coach you can afford a coach that would be your best option because it's they're not only going to set you up with a good plan, but they're also going to help you along the way. You on track and keep you from completely falling off. It's going to be that that outside support can be a huge difference. But let's say you can't afford that there's plenty of options out there for good plans that can teach you a lot and are not very expensive. I would say a really good place to start every most of the people that follow me know. I'm a big proponent of Legion the owner the owner of Legion Mike Matthews. He's written a lot of books two of his books. Bigger leaner stronger, which is the guy version and thinner Lee's leaner stronger, which is the female version by Mike Matthews. You can get those on Amazon super cheap. They're like 10 bucks. Probably the best 10 bucks. You'll ever spend in your life. It covers nutrition and training has multiple training programs and it's all focused on the basics. You don't want to overcomplicate things. You want to just focus on the basics the big compound movements learn how to bench. Learn how to squat learn how to Deadlift if you're intimidated by those you can find regressions from them that are simpler and work your way up but focus on the basics and focus on getting better at them focus on the good form like I talked about before the other thing to keep in mind once you get into the gym and have a good plan in place is don't be afraid to make substitutions for your workout. So let's say You're supposed to do squats or you're supposed to bench and all of that equipment is taken this time of year. If you're just starting out. It's by far the busiest time of the year in the gym. It might be packed, especially if you're working out in the evenings if you're working out in the mornings or early afternoon. You should be just all right, but if you're working out in the evenings might be really packed and you might not be able to get to the equipment you want. Now, I've seen a lot of people that I can't get the workout in I'm supposed to do so, I'm just going to not do anything doing something is so much. Better than doing nothing and you can always substitute a similar exercise for something you're supposed to do. Let's say all the barbell benches are taken. Okay, go do an incline barbell bench or go to the dumbbell section and do a dumbbell bench. If even if all of that's taking go to one of the machines and do a machine chest, press do something same with squats. Let's say you can't squat you could go do a goblet squat with dumbbells. You could go do walking lunges you could do a leg. Press whatever do something. You could do a hack squat find some piece of equipment or something. You can use that's similar and working the same muscles and do it. Now. If you can get what you were supposed to do in the plan that's optimal. But if you're finding something similar that's going to be just great. You just need to do something because doing something is always drastically better than doing nothing. Now another thing to realize once you get into the gym and it's so you're not always going to be motivated when you go to the gym. Honestly motivation in general is just absolute bullshit because it's extremely short-lived. So you might go to the gym first couple days. You're really excited about your goals and you Feel really motivated or whatever you want to call it. Yeah, that's great. It's a great way to get you started but that's not going to last and that's okay. It's just normal. No one's motivated to do something all the time. What's important is that you have a goal set in place or a plan set in place and you just stick to that plan. You need to be you need to have determination about getting to your goal. There's going to be plenty of days when you're not actually motivated. There's going to be days when you don't Want to do absolutely fucking anything is going to be days when you don't want to go to the gym. There's going to be days when you don't want to eat right? Well when that happens, you have to think about the goal. You're actually trying to get to and how important that is to you if you're actually determined and dedicated to getting towards that goal and moving in the right direction. That's what matters sometimes you're not going to feel a hundred percent going into the gym. There's going to be a lot of times you don't feel huh. 3% going into the gym, but going in and getting some work in. Anyways, you're going to be really happy that you did it. Sometimes you just have to get your ass to the gym and do it. You're not always going to be super excited about doing it, but that doesn't matter so stop looking for that motivation or something like you need this specific mindset to be able to do anything just because you don't feel a hundred percent as long as you have a little bit of determination. Asian to get moving towards your goal you just do that and go put in some work that's literally all there is to it so don't get down on yourself if you don't feel motivated because motivation is just fucking bullshit. So just push yourself towards reaching that goal and get in and do it anyways. And that's mostly covers the training aspect of things and let's get into the nutrition aspect of things a little bit because I know a lot of people like I talked about before going to be wanting to make crazy progress and do all these extremes. Well just avoid the biggest advice I can give you is avoid fad diets avoid anything. That's absolutely extreme anything that is restrictive. I mean a dieting Itself, you're going to be restricting some but good way to put this anything that demonizes any specific thing. So anything that's there's good and bad food anything that tells you to cut out certain specific things. That's generally just bullshit. It's a fad diet. There's nothing special about it. If you want to see progress you need to restrict your calories and focus on more nutrient dense foods the best. Advice I can possibly give you if you're just getting started started out is download an app like MyFitnessPal and just start tracking your calories make yourself more aware get yourself a food scale so you can weigh your food out to understand portion sizes and actually how much you're eating because volume measurements can be really inaccurate and even people would have been tracking for a long time are can be horrible at eyeballing portions. I promise you that if you're trying to eyeball your portion sizes, you're completely wrong and almost always Zooming way more than you think you are. So track your Macros track your calories. If you have a good plan set in place, if you got like bigger leaner stronger thinner and leaner stronger the books or you have a good coach. You'll have a way to get macros and calories kind of set up towards your goals and you can work your way towards getting better at those over time. You don't need to be super anal about tracking your calories or tracking your calories. Yes, but You don't need to be need to be super specific about hitting exact macro numbers. Those are just think of those as targets as guidelines. You don't need to hit them. Exactly just kind of be closed think about the ratios that you're aiming for a name to be close to that calories are more important than macros macros are important. I would say the first priority is trying to get enough protein aiming for around Point 8 to 1 gram per pound of body weight and then eating enough fats for healthy hormone. Action and then the rest of your calories from carbs, but if you're just starting out just focus on tracking calories and understanding how much you're actually consuming. There's no such thing as good foods and bad foods. The only way I would view it is it's a spectrum of more nutrient dense foods and less nutrient dense foods. And if you're eating mostly more nutrient dense foods, it's totally fine to include some of those less nutrient dense foods. As long as you track it. You keep an eye on ION portions you practice moderation that's going to be a lot more sustainable in the long run than it doing anything excessively restrictive. I never put my clients on anything really restrictive. It's just it's not sustainable and it's not beneficial for long-term progress. If you are looking for a little bit more information on nutrition in general, I do have an article on my website. That's W Camp coaching.com. You can just go to the article page and there's one on the basics of nutrition and making progress that's going to cover a lot of the nutrition aspects of the things just to help you get a good foundation of knowledge doing that and tracking. Calories in macros you should be on the right track just adjusting them accordingly. If you're not losing weight after a couple weeks you do want to if you have a plan set in place. Let's say a calorie Target a macro Target and you are hitting it. Well don't adjust after not losing weight and a couple days. Sometimes it takes time give yourself like two weeks. And if you're making absolutely no progress then maybe a think about adjusting but give it time progress takes time just because you're not dropping. Being weight right away doesn't mean you're not in a calorie deficit doesn't mean you're not on the right track things take time. So take it slow and just keep a good eye on everything. I would recommend checking your weight at least a few times a week. If not a habit of making it every day. Just so you can get a better idea of progress. You're actually making. Let's see if you download an app like MyFitnessPal you can log your body weight in there and just keep a trend over. Because of time you can see if you're trending downwards. You're always going to have body weight fluctuations. Don't freak out if you gained a couple pounds in one day, you might just be retaining some water. Maybe you got less sleep maybe didn't drink enough water. So that's something a lot of people freak out about when they're getting started out. They'll see these big fluctuations in weight. They'll see a big weight drop and they'll get super excited. They'll see their weight Spike back up no freak out and sometimes say fuck it and then they'll just Go eat like shit because well, I gained a couple pounds. I'm not making progress. No, you're just retaining a little bit of water. You're absolutely fine. Just move forward and be consistent the absolute best advice. I can give you overall is just be consistent be consistent with your training follow the plan get in as many days as you can at least according to your session. You ought to be working out every day, but on top of that try to keep your activity level up giving the that's a I was just going for some walks everyday taking your dog for a walk spending a little bit of time on the treadmill cleaning the house. Whatever. It is something you enjoy whether you enjoy biking or walking or hiking whatever just do some things to stay active and keep your calorie expenditure out that's going to help a lot and then tracking your calories and being consistent with your nutrition. So overall, like I said before setting a goal for yourself is great, but just you have to realize that that goal. It's probably going to take a lot longer than you think it's going to take to get there. And once you get to that goal, it's not over. This is your setting up yourself for the rest of your life. You want to focus on making Lifestyle Changes focus on enjoying your workouts focus on nutrition that you can see yourself falling. Wing for a long period of time and just gradually make changes to push yourself in the right direction because even if you have a goal right now, you might reach that and realize you want to take things further or then you set another goal it never just ends. If it just ends if you get to your goal and say fuck it, I'm done. I'm going back to what I was doing before. You're just going to end up in another few months or a year or a couple years. You'll be right back to where you were before so you have to focus on On changing your habits and being okay with that so make new habits and just don't be too extreme with it. You want to make things that are sustainable and that you can do for the a long period of time. You are at some point you are going to fuck up. Everyone fucks up. Its might happen frequently. It might happen a few times. Let's say you miss a few workouts or you eat like shit for a couple days or you go out and totally blow out your calories you get drunk and then you go eat a bunch of Taco Bell at the end of the night. Well, that's that happens. That's life shit's going to happen. You just got to move forward and go right back to what you were doing before get right back on track. You have to know going into To it that you're not going to be perfect all the time. Everything's not going to be 100% all the time. That's completely fine. You're going to screw up at different points. And as long as you know that going into things and you know how to approach that. You know that you don't need to do some restream extreme restriction after you fuck up. You don't need to just say screw it and give up on everything because you have been consistent for months and then you screw up. One day or one week or a couple days. It doesn't matter. Just go back to it and get back in the groove of things right away, and you'll be just fine. You really have to try to focus on the long run. I see so many people that get hung up when they have one little slip-up or whatever whether it's training nutrition. Just being lazy or even let's see you injure yourself or you get sick and then you don't want to get back to doing anything. Just go back to normal. You'll be just fine moving. Don't let little stupid things like that. Get you hung up and stop you from actually progressing towards your goals. So just realize that that's going to happen at some point and fucking up to some degrees completely normal. You just have to get back on track and keep moving forward. I guess that's about it. I'll leave with one really good piece of advice that I absolutely love and that is you need to work out because you love your body not because you hate it. It's great to set goals for yourself. It's great to want to better yourself. But if you're trying to change things because you absolutely hate your body. It doesn't matter how far you progress yourself. It doesn't matter what physique you get to or how much weight you can lift whatever if you are in that. Type of negative mindset at the end of the day. It doesn't matter where you get to it's probably not going to change that mindset and you're still going to feel that way. You have to come to terms with that you're training you're eating better because you love your body and you want to live a long happy successful life not because you absolutely hate where you're at right now and you're just trying to punish yourself from what you were doing in the past. That's not going to get you anywhere. It's not going to put you in a healthy mindset. So Workout because you love your body not because you hate it. And that's going to be it for my first podcast.

If you're like most people, you set those goals and then, well, you don't stick to them. In fact, only 25% of people stick to their New Year's resolutions for at least 30 days, according to statistics cited by Deadspin. That's why Penny Hoarder, a professional bodybuilder and personal trainer, started her own podcast, The Penny Hoarder Show, to help people set and stick to their New Year's resolutions.

So everyone matters in so, you know, I feel like there's definitely helped me, you know to this point.What's up, everybody? Welcome to another edition of boot up the LSU basketball podcast. I'm Cody worship digital media reporter Brandon Smith Athletics. Glad you could be with us today. Got a very special edition of The Show for you sat down for about a 15 minute conversation with LSU freshman forward Trend in Watford this interview took place last week after LSU knocked off, Arkansas.At home to improve 22.0 in the conference. They've won two more games since then trendin was fantastic and that Arkansas game. He was fantastic again. Last night is LSU went on the road and beat Texas AM to improve to four in a row on the conference. LSU hasn't lost a game in two seasons on the road in the SEC, which is one of the best accomplishments in college basketball. If you ask me, it's really hard to win on the road anywhere especially in a league with as much parody As the SEC and Anna was a big part of that last night. I believe you finished with 19 points 11 rebounds 6 assists and he's really coming into his own. I will do some more analysis of this team in the coming weeks with some more episodes today. I'm going to stick with just the interview with trendin and some of you may be like me where you were so caught up in football that basketball hasn't quite gotten the attention that you normally give it. I regret that I wish there was something I could do about it, but I have a lot of responsibilities with football especially during football season, especially when the team is having the success. Pad so I've tried to give as much attention of as well as I could you've heard me talk about them as podcast. If you've been listening if you haven't been listening and you're just joining in to listen to this podcast and kind of getting back into basketball mode welcome. I'm excited about this basketball season. This team is really good there for and on the conference. They've won a couple games that maybe they shouldn't have one. If you look at it just statistically or maybe the way the game felt the the game-winning shot that Skylar hit the other night was phenomenal against us against Mississippi State. Maybe that's a game that LSU quote-unquote shouldn't have won by the metrics by some of the numbers. But if you remember we'll wait talked in the build-up to the conference play and I believe we played this on the show. In fact, we did played on the show. He talked about the fact that LSU lost a couple games in the non-conference that they felt they should have won with USC and Utah State any hope that would even out. Well, it's starting to even out. I don't know if LSU's won two games that they shouldn't have one, but they were almost a fortunate but things went their way and the right way to be Mississippi State. I thought they'd help. Arkansas to win that game, but they needed some late heroics from training to win that game as well. But things are starting to even out there. So it's good to see the teams playing. Well, they're doing some things really well to help them when they still have a lot of work to do though. Not only in terms of taking care of the conference late as the schedule gets tougher and tougher as conference goes on but they also have some things to improve within themselves. So we'll talk about all that will break that down. I've got some plans. I've got some people that I want to bring on the show. I plan to do some more player interviews. I have one with him it Williams in my back pocket that I'm going to use in a future episode. So I've got plenty of basketball coming your way. I'm going to hit it hard. I promise another footballs done and that's in the rearview mirror jumping straight into basketball full steam ahead. You guys have an expectation for me those that have been listening for a while of the type of basketball coverage that I'm going to do. Hope to meet or exceed those expectations coming up. So again, thanks for your patience. If you've been waiting for more episodes, there will be more episodes coming up promised at least one a week, maybe two one weeks where it makes sense, so All about that and again, if you're new to the show, if you're just coming over from football if if you've been caught up in football or you've never really listen to this podcast before welcome and I'm excited about what's coming ahead. So let's go ahead and get to the interview with turn and wide for a really good conversation turned into a real sharp guy just as good of an interviewer as he is or interviewee. I guess as he is a basketball player and a good conversation with Trend and we get into some of his history and how he became as good as he is hinda. I kind of gave him some Look because look I don't think it's fair. I don't think it's fair that someone can be that tall and that's killed and that talented if you're that tall, you should just be not very skilled. Like you should just be able to play around the rim in my opinion as a guy who played the game and was not tall and not particularly skilled either but I tried to emphasize this skill more in my personal game being six foot tall. I thought that might be necessary and then I see guys that are 610 like Trend and who can step out and shoot threes. They can handle it on the on the fast break and then go put up 1911 to 6 in the SEC and it just makes me a little jealous. So we talked about I was turning we talk about his history growing up as a Lakers fan and what it was like to play in the Staples Center where Kobe Bryant his Idol played and where his favorite team played growing up. So lots of good stuff with Trend that's going through that interview again. I'll be back LSU's foreign on the conference. There's lots of talk basketball wise we're going to stick with just the interview for today. Allow me some time to dig into the film learn a little bit more about this team that I know just from the few games that have been able to catch in full and I'll be back with with much more in-depth takes on this. Team and conversations about this team. So again here without further Ado. Is that interview with LSU freshman for Trend in Watford? All right good to sit down for a few minutes with LSU freshman Fortran and Watford training. We picked a good time to do this interview. I guess credit to Caleb for setting this up, but you had a pretty good game last night. Would you say that's the best game that you've played so far 21 points or is it nine rebounds a couple big buckets late? They are against Arkansas. Is that the best game of your career so far? Oh, yeah, I think no that's definitely one. Miss ones I had What do you think is has happened for you these last few games where you started to round that corner? Obviously, you have all the talent in the world 610. You can handle it. You can shoot it. You can drive it but it seems like these last couple games in particular starting to get really comfortable what's happened in that time where you're trying to find that Comfort. Well just get more comfortable with the game. You know, I feel like I feel like the games got a little slower for me, you know early on it was pretty fast paced game, you know, I had the master physicality, but you know, I felt I just watch them film watching Family closure with coach hire its help. A lot of so I feel like you know, that's definitely you know, a big reason why you know, I'm just starting to be consistent with it's one of the things that you know, when I watch you play I kind of think to myself it's not fair. It's not fair that you're that big and that skill like you shouldn't be able to have both my opinion because when I played like I wasn't as big obviously I wasn't a skilled either but you know, it's just not fair. I don't think you should be that big and that talented but which came first was at the size or was it the talent that came first for you the size the size. Definitely. I've always pretty much been. Unlike pretty much tall so, you know and I was always just work just worked on my perimeter game a lot, you know, like coming up. My dad used to never let me like really play in the post. You just used to always like let me put on me a lot of input on Perimeter. So I would say they're pretty much just help me all the way until you know until I just trying to plan on the post and then they are you know, both of those just kind of mix together when you talk about being a big kid, like put it in perspective for me. Were you always like the tallest kid in your class? Like were you one of those things where you kind of naturally gravitated toward a spot on your brother played, but did you stab? One other sports what was kind of your athletic career like coming up now, I've always wanted to play basketball but you know just always being the biggest I was being the biggest kid in the classroom, you know, everybody everybody, you know, eventually going to say you I know you play basketball and we play football but it was basketball for me because I was just always follow my brother around you does as a young kid just always been behind him. So, you know just say that was pretty much the reason so a lot of people know this but some don't that your brother was very good basketball player played in Indiana hit that famous shot and Assembly Hall against Kentucky. What are your memories of just And of his career, what's the age Gap there? I know he's he's a big influence on you. I see him at all the games and everything, but just what's your relationship like with him and as he was growing up being an elite player and kind of how you followed in his footsteps. Well, I release it was very strong, you know, he's living out here now, so, you know, just you know, when he was coming up. I was just always around him. Are you high school college, even if he was even if he's playing in the pros, so, you know, I was just always been around him just been watching him play. So, you know, it's definitely helped me, you know to this point so, you know just being around him in college and during atmospheric Like yesterday, you know, I've always just been around it. So, you know, it definitely helped me when you're when you're watching him play and come up and he's playing in big games. Do you feel like that's help you most from like the mental side where when you're in a big moment like yesterday. Yeah. It doesn't seem too big or is it something where you kind of knew like? Okay. This is what it takes training wise like physically to get there. How did it which way is it helped you the most this is help me, you know, they just keep calling. You know, I've always just you know, I've seen him play, you know to see him play in atmospheres like that. So, you know, it's just always help. Me and you know just play early just playing earlier in the college career like and just sold out Arenas against like VCU and stuff. You know, I would say that was pretty much the that was pretty much the first time where I was like, you know, like it's real like he's actually no college basketball. So, you know, that's definitely helped me. How old were you when you realize you got a shot not just to be, you know, a good basketball player like the best kid in your class, whatever but like okay like the biggest schools in the country are coming after me. I'm going to be a five star kid at what point did it kind of turned for you or you knew you were gonna be that kind of talent I would say I would say my Great my eighth grade year eighth grade summer, you know, I started going to like, you know, pretty much National camps and stuff. So there's a lot of like Scouts looking at me and stuff and then, you know just start getting recognized by college coaches and stuff. Damn. So I was pretty much had my eighth grade year. It's like the biggest thing you've overcome biggest obstacle guy as talented as you with the size that you've had think there might be a perception like he's just so naturally gifted but you've obviously worked hard to get where you are and I'm sure there's some things you have to overcome. What are the biggest challenges because hurdles you had to overcome in your career one of the biggies. Has her toes, I probably had to overcome and they pretty much changed. My basketball career is when I think is my tenth grade. Yeah, I got cut from the USA national team. And you know, I will pretty much say that was the biggest obstacle that I had to overcome. You know, just I work I work so hard just try to make the team and I end up getting cut but you know to put everything in perspective, you know, you got always work harder and you know, just just believe in yourself. So have you transformed since then did you attack certain aspects of your game? But you work on your body? What were the biggest things you learned from that they had? After that, you know, I just started I just started working hard just stand in the gym a lot and they're staying working on my brother a lot. And then you know that that next year after that. I'll just start changed my body and just working on my body a lot. So that was pretty much it. I think it's safe to say that you you work and you work out in an interesting locker room with some interesting guys some big personalities Emmett who was just walking by Darius or some big Personalities in there. How do you kind of fit into that mold? Are you more of a laid-back guy? Do you like to get in there and mix it up with them? How do you kind of fit? It personality-wise with the steam. Oh, we all fit. We all feel good. You know, I feel like they've when I got here they welcomed me with open arms, you know, I had already had a close relationship anyway, and she wants a Smart there is day. So, you know, I was pretty much gel together pretty good and you know all of us just as close as you were just like Brothers now, so what was your like welcome to college moment like the moment where you realized? Okay, this isn't high school basketball anymore. Maybe it was in the summer with Greg golden working out or maybe it was Will Wade making you run sprints or something. What was That moment for you, I would say, you know just going again. I'll probably say going to use dairies days and Evan Williams a lot. You know, I was always on the opposite team other opposite team them so, you know just having to box them out of stuff, you know, sort of gave me a welcome to college, you know, welcome to college, you know, just welcomed. So just being from that just just them boxing me out and them just you know, pushing me around when I got here, you know, it was just it was just a welcome college experience. So how is so far your experience at LSU measured up to expectations. I know you come in in high expectations for yourself personally high expectations for the team. But also just the experience that going to classes and being around students going to football games. How is that kind of measured up to what you expect and what's been different what's been kind of what you expected owes more than I expected. You know, I'm loving it here, you know, obviously the football teams having a great year. So he knows a lot of hype around campus and I just met I met great people, you know, since I've been here so, you know, I was just say it's definitely been a great experience getting to play with with Darius and Emmett. I think you all have a very unique Line up because Daris is almost like a four man who admits kind of like a four or five your kind of a guy that can play all the cross. You can play this big lineup. It's big in terms of size, but they're still all the skill there of a smaller line of how much fun is that to play in What challenges does it pose with opportunities is a present. Oh, it's definitely fun playing with them. You know, we're big lineup seeking lines six seven, six five six six. So, you know, I think you know, I think that's definitely an advantage to us, you know, obviously we're doing you know, we're doing good on the glass. So that's definitely an advantage for us. You know just being big across the line. So it definitely helps us and you know, we just all love playing with each other. Let's talk about free throw shooting because we talked about it last night at the at the press conference and obviously that's been a big part of your last two games. I think you're like 12 years last 14. You're a good shooter. I mean we can all see that you can you can knock down shots, but there was that time early in the season where you're probably shooting. I don't know below 60% or something at what point did you think to yourself? Right? I need to work on this and this is something I need to dedicate to it. How have you gotten from that point where you were struggling at the line to where you are now where? Are making big free throws in big moments. I would say I would say after the a lot of take game. It was just an exhibition game, but I had missed like six free throws and you know ever since then I was just watching film on just my balance and stuff and you know, eventually man because wages got together. I was just like, you know, you just wanna work together on free throws after practice every day. So, you know, we shoot 50 free throws and you know just have to be able to make a 9 out of 10. So everyone matters in so, you know, I feel like that's definitely helped me, you know to this point well was talking about it last night. He said that You know at first when we were first doing it, it would take a little while. And then now it's almost surprising when you don't make that twenty two out of 25 that 9 out of 10. You remember some of those early days be in there a little bit longer. How long like what was like the longest you were in there for? Oh, no, it was just it was time to everybody everybody at the gym mean. It was just still in there me I'm just feeling they're trying to you know, just correct it and make free throws. But yeah, it was definitely it was definitely a hard time, you know earlier in the year. Just trying to correct it and You know, I think you know now you know now it's just about there. So do you think like what's helped most is just the physical repetition of working at so many times or did you develop a routine? Did you develop something that made you more comfortable with the line? How did you kind of turn that corner? I've changed my routine. If you look if you look at early in the year, I was doing the you know, my feet were not so spread it out apart and I didn't leave back and then rock into it but it's definitely, you know, definitely changed my routine and I took my time, you know, just start taking my time at the line with even more so I felt It's definitely helped me just you know, just calm down and just knocking me. How did you develop that routine? I remember being like a kid in the way that I would shoot free throws. I just watched somebody like yeah, that's a big JJ Reddick fans will try to shoot like JJ Redick or you know, if I was in a slump I try to mimic somebody else. Did you mimic someone did you come up with something that just made you comfortable? How did you kind of develop their routine if you if you look if you know focusing on looks at what I do laying back and down sort of rock into it and I get that from a bar on but you know, he does it and you know, it was just One day I was just doing it. I just noticed I started making free throws my balance was you know my balance which is good. So, you know, I would say I got different film and there's definitely Heaven. Are you a LeBron guys that like your guy I mean, I know you guys idolized a lot of different players, but who's your guy are you like LeBron guy Kobe? Come on Kobe. Yeah. That's right. You're like most everything pretty much every game. I'm wearing Kobe's and I broke actually a pair of broke last night the first pair I was wearing the first half ended up breaking so I had to change them at halftime. When did you become a Lakers fan? Is that something that started when you were young? Yeah me and my dad's is always a Lakers fan, you know ever since I was young. So I was always just have Kobe jerseys and stuff like that. What's like your first Kobe memory? Like the first game was like the 81-point came out on how you older. You know, I think it was the game. It was the game where they want where they want the championship against Boston and then I end up I had a mean Kobe. I think my ninth grade year the summer. So yeah, that was pretty much that was pretty much the real quick. What do you like about him? Because there's a lot of guys your age that that Kobe's almost like old school for them. Really for me because he's Jordan feels old-school to me, but there's so many guys your age that are LeBron guys, or whoever, but what about Kobe appeal to you others like his mentality, you know, he's obviously a great score, but he's a great competitor and everything he does so, you know, just like his mentality and just how used to take over games and stuff like that. So how cool was it for you to play in Staples Center and not only play in Staples Center, but you had a really good game at Staples Center. What was what was that day? Like take me into the locker room. Did you guys like see I know it's a big facility, but did you see you? A core stuff. Was it kind of like a cool moment for you? Yeah, actually when I when we walked in you can see like all the Lakers pictures Kobe pictures and stuff and we were actually in the we were actually in the locker room and Lakers locker room. So I stink I said Anthony Davis locker and Charles Mann and sit right next to me a little bronze like this. He's the bar fan. So, you know that was pretty surreal and it's walking out you look up and you see you know, the 8/8 no, h8, Jersey and the 24 jersey retired. So it was pretty it was pretty it was pretty crazy. And then the play as well as you did. I think they should Brother a couple of times and chords that he was fired up on a you were you were fired up. You didn't get the win and that's that's something that I'm sure you've learned from as a game you could have won but it's to have a good game and they're to play in there. What was that experience like the game experience itself? I was crazy, you know, obviously it was a great game. It was just a competitive game and you know, we definitely learned from it, you know, you know watching film the next day and we just learned from my mistakes, but it was just all right. I was just a great great experience just to play on statement, of course. Oh, so in addition to the 50 free throws or the 25 free throws a 9 out of 10 you just work with ties after every practice, right? What are you working on with Tasman? And how awesome is that to have a guy that you look around? This building is his numbers his stats are every one of the greatest players notice you history to have him as a resource where y'all working on and just how cool is that we work on just finished the through contact, you know, we we do five shots on the Block five scotches driving a left down the same, you know just five shots on the other blogging is driving right down the seam so, you know, it's definitely like he's all he has a pan and stick so I got to finish the street. Say and yesterday the first and one that was just a representation of what I do every day with him after practice. So I'll definitely say it's paying off and just great working with him. So what's next for you in terms of your individual development? You've got the free throws down. It seems like I know you want to build on that. You've been rebounding. Well, you've been scoring. Well, what do you want to order? Your focus is on your game right now where you trying to prove just being mentally like then, you know before SEC play started me and Causeway just talked about, you know, that was the biggest thing that unites us with a child. Me to do just be mentally locked in and I'm just dialing, you know, it's hard as I can for every game just before every game and just my mental preparation. I would say there's my biggest thing and just try to stay consistent from a team perspective. He walked into a program that one sec championship last year guys are off to a no start. You've had a taste of SEC play. Now, where does the team need to go from here? I know you lost. Some games are not conference. The I want back. What's the next step for you guys as a team just coming here, you know just coming here. Don't get complacent. You know, I would say just starting out too. Those who graced our and you know, obviously got a lot of got a lot of more games, you know left the place. So I was just saying you're just a consistent stay hungry and you know, just don't get complacent. All right last one for you. This is a off-topic question. I call it my Caleb question because he makes me ask everybody Give Me Your Space Jam team. I want you to build me your dream team. You're on the team. Okay, you got to surround yourself with four NBA players. All right dizzy. Yeah, you're on the team and you got four teammates NBA players you can anybody. E from past present whatever you want build your dream team built around you and you guys got to play for the the fate of the world point guard. I'm going I'm going to Michael Jordan. It's you going I'm going Kobe and small forward. I'm going to me a power forward. I'm going to Kevin Durant and instead I'm going to say that's a pretty good team. I like your finishing with Shaq with Ellis you guys. All right turn appreciate your time.","– A Louisiana State University basketball player has been kicked off the team for an ""unsportsmanlike"" Instagram post, the Times-Picayune reports.

I decided to leave the domestic games to one side and we focusing on the road to Tokyo.

Fires as pain in Spain for France as their dreams are crushed by the red sticks. The Netherlands are on their way to Tokyo. But Irish Hearts were broken by a video nasty. I'll take a look ahead at Great Britain's matches with Malaysia for the men's qualifiers and chilies for the women's there's all this and plenty more coming up. So without further Ado let's get crackin. But of course before we get into all that it's time for this week's Who Am I quiz if you haven't listened before it's nice and easy, I give you three Clues over the course of the show. You have to guess who the mystery hockey player is here's the first clue. I was born on the 28th of October 1980. Or in Hamburg Germany and I've spent all bomber one season of my club career playing from my home club, uh see that clue again. I was born on the 28th of October 1984 in Hamburg Germany, and I've spent all bar one season of my club career playing from my home club, uh, see any ideas might be an easy one for some might be difficult for others. Anyway, if you haven't got that dough, don't worry. There's another clue coming up very shortly. So here we go. Then the 10 days that will make or break. The Olympic dreams of hockey's top athletes has begun. The FH is Olympic qualifying playoffs came roaring into action with some fantastic hockey some interesting score lines. And at least one huge talking point. I've seen some people on social media question in the system for qualifying saying there's too much riding on two games in A short space of time I've seen some people say there should be full on tourneys involving more than the two teams in each game. I can see that point of view and before the games got underway. I assumed that with such high stakes with zkg games where the higher-ranked side eventually prevailed give them the evidence of the first weekend of matches. I was definitely wrong about the kg side of things. So what I'll do is I'll give you a quick rundown of what's happened in the match. Has so far and then pick up a couple of points that I want to address in a little more detail. So first up a look at the women's Olympic qualifiers, Australia have booked their tickets Tokyo after seeing off Russia in their two game playoff in Perth again won the hockey Reus scored twice in the first two minutes A Dream start. Thanks to goals from Emily choker and Amy Lawton and although Russia pulled one back in the first quarter and then leveled through Alina. Klimova Grace Stewart's goal and another from choker put Also using control going into game to game two is bit more routine. The Australians scored a double through Mariah Williams, and then another one each for Chalker and Stewart and a goal for Sophie Taylor secure Australia's slot in the Tokyo games elsewhere Adrian locks Spain project continues rolling on as they saw of Korea to ensure they qualify for the Olympics once again, they did. All behind to a penalty corner from he Sun Yang in game one the lovely poachers effort from Berlin Iglesias a well-taken penalty corner from Lola riera gave them a slender Advantage going into game two in game two. Begonia Garcia settled any Spanish nurse. There may have been with the opening goal after the goalkeeper and Defender gotten a terrible mess on the goal line and then riera slotted in a penalty stroke and it was all over for Korea and a Tokyo for Spain the final tithe take place in the women's qualifiers. This weekend was China vs. Belgium was looking good for Belgium. After game one, where an early goal from Dual bun and a late goal from Stephanie Vandenberg a the matter to nil lead going into game two. Everything seemed to be fine for Belgium in game two. The lead was intact until four minutes from time when Bing vangu slotted home from the penalty spot to give China a glimmer of hope then Credibly my you liang's cross was diverted into her own net by Alex Gurney here to make that to take the match into a shootout as one all after five each which took it into Southern death and then jike wheelies scored meaning Alex Gurney has her of the own goal in normal time. She had to score to keep Belgium minute her effort went wide and China took the win and a place in the Olympics and the advertising hoarding behind the goal. Cole took a bit of a battering from the Belgium strike a stick massive for China but absolute heartbreak for Belgium, but very exciting for us watching at home. So the qualifies for the women's Olympic competition so far are as follows, Japan Argentina, Australia China Netherlands, New Zealand South Africa and Spain there are still four places up for grabs and we'll find out who takes those. This coming weekend. So it's now time for the second clue in today's Who Am I quiz? So here we go. Second clue is in a glittering career. I have won two Olympic gold medals and Olympic bronze medal and a World Cup. I've also won the Euro hockey league three times that clear again in a glittering career. I've won two Olympic gold medals and Olympic bronze medal and a World Cup. I've also won the Euro hockey league three times to any idea who that is. Don't worry. If you don't know there is another clue coming up before the end of the show, right? Then here we go time to have a look at the three ties that took place over the weekend in the men's Olympic qualifiers. I'll rattle through the first two and save the one that everyone is talking about until last so Spain join their women's side in booking a place at Tokyo after they saw off a very strong Challenge from European Rivals France the first match of this time as an absolute belter France raced into a three nil lead thanks to goals from Victor Charles A Gaspar baumgarten and Al Murray Bellinger and after 29 minutes. I was 3-nil up must have been absolutely Overjoyed with that start even though Spain pulled one back through from a Chevy learner penalty stroke France were in an extremely strong position in the 41st and 50th minutes though as a soft and been the case for Spain over the years Power Commander stepped up slotted into penalty corners and made it 3-3 going into the deciding game in game two baumgarten de France the leave with a nap. Solutely brilliant goal, he drove the Baseline and lifted it over the goalkeeper from close range Miguel delos and Alvaro Iglesias put Spain ahead. But Francois GUI leveled it up at five five overall in the 39th minute, but parity lasted just one minute as Chevy Leonor. Once again put Spain back in from France for everything at them. But in the end it was the red sticks who held on and it's them who will be going to Tokyo. Fantastic two games and even though Spain took the place and even though it will be very little consolation to France. They showed once again that they're getting closer and closer to Europe's top sides all the time. You remember no doubt that they reached the quarter finals of the World Cup something that I predicted on galvanized have keys prediction show of course, and if they can keep building on those sorts of performances like this, they'll be competing on an even footing with the best sides around. He soon Netherlands vs. Pakistan was a very entertaining tie first match finish for for Pakistan executing their penalty Corners brilliantly to Spring what can only be described as a surprise result at the end of the day end of the game at the Dutch probably looked at mink vanderveer Dan's last minute goal that made it for four and thought they probably got away with one a bit there a second game the Dutch class Jean through vanderveer and scored two. More and there are further calls from Beyond Kellerman Mirko preiser Terrence Peters. And you Hanson. They only let it to give the Dutch a 6-1 win. If you haven't seen the highlights, I'd strongly urge you to watch them on the FH Facebook page the atmosphere inside. The stadium is superb the penalty Corner Clinic Pakistan conducted in the first game is well worth a look and Beyond Kellerman's goal in the second game is a thing of beauty like really well worth the watch. Now then deep breath Canada versus Ireland before I go into this. I should make clear. I hate it when people criticize umpires. I hate it when people blame the outcomes the game on the officials have the utmost respect for umpires and officials. I understand it is a very difficult job. And without them there won't be a game. I accept all that and ordinarily I'd steer well clear of any top. Make the calls out officials because I think it sends the wrong message. And I don't think it's the right road to go down. But the second match of this too much playoff ended up being decided by an Umpire in decision a video empowering decision and I'm afraid that can't be ignored. That is the major talking point of the of the contest. So here we go for context Ireland won the first match 5 3 over 2 one down in the second match. ouch, and that meant overall they were six five up and heading to the Olympics seconds left on the clock leak whole attempted to tackle Canada's James Wallace in the circle Wallace went down the on field umpire signaled a 16 and blue the full time whistle Canada asked for a video referral the video on pyre decided the decision was a penalty stroke Scott Tucker scored to make it six six and the Went on to win the shootout and qualify for the Olympics instead of Ireland firstly. I've seen some comments on Twitter saying the final whistle had gone. So Canada should not have been allowed to refer that's not correct. The incident happened whilst the game was still going on. They immediately asked for the referral it's as far as the rules go, they were quite within their rights to do. So, so that's that dealt with no issue on that. I've seen some dissenting voices some posts on social media claiming corruption accusations of bias questioning the Integrity of the F IH the officials Etc. I don't agree with that at all. I think I think that's proper tinfoil hat territory. It's not a conspiracy or anything like that. But what I would say is the if I just go to describe. Incident itself and the Fallout and they're sort of where I am on that and then you can guess make up your own minds from there. Obviously appreciate a podcast is not a visual medium so that you to visit the BBC sport website and watch the incident for yourself, but essentially the attacker drives towards the Baseline the crowded Circle The Defender tries to reach to make a tackle the attacker appears to step on the defender stick causing him to fall as I said earlier the on on field umpire signals are 16 and blows for full-time and Ireland think they've done it. the rules on a penalty stroke State that's a penalty stroke is awarded for an offense by a defender in the circle which prevents the probable scoring of a goal or for an intentional offense in the circle by Defender against an opponent Who has possession of the ball or an opportunity to play The Boom Now as I see it for point a I think from the angle the attackers going the speed is going the area of the circle. He's in the number of Defenders and goalkeeper around deeming that to be a probable goalscoring opportunity as a bit of a stretch. Obviously, it's my opinion. It's open to debate and criticism and there are people far better qualified than me to sort of make judgments on that. But my feeling is it would take something extremely special to Go from there, and I don't deem that to be a probable goalscoring opportunity point B and intentional offense in the circle by Defender against an opponent Who has possession of the ball and opportunity to play the boom to me. That's an attempted flatstick tackle. The defender only has eyes for the bull he's intent on making a tackle to win the ball cleanly and the contact with the attackers foot is as much down to the attackers movement. As it is to The Defenders movement. I'd say a penalty Corner would maybe be a fair decision. But to deem that to be an intentional foul is again my opinion a massive reach for me and I don't believe that that's the correct outcome. If you don't believe me just find out what island Captain Jonathan Bell thinks of it. Here's his post match interview. Terrible decision in the last moments of the game is much stronger out us today to pretty even gear and we chances their chances and we did have a couple chances take the game away from them. But as I say I decision I got this level is just not acceptable. Thank you. So no pull no punches pulled their one of the shortest that most matter-of-fact post-match interviews. You're ever likely to hear to be honest given how he was probably feeling he's been quite restrained there in my opinion as I've seen a lot of content comments across social media and a lot of rooted in emotion and anger a lot of people, you know jumping to conclusions throwing wild accusations around I've tried Kind of cut through the noise and pull out a couple of salient points for discussion in an attempt to work out what's happened and try and get some sort of understanding. The first thing that I did find of interest is that there was some question marks over the technology and the video angles available to the video on pyre Stephen finned later of hook hockey. He tweeted during the early stages the first game TV production having a hole a world of issues with showing the replays but video and by has no advice possible. So PC stands a big worry about the quality of video angles on offer that was at Neil Neil in the early stages of the first match of the too much Series so long before the key decision in team in game two. I've not seen anything from the FH about the video on pyre facilities or the angles available the feed I watched was not the best. It's pretty Court follow the angle shown on the replay whilst the umpires making the decision weren't that great either maybe the video on pie had access to angles and footage that we watching at home didn't I don't know. What I do know is that that tweet from Stevens suggests that there are concerns early on about the sort of the angles available to them and what I would also say if the video on Pearl was using the same video I could see it's hard to see how they could have been expected to make clear and fair decisions based on the footage available. So as we know there appeared to be some concerns and a few issues at the video in the first game and I know a number of journalists have put in requests the FH for clarification of what angles were available. You do kind of worried about that. It's part of a wider point with hockey that the quality of the video referral facilities seems to differ wildly from venue to venue and tournaments, too. Moments is not doing the game any favors when the impression is that some matches and some venues the video employers cannot do their jobs to the standards. We expect to firm because I don't have the correct the correct equipment or facilities to do. So for a game of this importance. I find it very difficult to comprehend the situation could arise where a video on prayer is not able to see every angle to make the correct decision that being said and obviously that is just me speculating because I don't know and I know checking just before recording. None of the journalists have heard back about what video angles were available. Of course, there is the possibility that the video and I did have access to angles that we at home did not see but if that's the case, why don't you FH come out and say this it might not quite and down the baying mob with their pitchforks and their flaming Which is barred and I think it might it might help clarify things a little bit. I have seen a number of people say the FH should come out and explain the decision and how it has arrived at and I know BBC sport contacted them for a statement, but we're told umpires decisions are final and as a general principle FH does not comment publicly on individual umpiring decisions. So obviously we've seen in the Rugby World Cup the world rugby governing body came out and Jesus some decisions made a Believe In The Island V Japan match, so I don't see why the F IH can't do the same. Now. I appreciate that. We people screaming at their device. Now who disagree with this saying that's a dangerous precedent to set you don't want to get into a situation where every time someone disagrees with an umpire's decision. They expect an official explanation and that is a slippery slope that we don't want to get down a stage where we're doing that forever. You came but what I would say is this is an exceptional circumstance. It's not just another decision in just another game Ireland's and Canada's place at the Olympic Games The Pinnacle of the sport depended on the outcome of this decision. Not just that but funding sponsorship livelihoods careers by any metric. This was a huge decision with a lot riding on it if the FHA saying the video and pie made the At call, which personally I don't believe he did. Why don't they come out and explain that why don't they come out and back that don't Ireland deserve that don't Canada deserve to have the sheen restored to their achievement of reaching the Olympics. As I say I just think there's a lot of unanswered questions out there. There's a lot of angry people out there. It isn't a usual situation. It is an exceptional circumstance and I think it would be very worthwhile for the FH to try and clear this up. I'm not sure if any of this section makes sense to be honest. My thinking is a bit jumbled around the whole thing. I feel desperately sorry for Canada because I feel like their joy and their achievement of reaching the Olympics has been tainted by this controversy and I feel even more sorry for Ireland because losing in that fashion is is horrendous to put it mildly and perhaps the last word on the matter just for some food for thought is a tweet from Davy heart. One of the islands goalkeepers hockey careers ended Olympic dream shattered and years and years of nothing but hard work and dedication from all players. Finished honestly still can't believe what happened a decision that will carry pain for a lifetime heartbroken. There you go. Well, that was that was quite heavy after all that let's lighten the mood with the final clue in The Who Am I quiz here we go final third and final clue. I made over 250 appearances for Germany and scored over a hundred goals and was voted F. IH World Player of the Year. 2012 clue again, I made over 250 appearances for Germany scored over a hundred goals and was voted F IH World Player of the Year in 2012 and the ideas fear not if you haven't got it, although I think that would have clinched it for many people, but the answer is coming up very shortly. So we've looked at the Olympic qualifiers which have happened. And now there's the small matter of the ones coming up. This coming week ends at the Lee Valley Hockey and Tennis Centre in London Great. Britain will do battle with chili in the women's competition and with Malaysia in the man's an Olympic Games birth is on the line. So let's have a look at what we can expect. So the teams they face first up quick. Look at chili. He will represent a new challenge for Mark Hagar side. The two teams have never met in a major tournament. Chili A ranked 18th in the world finished fourth at the recent Pan American games where they lost to Argentina in the semi-finals and then lost the bronze medal match to the USA of a player called Manuela Roth who has played Club hockey in Belgium for Royal Antwerp and more recently in the Netherlands for on your road. She is probably their biggest goal threats called 13 International goals in 2019. I think including seven penalty Corners, so she will be a big threat. She has a lot of experience International level and of European hockey from people. I've spoken to who know a lot more about these things for me. I've been told chili style is and a bit like a sort of Argentina light. So last year I blast will be physical hard-working have an aggressive press plenty of The visual Flair and I'm sure give Great Britain a run for their money. What can we expect from the host? Perhaps Captain Holly pan web can shed some light on the situation. I caught up with her last week and here's how she sees it going. It's been a tough few months with the pro league in the Euros not going maybe the way you would have wanted. But how are you guys sort of feeling going into these Olympic qualifiers? I think it's really important to look at the bigger picture in terms of sort of what's happened in the last year in terms of absolute losing our through injury and and and I've seen it through injury and and having some players like shown a comeback and so a lot of our senior players and then obviously changing coaching staff. So I think yeah, it has been like a Yes so far, but if you look at the bigger picture terms of what's happened. It's very much a sort of big new average new Young Squad new team and obviously the new head coach in place. So I think it was just inevitable. It was going to take a bit of time for his daughter to jail. So I don't think it's looking back in and sort of panic stations. I think it's that works, even though it didn't go to exactly how you wanted it. That stuff is still benefited Us in the long run in terms of getting to know each other so I think going into the mitt qualifiers. I think yeah would confident going into it. I don't think we can be overly confident. I don't think we can underestimate chili. I've certainly never played them. I think most people are team heaven and they're not going to be an easy to use not give me a walkover. We know it's going to be tough. But you know, we're here we've got these six weeks preparing for it. We've got these great test matches against India who are very good side and I think the wind today against India organic. It was a lot of confidence sort of Had periods in that game already sort of have to dig really deep and defend and I'm sort of Road through that way, which I think's a massive learning on what we have in the product because in the parolee, we actually played some good hockey and patches. We just defensively were just sort of letting in goals. So I think now we if we can sort of settle a defensive it more keep that really strong and still have the attacking hockey that we sort of begin to sort of generate a through pro league then I think we can have a really good balance. It's and yeah, it gives us really good confidence. So it's fair to say that you kind of although it's been tough. You have kind of progress and you've come on. Yeah, I think it's just about building and learning and learning from those experiences. And that's the best way especially for our youngsters and lesson experience play it I think that's the best way for them to learn and so that's a really big benefit of as having your prodi's we have so many really highly competitive games that hope was hopefully status in really good Stead. These two matches against Chile in there are some players in the squad that experience like the 2014 World Cup. Yeah, which obviously isn't great and but then, you know a year later European Champions, you're after that Olympic Champions. I mean to those experiences kind of help you to sort of kind of say to the younger players that good times can be Round the Corner that makes sense. Really? I think it's important to say it doesn't matter where we are now if We all believe we can achieve something in a year's time definitely can achieve it for your stick to processes because there's a some of us in this room that have witnessed that and been through that and it has been done even though people on the outside might write you off I did before Rio as long as we as a group believer and a working towards that then anything can can happen. So I definitely think that gives you some confidence in the back of your head and it's important to give that message to youngsters. However, it's also important to You to say to them. It just doesn't just happen. So there has got to be changed over that period and he we do have to look at what we need to improve and we have to work really hard in training and training has to replicate our games. So it doesn't just happen. We have to work really hard and through that process. It will be tough. But if we all do that together, then we can achieve what we want to achieve the end of it. And if you've not played against Chile yourself, but what do you know what to be expecting from them when you play them I think watching obviously we've watched. Some of them and they look very in terms of how the Argentinian sort of style of play so and seeing some of the results from their some the world league. They won't be tough. They beat Japan fit three one and had a really good game there. So I don't think we can underestimate them. I think they've got some skillful and quick players and we're going to be careful of them on the brake and they will be tough to break down and I think we've got to expect that. It won't be a game where we sort of is a walk in the park. Is complying score line, we will have to work through all of it for the whole 60 minutes and the next game as well. I mean these these games are obviously absolutely massive, you know, arguably the biggest since the Rio fine. I mean, how do you kind of cope with the pressure of now do you go into those games and make sure you perform your best. I think it's just exactly same as how we approach the Olympics and the Really final it's just a matter of you've got these processes in place and if we do the processes and follow them step by step and don't look too far ahead in you're just focusing on the here and now or what we have to do right in this moment. Then when we get to that point, you will feel as prepared as you possibly can both individually and as a squad so that when we gets that moment, there isn't the pressure because we know we're in a really really good place and that's what we did go to Rio and that's what we did in the final and and and that's what we're trying to accomplish right now is is the training we're doing in these test matches and that is look who's up and all the preparation we Both in the meeting rooms and on the pitch that's just part of the processes that hopefully again enable us when we get to the second or third November is to win those games against Chile. So confident you can get it done. Yes. Yep. Excellent. That's what I wanted. Yeah. Awesome. So the clear message from the captain is one of quiet confidence. You definitely get the impression. She's not taking anything for granted. She's not under estimating the opposition but there is a tone of determination in her voice there and it feels like Holly Pern web will be ready as she always is whenever she steps out onto the pitch one of the players who could be Central to Great Britain's chances. This coming weekend will be Giselle Ansley. She's come to the fore as their Premier drag Flicker and I've spoken to her about the chili games about her role as the set piece specialist and a few more things besides that so here's what she had to say. A big couple of games coming up. So how's the mood in the in the group at the moment? Yeah, absolutely massive games coming up and I think the kind of the group just wants to kind of get there and play it and kind of get it done. So we're looking forward to it. There's definitely a sense of anticipation. That's for sure that we using kind of the weeks that we've got to you know, train really hard and make sure they'll make sure that we're as prepared as possible really and then Been working with Mark Hagar for a for a little while. Now you previously worked with Danny for what seemed like a really long time. I mean, how are you finding kind of the differences and what sort of things have you picked up from Mark? Yeah, I think Mark definitely brings that real attacking style pay that he wants that he wants us to implement and I think occasionally as a group we've taken out a little bit too far in terms of we've kind of gone all gung-ho and left us. Cells open to their counter-attack, but you know, he was writ Mark was really Keen to build on the defensive processes and principles that we had under Danny. He definitely admired them a lot and then he felt that he could bring in that attacking side of the game, which is you know, what we were really kind of looking for. So yeah for us, it's remembering what we learn under Danny in terms of all of the as I say the defensive structure and stuff and making sure that we don't go away. Fanatics I feel we definitely have periods of the last couple of months, but definitely now we're you know, we're starting to ensure that we keep that side of our game as well as try and develop that attacking attacking side of it. And yeah, he obviously gets really excited especially being a big goal scorer himself and his time. So, yeah, the the technical aspects of goalscoring as well have been brought into our training sessions a lot more which is really really good for us knowing that the pro league was a Obviously quite tough for you guys, perhaps didn't go as you would have hoped but I mean what sort of lessons have you taken out alarm what sort of things have you kind of what positives can you draw from you? Yeah, definitely the product we had our fair share of mixed results to be honest. We had some good performances, but didn't get the results. We had some okay results. not good performances that kind of thing and we also had a lot of people making debuts or first, you know, GB cat that kind of stuff and it was all you know very much trying to piece the jigsaw back together, I guess and yeah, we obviously with the change in Personnel a lot in terms of also having Mark come into in to coach us, I think We kind of took a long time to jail again and it was it was hard definitely and you know, I think I've been incredibly fortunate in my career that I've been a part of something incredibly strong teams, and I can't say that I've ever been a part of a team that had been on a run of losses and stuff like that which I mean it sounds ridiculous to say because I've been incredibly fortunate in in my career. Here. So, yeah, it was about us kind of picking myself up from that and accepting that you have to go through those periods in order to make the greatest gains again. So we learned a lot through that you know that you can't just expect things to happen. You can't just expect results to come to you. You have to make it happen. You have to play an entire 60 minutes and you know, it was also good for girls to get you know, that haven't really experienced and that much international hockey to get a flavor of hockey. I know what it's like at that top level every single week and that was something that none of us that are doing, you know, making sure that you play one week you've kind of got a debrief that but you've also then go to prepare for another game and the following week traveling on the road things like that. You know all was a huge learning curve for all of us and one that will definitely stand Us in good stead moving forwards or it's all about performing those one-off games. So hopefully, you know for us that's really good looking so qualifier. I gave us to lie, it will all be about, you know, winning that first game and then obviously on to the second game at straight after that. So yeah, there was a lot of learning for us and it was an incredible experience. And now we've seen you sort of stepping up its kind of the main penalty Corner Flickr for the soy does does that responsibility add some pressure to you or is that something that you've relish? Yeah, I definitely I'm not gonna lie at times you did. Definitely feel the pressure but you know as now a senior player and you know worked worked hard on it and but penalty Corner defenses are getting better goalkeepers are getting better. They'll try to beat Maddie. Yeah. So yeah, I definitely do feel responsibility. But I also think that with that's what comes with the nature of You know being a flicker or whatever off the top of the stuff the top and I do honest I quite liked it. I liked responsibility. There's something I've definitely thrived on and yeah come to the come to game time. I want I want to be called to flick, you know, that's that's what I want. So for me, yeah, if we were in a corner, I'm happy to step up there and take that kind of on my shoulders must feel good. And it run into the top corner and The Crowd Goes Nuts that must make it worthwhile. Yeah, absolutely. Definitely when it when it comes off and it you know, it hits the hits the back of the back of the net and you can celebrate. I think my celebrations kind of show how relieved I am that is a gun in but yeah, I know that definitely makes it worthwhile and with the chili games coming up he could argue there that be his Sky. Seems you guys have played since maybe the Rio final. So how do you sort of go into that and sort of, you know, try and prepare for such a big guy? Yeah, but by far they are the biggest games because obviously we had the Europeans and and they were a chance to qualify as well. But as soon as that chance is gone, this is your final chance essentially if we you know, you win this you're going to see them picks you losing your not If you think that like that then yeah probably the most pressure game that will ever play in the quit. It's an incredible opportunity. You know, we absolutely cannot underestimate chili. I myself have actually never played against some senior or Junior and technology in fact, so that is a new experience in itself. And but we've obviously got a lot of video. Oh and stuff on them. So we'll be absolutely 110 percent prepared for that game. And yes another chance to go out there and we're GB shirt and you know fight for this team and hockey in this country to have a another shot at an Olympic Games. It's pretty So plenty of insight into the mood in the Great Britain women's Camp ahead of their crunch tie with chili this coming weekend Great. Britain's men's team are also in action this coming weekend. They will face Malaysia in their Olympic qualifying play-off. I'd like to give you some interviews from the Great Britain men's Camp. However at the time of recording Great Britain Aki's media team have not yet. Out me the chance to speak to anyone from the men's side of things. So at the moment I'll have to make do some quotes from Danny carry from when the draw was made instead that he said Malaysia are a good side with some great individuals and a number of threats that having played them recently. It gives you that understanding of what that threat is. They have some good Corner routines and some very fast players who are individually skillful and they also have some very large aerial passes play. Well on the counter-attack and with a very experienced coach you enroll in Altman's will be very well prepared. We will respect them and prepare accordingly playing at Lee Valley Hockey and Tennis Center and having a home crowd is something I personally enjoy and I feel the athletes enjoy having the support behind us, too. It's a great atmosphere there and I think you'll be a cracking couple of days that myself and the athletes will really look forward to not ideal having me read that help but, you know make the best of the situation we've got any way. That's Danny carry touched upon in those quotes there Roland Altman's is the coach of the Malaysian side. He is a coach par Excellence. The Wily Dutchman is adept at preparing his size to be disciplined stick to their plan. Lan but he's very good at marrying that discipline with Malaysia sort of natural Flair and that's why there will be a handful for Great Britain and it didn't outstanding job as coach of India. Where as I say instill that discipline alongside the natural Flair and free-flowing ability of the side made them a really tough Prospect and them, you know, it's had a bit more time with Malaysia. I think the World Cup came a bit too soon for them. Because he'd only been in the job a short time. He's been there for a little while now. So, you know his his ideas and his tactics will be taking group have some absolutely wonderful players Malaysia fits all sorry Faisal. Sorry Razzie Raheem 10 Cooter Juden. They all have an absolute abundance of international experience loads of flair. The corner routines are excellent, and they're attacking threat is You know very very good. They will be no soft-touch whatsoever. I also have one of my favorite goalkeepers Kumar not the biggest and that 39 not the youngest very unorthodox, but fantastic to watch always a joy to see him play and he always looks like he's really enjoying himself as well. So I always look forward to seeing him turn out that being said. I hope he doesn't play that well because I want Great Britain to qualify. From a Great Britain standpoint Squad it looks as though Wales is Jacob Draper will be in the squad for his third Great Britain cap after he impressed in the European championships for his home nation won't be his debut for GB but it's third cap. I think which is quite the occasion to be winning it such an important weekend. I'm really Keen to see him rise to the occasion. And I'm sure he will is a very talented young player and Liam Sanford appears to be back in contention. The squad after a long injury lay-off his bravery and direct running in the Dan Fox role at penalty Corner defense could prove to be extremely useful. Especially given Malaysia's Potential Threat from set pieces. Other than that Zach Wallace and Phil Ropers creative spark will be one of the keys to unlocking the vistas defense and with Sam Ward up top. You've always got a chance obviously taking nothing to grow up for granted, but Woody no, Where the goal is has a very good girls to games ratio in international hockey and you can usually Bank on him to come up trumps for you. And I'm sure he'll be chomping at the bit to get out there. So yeah, nothing taken for granted. But personally, I don't normally do predictions, but I'm predicting that Great Britain will get the job done and I certainly hope that I am right on that front. Now it's time for the moment.
