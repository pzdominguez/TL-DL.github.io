â€“ Australia's women's hockey team will be going to the Olympics for the first time in 28 years after beating Russia in a playoff for a spot in Tokyo, the BBC reports. The Australians, who haven't been to the Olympics since Sydney 2000, led 2-0 after the first quarter and 3-1 after the second. But Russia scored twice in the last 10 minutes to tie the game and force a penalty shootout, which China won 4-3 after extra time. "We knew it was going to be a nail-biter, and we knew Russia was going to come back," Australian captain Kate Coyne tells the Guardian. "We knew it was going to be a nail-biter, and we knew China was going to come back and score some goals." The Australians, ranked fourth in the world, will be joined in Tokyo by Spain and the Netherlands.
